    <h2>
      PREFACE
    </h2>
    <p>
      What is exaggeration to one class of minds and perceptions, is plain truth
      to another. That which is commonly called a long-sight, perceives in a
      prospect innumerable features and bearings non-existent to a short-sighted
      person. I sometimes ask myself whether there may occasionally be a
      difference of this kind between some writers and some readers; whether it
      is <i>always</i> the writer who colours highly, or whether it is now and then the
      reader whose eye for colour is a little dull?
    </p>
    <p>
      On this head of exaggeration I have a positive experience, more curious
      than the speculation I have just set down. It is this: I have never
      touched a character precisely from the life, but some counterpart of that
      character has incredulously asked me: &ldquo;Now really, did I ever really, see
      one like it?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      All the Pecksniff family upon earth are quite agreed, I believe, that Mr
      Pecksniff is an exaggeration, and that no such character ever existed. I
      will not offer any plea on his behalf to so powerful and genteel a body,
      but will make a remark on the character of Jonas Chuzzlewit.
    </p>
    <p>
      I conceive that the sordid coarseness and brutality of Jonas would be
      unnatural, if there had been nothing in his early education, and in the
      precept and example always before him, to engender and develop the vices
      that make him odious. But, so born and so bred, admired for that which
      made him hateful, and justified from his cradle in cunning, treachery, and
      avarice; I claim him as the legitimate issue of the father upon whom those
      vices are seen to recoil. And I submit that their recoil upon that old
      man, in his unhonoured age, is not a mere piece of poetical justice, but
      is the extreme exposition of a direct truth.
    </p>
    <p>
      I make this comment, and solicit the reader&rsquo;s attention to it in his or
      her consideration of this tale, because nothing is more common in real
      life than a want of profitable reflection on the causes of many vices and
      crimes that awaken the general horror. What is substantially true of
      families in this respect, is true of a whole commonwealth. As we sow, we
      reap. Let the reader go into the children&rsquo;s side of any prison in England,
      or, I grieve to add, of many workhouses, and judge whether those are
      monsters who disgrace our streets, people our hulks and penitentiaries,
      and overcrowd our penal colonies, or are creatures whom we have
      deliberately suffered to be bred for misery and ruin.
    </p>
    <p>
      The American portion of this story is in no other respect a caricature
      than as it is an exhibition, for the most part (Mr Bevan expected), of a
      ludicrous side, <i>only</i>, of the American character&mdash;of that side which
      was, four-and-twenty years ago, from its nature, the most obtrusive, and
      the most likely to be seen by such travellers as Young Martin and Mark
      Tapley. As I had never, in writing fiction, had any disposition to soften
      what is ridiculous or wrong at home, so I then hoped that the good-humored
      people of the United States would not be generally disposed to quarrel
      with me for carrying the same usage abroad. I am happy to believe that my
      confidence in that great nation was not misplaced.
    </p>
    <p>
      When this book was first published, I was given to understand, by some
      authorities, that the Watertoast Association and eloquence were beyond all
      bounds of belief. Therefore I record the fact that all that portion of
      Martin Chuzzlewit&rsquo;s experiences is a literal paraphrase of some reports of
      public proceedings in the United States (especially of the proceedings of
      a certain Brandywine Association), which were printed in the Times
      Newspaper in June and July, 1843&mdash;at about the time when I was
      engaged in writing those parts of the book; and which remain on the file
      of the Times Newspaper, of course.
    </p>
    <p>
      In all my writings, I hope I have taken every available opportunity of
      showing the want of sanitary improvements in the neglected dwellings of
      the poor. Mrs Sarah Gamp was, four-and-twenty years ago, a fair
      representation of the hired attendant on the poor in sickness. The
      hospitals of London were, in many respects, noble Institutions; in others,
      very defective. I think it not the least among the instances of their
      mismanagement, that Mrs Betsey Prig was a fair specimen of a Hospital
      Nurse; and that the Hospitals, with their means and funds, should have
      left it to private humanity and enterprise, to enter on an attempt to
      improve that class of persons&mdash;since, greatly improved through the
      agency of good women.

    <h2>
      POSTSCRIPT
    </h2>
    <p>
      At a Public Dinner given to me on Saturday the 18th of April, 1868, in the
      city of New York, by two hundred representatives of the Press of the
      United States of America, I made the following observations, among others:&mdash;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;So much of my voice has lately been heard in the land, that I might have
      been contented with troubling you no further from my present
      standing-point, were it not a duty with which I henceforth charge myself,
      not only here but on every suitable occasion, whatsoever and wheresoever,
      to express my high and grateful sense of my second reception in America,
      and to bear my honest testimony to the national generosity and
      magnanimity. Also, to declare how astounded I have been by the amazing
      changes I have seen around me on every side&mdash;changes moral, changes
      physical, changes in the amount of land subdued and peopled, changes in
      the rise of vast new cities, changes in the growth of older cities almost
      out of recognition, changes in the graces and amenities of life, changes
      in the Press, without whose advancement no advancement can take place
      anywhere. Nor am I, believe me, so arrogant as to suppose that in
      five-and-twenty years there have been no changes in me, and that I had
      nothing to learn and no extreme impressions to correct when I was here
      first. And this brings me to a point on which I have, ever since I landed
      in the United States last November, observed a strict silence, though
      sometimes tempted to break it, but in reference to which I will, with your
      good leave, take you into my confidence now. Even the Press, being human,
      may be sometimes mistaken or misinformed, and I rather think that I have
      in one or two rare instances observed its information to be not strictly
      accurate with reference to myself. Indeed, I have, now and again, been
      more surprised by printed news that I have read of myself, than by any
      printed news that I have ever read in my present state of existence. Thus,
      the vigour and perseverance with which I have for some months past been
      collecting materials for, and hammering away at, a new book on America has
      much astonished me; seeing that all that time my declaration has been
      perfectly well known to my publishers on both sides of the Atlantic, that
      no consideration on earth would induce me to write one. But what I have
      intended, what I have resolved upon (and this is the confidence I seek to
      place in you), is, on my return to England, in my own person, in my own
      Journal, to bear, for the behoof of my countrymen, such testimony to the
      gigantic changes in this country as I have hinted at to-night. Also, to
      record that wherever I have been, in the smallest places equally with the
      largest, I have been received with unsurpassable politeness, delicacy,
      sweet temper, hospitality, consideration, and with unsurpassable respect
      for the privacy daily enforced upon me by the nature of my avocation here
      and the state of my health. This testimony, so long as I live, and so long
      as my descendants have any legal right in my books, I shall cause to be
      republished, as an appendix to every copy of those two books of mine in
      which I have referred to America. And this I will do and cause to be done,
      not in mere love and thankfulness, but because I regard it as an act of
      plain justice and honour.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      I said these words with the greatest earnestness that I could lay upon
      them, and I repeat them in print here with equal earnestness. So long as
      this book shall last, I hope that they will form a part of it, and will be
      fairly read as inseparable from my experiences and impressions of America.

      CHAPTER ONE
    </h2>
    <h3>
      INTRODUCTORY, CONCERNING THE PEDIGREE OF THE CHUZZLEWIT FAMILY
    </h3>
    <p>
      As no lady or gentleman, with any claims to polite breeding, can possibly
      sympathize with the Chuzzlewit Family without being first assured of the
      extreme antiquity of the race, it is a great satisfaction to know that it
      undoubtedly descended in a direct line from Adam and Eve; and was, in the
      very earliest times, closely connected with the agricultural interest. If
      it should ever be urged by grudging and malicious persons, that a
      Chuzzlewit, in any period of the family history, displayed an overweening
      amount of family pride, surely the weakness will be considered not only
      pardonable but laudable, when the immense superiority of the house to the
      rest of mankind, in respect of this its ancient origin, is taken into
      account.
    </p>
    <p>
      It is remarkable that as there was, in the oldest family of which we have
      any record, a murderer and a vagabond, so we never fail to meet, in the
      records of all old families, with innumerable repetitions of the same
      phase of character. Indeed, it may be laid down as a general principle,
      that the more extended the ancestry, the greater the amount of violence
      and vagabondism; for in ancient days those two amusements, combining a
      wholesome excitement with a promising means of repairing shattered
      fortunes, were at once the ennobling pursuit and the healthful recreation
      of the Quality of this land.
    </p>
    <p>
      Consequently, it is a source of inexpressible comfort and happiness to
      find, that in various periods of our history, the Chuzzlewits were
      actively connected with divers slaughterous conspiracies and bloody frays.
      It is further recorded of them, that being clad from head to heel in steel
      of proof, they did on many occasions lead their leather-jerkined soldiers
      to the death with invincible courage, and afterwards return home
      gracefully to their relations and friends.
    </p>
    <p>
      There can be no doubt that at least one Chuzzlewit came over with William
      the Conqueror. It does not appear that this illustrious ancestor &lsquo;came
      over&rsquo; that monarch, to employ the vulgar phrase, at any subsequent period;
      inasmuch as the Family do not seem to have been ever greatly distinguished
      by the possession of landed estate. And it is well known that for the
      bestowal of that kind of property upon his favourites, the liberality and
      gratitude of the Norman were as remarkable as those virtues are usually
      found to be in great men when they give away what belongs to other people.
    </p>
    <p>
      Perhaps in this place the history may pause to congratulate itself upon
      the enormous amount of bravery, wisdom, eloquence, virtue, gentle birth,
      and true nobility, that appears to have come into England with the Norman
      Invasion: an amount which the genealogy of every ancient family lends its
      aid to swell, and which would beyond all question have been found to be
      just as great, and to the full as prolific in giving birth to long lines
      of chivalrous descendants, boastful of their origin, even though William
      the Conqueror had been William the Conquered; a change of circumstances
      which, it is quite certain, would have made no manner of difference in
      this respect.
    </p>
    <p>
      There was unquestionably a Chuzzlewit in the Gunpowder Plot, if indeed the
      arch-traitor, Fawkes himself, were not a scion of this remarkable stock;
      as he might easily have been, supposing another Chuzzlewit to have
      emigrated to Spain in the previous generation, and there intermarried with
      a Spanish lady, by whom he had issue, one olive-complexioned son. This
      probable conjecture is strengthened, if not absolutely confirmed, by a
      fact which cannot fail to be interesting to those who are curious in
      tracing the progress of hereditary tastes through the lives of their
      unconscious inheritors. It is a notable circumstance that in these later
      times, many Chuzzlewits, being unsuccessful in other pursuits, have,
      without the smallest rational hope of enriching themselves, or any
      conceivable reason, set up as coal-merchants; and have, month after month,
      continued gloomily to watch a small stock of coals, without in any one
      instance negotiating with a purchaser. The remarkable similarity between
      this course of proceeding and that adopted by their Great Ancestor beneath
      the vaults of the Parliament House at Westminster, is too obvious and too
      full of interest, to stand in need of comment.
    </p>
    <p>
      It is also clearly proved by the oral traditions of the Family, that there
      existed, at some one period of its history which is not distinctly stated,
      a matron of such destructive principles, and so familiarized to the use
      and composition of inflammatory and combustible engines, that she was
      called &lsquo;The Match Maker;&rsquo; by which nickname and byword she is recognized
      in the Family legends to this day. Surely there can be no reasonable doubt
      that this was the Spanish lady, the mother of Chuzzlewit Fawkes.
    </p>
    <p>
      But there is one other piece of evidence, bearing immediate reference to
      their close connection with this memorable event in English History, which
      must carry conviction, even to a mind (if such a mind there be) remaining
      unconvinced by these presumptive proofs.
    </p>
    <p>
      There was, within a few years, in the possession of a highly respectable
      and in every way credible and unimpeachable member of the Chuzzlewit
      Family (for his bitterest enemy never dared to hint at his being otherwise
      than a wealthy man), a dark lantern of undoubted antiquity; rendered still
      more interesting by being, in shape and pattern, extremely like such as
      are in use at the present day. Now this gentleman, since deceased, was at
      all times ready to make oath, and did again and again set forth upon his
      solemn asseveration, that he had frequently heard his grandmother say,
      when contemplating this venerable relic, &lsquo;Aye, aye! This was carried by my
      fourth son on the fifth of November, when he was a Guy Fawkes.&rsquo; These
      remarkable words wrought (as well they might) a strong impression on his
      mind, and he was in the habit of repeating them very often. The just
      interpretation which they bear, and the conclusion to which they lead, are
      triumphant and irresistible. The old lady, naturally strong-minded, was
      nevertheless frail and fading; she was notoriously subject to that
      confusion of ideas, or, to say the least, of speech, to which age and
      garrulity are liable. The slight, the very slight, confusion apparent in
      these expressions is manifest, and is ludicrously easy of correction.
      &lsquo;Aye, aye,&rsquo; quoth she, and it will be observed that no emendation whatever
      is necessary to be made in these two initiative remarks, &lsquo;Aye, aye! This
      lantern was carried by my forefather&rsquo;&mdash;not fourth son, which is
      preposterous&mdash;&lsquo;on the fifth of November. And <i>he</i> was Guy Fawkes.&rsquo; Here
      we have a remark at once consistent, clear, natural, and in strict
      accordance with the character of the speaker. Indeed the anecdote is so
      plainly susceptible of this meaning and no other, that it would be hardly
      worth recording in its original state, were it not a proof of what may be
      (and very often is) affected not only in historical prose but in
      imaginative poetry, by the exercise of a little ingenious labour on the
      part of a commentator.
    </p>
    <p>
      It has been said that there is no instance, in modern times, of a
      Chuzzlewit having been found on terms of intimacy with the Great. But here
      again the sneering detractors who weave such miserable figments from their
      malicious brains, are stricken dumb by evidence. For letters are yet in
      the possession of various branches of the family, from which it distinctly
      appears, being stated in so many words, that one Diggory Chuzzlewit was in
      the habit of perpetually dining with Duke Humphrey. So constantly was he a
      guest at that nobleman&rsquo;s table, indeed; and so unceasingly were His
      Grace&rsquo;s hospitality and companionship forced, as it were, upon him; that
      we find him uneasy, and full of constraint and reluctance; writing his
      friends to the effect that if they fail to do so and so by bearer, he will
      have no choice but to dine again with Duke Humphrey; and expressing
      himself in a very marked and extraordinary manner as one surfeited of High
      Life and Gracious Company.
    </p>
    <p>
      It has been rumoured, and it is needless to say the rumour originated in
      the same base quarters, that a certain male Chuzzlewit, whose birth must
      be admitted to be involved in some obscurity, was of very mean and low
      descent. How stands the proof? When the son of that individual, to whom
      the secret of his father&rsquo;s birth was supposed to have been communicated by
      his father in his lifetime, lay upon his deathbed, this question was put
      to him in a distinct, solemn, and formal way: &lsquo;Toby Chuzzlewit, who was
      your grandfather?&rsquo; To which he, with his last breath, no less distinctly,
      solemnly, and formally replied: and his words were taken down at the time,
      and signed by six witnesses, each with his name and address in full: &lsquo;The
      Lord No Zoo.&rsquo; It may be said&mdash;it <i>has </i>been said, for human wickedness
      has no limits&mdash;that there is no Lord of that name, and that among the
      titles which have become extinct, none at all resembling this, in sound
      even, is to be discovered. But what is the irresistible inference?
      Rejecting a theory broached by some well-meaning but mistaken persons,
      that this Mr Toby Chuzzlewit&rsquo;s grandfather, to judge from his name, must
      surely have been a Mandarin (which is wholly insupportable, for there is
      no pretence of his grandmother ever having been out of this country, or of
      any Mandarin having been in it within some years of his father&rsquo;s birth;
      except those in the tea-shops, which cannot for a moment be regarded as
      having any bearing on the question, one way or other), rejecting this
      hypothesis, is it not manifest that Mr Toby Chuzzlewit had either received
      the name imperfectly from his father, or that he had forgotten it, or that
      he had mispronounced it? and that even at the recent period in question,
      the Chuzzlewits were connected by a bend sinister, or kind of heraldic
      over-the-left, with some unknown noble and illustrious House?
    </p>
    <p>
      From documentary evidence, yet preserved in the family, the fact is
      clearly established that in the comparatively modern days of the Diggory
      Chuzzlewit before mentioned, one of its members had attained to very great
      wealth and influence. Throughout such fragments of his correspondence as
      have escaped the ravages of the moths (who, in right of their extensive
      absorption of the contents of deeds and papers, may be called the general
      registers of the Insect World), we find him making constant reference to
      an uncle, in respect of whom he would seem to have entertained great
      expectations, as he was in the habit of seeking to propitiate his favour
      by presents of plate, jewels, books, watches, and other valuable articles.
      Thus, he writes on one occasion to his brother in reference to a
      gravy-spoon, the brother&rsquo;s property, which he (Diggory) would appear to
      have borrowed or otherwise possessed himself of: &lsquo;Do not be angry, I have
      parted with it&mdash;to my uncle.&rsquo; On another occasion he expresses
      himself in a similar manner with regard to a child&rsquo;s mug which had been
      entrusted to him to get repaired. On another occasion he says, &lsquo;I have
      bestowed upon that irresistible uncle of mine everything I ever
      possessed.&rsquo; And that he was in the habit of paying long and constant
      visits to this gentleman at his mansion, if, indeed, he did not wholly
      reside there, is manifest from the following sentence: &lsquo;With the exception
      of the suit of clothes I carry about with me, the whole of my wearing
      apparel is at present at my uncle&rsquo;s.&rsquo; This gentleman&rsquo;s patronage and
      influence must have been very extensive, for his nephew writes, &lsquo;His
      interest is too high&rsquo;&mdash;&lsquo;It is too much&rsquo;&mdash;&lsquo;It is tremendous&rsquo;&mdash;and
      the like. Still it does not appear (which is strange) to have procured for
      him any lucrative post at court or elsewhere, or to have conferred upon
      him any other distinction than that which was necessarily included in the
      countenance of so great a man, and the being invited by him to certain
      entertainment&rsquo;s, so splendid and costly in their nature, that he calls
      them &lsquo;Golden Balls.&rsquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      It is needless to multiply instances of the high and lofty station, and
      the vast importance of the Chuzzlewits, at different periods. If it came
      within the scope of reasonable probability that further proofs were
      required, they might be heaped upon each other until they formed an Alps
      of testimony, beneath which the boldest scepticism should be crushed and
      beaten flat. As a goodly tumulus is already collected, and decently
      battened up above the Family grave, the present chapter is content to
      leave it as it is: merely adding, by way of a final spadeful, that many
      Chuzzlewits, both male and female, are proved to demonstration, on the
      faith of letters written by their own mothers, to have had chiselled
      noses, undeniable chins, forms that might have served the sculptor for a
      model, exquisitely-turned limbs and polished foreheads of so transparent a
      texture that the blue veins might be seen branching off in various
      directions, like so many roads on an ethereal map. This fact in itself,
      though it had been a solitary one, would have utterly settled and clenched
      the business in hand; for it is well known, on the authority of all the
      books which treat of such matters, that every one of these phenomena, but
      especially that of the chiselling, are invariably peculiar to, and only
      make themselves apparent in, persons of the very best condition.
    </p>
    <p>
      This history having, to its own perfect satisfaction, (and, consequently,
      to the full contentment of all its readers,) proved the Chuzzlewits to
      have had an origin, and to have been at one time or other of an importance
      which cannot fail to render them highly improving and acceptable
      acquaintance to all right-minded individuals, may now proceed in earnest
      with its task. And having shown that they must have had, by reason of
      their ancient birth, a pretty large share in the foundation and increase
      of the human family, it will one day become its province to submit, that
      such of its members as shall be introduced in these pages, have still many
      counterparts and prototypes in the Great World about us. At present it
      contents itself with remarking, in a general way, on this head: Firstly,
      that it may be safely asserted, and yet without implying any direct
      participation in the Manboddo doctrine touching the probability of the
      human race having once been monkeys, that men do play very strange and
      extraordinary tricks. Secondly, and yet without trenching on the
      Blumenbach theory as to the descendants of Adam having a vast number of
      qualities which belong more particularly to swine than to any other class
      of animals in the creation, that some men certainly are remarkable for
      taking uncommon good care of themselves.

      CHAPTER TWO
    </h2>
    <p>
      WHEREIN CERTAIN PERSONS ARE PRESENTED TO THE READER, WITH WHOM HE MAY, IF
      HE PLEASE, BECOME BETTER ACQUAINTED
    </p>
    <p>
      It was pretty late in the autumn of the year, when the declining sun
      struggling through the mist which had obscured it all day, looked brightly
      down upon a little Wiltshire village, within an easy journey of the fair
      old town of Salisbury.
    </p>
    <p>
      Like a sudden flash of memory or spirit kindling up the mind of an old
      man, it shed a glory upon the scene, in which its departed youth and
      freshness seemed to live again. The wet grass sparkled in the light; the
      scanty patches of verdure in the hedges&mdash;where a few green twigs yet
      stood together bravely, resisting to the last the tyranny of nipping winds
      and early frosts&mdash;took heart and brightened up; the stream which had
      been dull and sullen all day long, broke out into a cheerful smile; the
      birds began to chirp and twitter on the naked boughs, as though the
      hopeful creatures half believed that winter had gone by, and spring had
      come already. The vane upon the tapering spire of the old church glistened
      from its lofty station in sympathy with the general gladness; and from the
      ivy-shaded windows such gleams of light shone back upon the glowing sky,
      that it seemed as if the quiet buildings were the hoarding-place of twenty
      summers, and all their ruddiness and warmth were stored within.
    </p>
    <p>
      Even those tokens of the season which emphatically whispered of the coming
      winter, graced the landscape, and, for the moment, tinged its livelier
      features with no oppressive air of sadness. The fallen leaves, with which
      the ground was strewn, gave forth a pleasant fragrance, and subduing all
      harsh sounds of distant feet and wheels created a repose in gentle unison
      with the light scattering of seed hither and thither by the distant
      husbandman, and with the noiseless passage of the plough as it turned up
      the rich brown earth, and wrought a graceful pattern in the stubbled
      fields. On the motionless branches of some trees, autumn berries hung like
      clusters of coral beads, as in those fabled orchards where the fruits were
      jewels; others stripped of all their garniture, stood, each the centre of
      its little heap of bright red leaves, watching their slow decay; others
      again, still wearing theirs, had them all crunched and crackled up, as
      though they had been burnt; about the stems of some were piled, in ruddy
      mounds, the apples they had borne that year; while others (hardy
      evergreens this class) showed somewhat stern and gloomy in their vigour,
      as charged by nature with the admonition that it is not to her more
      sensitive and joyous favourites she grants the longest term of life. Still
      athwart their darker boughs, the sunbeams struck out paths of deeper gold;
      and the red light, mantling in among their swarthy branches, used them as
      foils to set its brightness off, and aid the lustre of the dying day.
    </p>
    <p>
      A moment, and its glory was no more. The sun went down beneath the long
      dark lines of hill and cloud which piled up in the west an airy city, wall
      heaped on wall, and battlement on battlement; the light was all withdrawn;
      the shining church turned cold and dark; the stream forgot to smile; the
      birds were silent; and the gloom of winter dwelt on everything.
    </p>
    <p>
      An evening wind uprose too, and the slighter branches cracked and rattled
      as they moved, in skeleton dances, to its moaning music. The withering
      leaves no longer quiet, hurried to and fro in search of shelter from its
      chill pursuit; the labourer unyoked his horses, and with head bent down,
      trudged briskly home beside them; and from the cottage windows lights
      began to glance and wink upon the darkening fields.
    </p>
    <p>
      Then the village forge came out in all its bright importance. The lusty
      bellows roared Ha ha! to the clear fire, which roared in turn, and bade
      the shining sparks dance gayly to the merry clinking of the hammers on the
      anvil. The gleaming iron, in its emulation, sparkled too, and shed its
      red-hot gems around profusely. The strong smith and his men dealt such
      strokes upon their work, as made even the melancholy night rejoice, and
      brought a glow into its dark face as it hovered about the door and
      windows, peeping curiously in above the shoulders of a dozen loungers. As
      to this idle company, there they stood, spellbound by the place, and,
      casting now and then a glance upon the darkness in their rear, settled
      their lazy elbows more at ease upon the sill, and leaned a little further
      in: no more disposed to tear themselves away than if they had been born to
      cluster round the blazing hearth like so many crickets.
    </p>
    <p>
      Out upon the angry wind! how from sighing, it began to bluster round the
      merry forge, banging at the wicket, and grumbling in the chimney, as if it
      bullied the jolly bellows for doing anything to order. And what an
      impotent swaggerer it was too, for all its noise; for if it had any
      influence on that hoarse companion, it was but to make him roar his
      cheerful song the louder, and by consequence to make the fire burn the
      brighter, and the sparks to dance more gayly yet; at length, they whizzed
      so madly round and round, that it was too much for such a surly wind to
      bear; so off it flew with a howl giving the old sign before the ale-house
      door such a cuff as it went, that the Blue Dragon was more rampant than
      usual ever afterwards, and indeed, before Christmas, reared clean out of
      its crazy frame.
    </p>
    <p>
      It was small tyranny for a respectable wind to go wreaking its vengeance
      on such poor creatures as the fallen leaves, but this wind happening to
      come up with a great heap of them just after venting its humour on the
      insulted Dragon, did so disperse and scatter them that they fled away,
      pell-mell, some here, some there, rolling over each other, whirling round
      and round upon their thin edges, taking frantic flights into the air, and
      playing all manner of extraordinary gambols in the extremity of their
      distress. Nor was this enough for its malicious fury; for not content with
      driving them abroad, it charged small parties of them and hunted them into
      the wheel wright&rsquo;s saw-pit, and below the planks and timbers in the yard,
      and, scattering the sawdust in the air, it looked for them underneath, and
      when it did meet with any, whew! how it drove them on and followed at
      their heels!
    </p>
    <p>
      The scared leaves only flew the faster for all this, and a giddy chase it
      was; for they got into unfrequented places, where there was no outlet, and
      where their pursuer kept them eddying round and round at his pleasure; and
      they crept under the eaves of houses, and clung tightly to the sides of
      hay-ricks, like bats; and tore in at open chamber windows, and cowered
      close to hedges; and, in short, went anywhere for safety. But the oddest
      feat they achieved was, to take advantage of the sudden opening of Mr
      Pecksniff&rsquo;s front-door, to dash wildly into his passage; whither the wind
      following close upon them, and finding the back-door open, incontinently
      blew out the lighted candle held by Miss Pecksniff, and slammed the
      front-door against Mr Pecksniff who was at that moment entering, with such
      violence, that in the twinkling of an eye he lay on his back at the bottom
      of the steps. Being by this time weary of such trifling performances, the
      boisterous rover hurried away rejoicing, roaring over moor and meadow,
      hill and flat, until it got out to sea, where it met with other winds
      similarly disposed, and made a night of it.
    </p>
    <p>
      In the meantime Mr Pecksniff, having received from a sharp angle in the
      bottom step but one, that sort of knock on the head which lights up, for
      the patient&rsquo;s entertainment, an imaginary general illumination of very
      bright short-sixes, lay placidly staring at his own street door. And it
      would seem to have been more suggestive in its aspect than street doors
      usually are; for he continued to lie there, rather a lengthy and
      unreasonable time, without so much as wondering whether he was hurt or no;
      neither, when Miss Pecksniff inquired through the key-hole in a shrill
      voice, which might have belonged to a wind in its teens, &lsquo;Who&rsquo;s there&rsquo; did
      he make any reply; nor, when Miss Pecksniff opened the door again, and
      shading the candle with her hand, peered out, and looked provokingly round
      him, and about him, and over him, and everywhere but at him, did he offer
      any remark, or indicate in any manner the least hint of a desire to be
      picked up.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;I see you,&rsquo; cried Miss Pecksniff, to the ideal inflicter of a runaway
      knock. &lsquo;You&rsquo;ll catch it, sir!&rsquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      Still Mr Pecksniff, perhaps from having caught it already, said nothing.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;You&rsquo;re round the corner now,&rsquo; cried Miss Pecksniff. She said it at a
      venture, but there was appropriate matter in it too; for Mr Pecksniff,
      being in the act of extinguishing the candles before mentioned pretty
      rapidly, and of reducing the number of brass knobs on his street door from
      four or five hundred (which had previously been juggling of their own
      accord before his eyes in a very novel manner) to a dozen or so, might in
      one sense have been said to be coming round the corner, and just turning
      it.
    </p>
    <p>
      With a sharply delivered warning relative to the cage and the constable,
      and the stocks and the gallows, Miss Pecksniff was about to close the door
      again, when Mr Pecksniff (being still at the bottom of the steps) raised
      himself on one elbow, and sneezed.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;That voice!&rsquo; cried Miss Pecksniff. &lsquo;My parent!&rsquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      At this exclamation, another Miss Pecksniff bounced out of the parlour;
      and the two Miss Pecksniffs, with many incoherent expressions, dragged Mr
      Pecksniff into an upright posture.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Pa!&rsquo; they cried in concert. &lsquo;Pa! Speak, Pa! Do not look so wild my
      dearest Pa!&rsquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      But as a gentleman&rsquo;s looks, in such a case of all others, are by no means
      under his own control, Mr Pecksniff continued to keep his mouth and his
      eyes very wide open, and to drop his lower jaw, somewhat after the manner
      of a toy nut-cracker; and as his hat had fallen off, and his face was
      pale, and his hair erect, and his coat muddy, the spectacle he presented
      was so very doleful, that neither of the Miss Pecksniffs could repress an
      involuntary screech.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;That&rsquo;ll do,&rsquo; said Mr Pecksniff. &lsquo;I&rsquo;m better.&rsquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;He&rsquo;s come to himself!&rsquo; cried the youngest Miss Pecksniff.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;He speaks again!&rsquo; exclaimed the eldest.
    </p>
    <p>
      With these joyful words they kissed Mr Pecksniff on either cheek; and bore
      him into the house. Presently, the youngest Miss Pecksniff ran out again
      to pick up his hat, his brown paper parcel, his umbrella, his gloves, and
      other small articles; and that done, and the door closed, both young
      ladies applied themselves to tending Mr Pecksniff&rsquo;s wounds in the back
      parlour.
    </p>
    <p>
      They were not very serious in their nature; being limited to abrasions on
      what the eldest Miss Pecksniff called &lsquo;the knobby parts&rsquo; of her parent&rsquo;s
      anatomy, such as his knees and elbows, and to the development of an
      entirely new organ, unknown to phrenologists, on the back of his head.
      These injuries having been comforted externally, with patches of pickled
      brown paper, and Mr Pecksniff having been comforted internally, with some
      stiff brandy-and-water, the eldest Miss Pecksniff sat down to make the
      tea, which was all ready. In the meantime the youngest Miss Pecksniff
      brought from the kitchen a smoking dish of ham and eggs, and, setting the
      same before her father, took up her station on a low stool at his feet;
      thereby bringing her eyes on a level with the teaboard.
    </p>
    <p>
      It must not be inferred from this position of humility, that the youngest
      Miss Pecksniff was so young as to be, as one may say, forced to sit upon a
      stool, by reason of the shortness of her legs. Miss Pecksniff sat upon a
      stool because of her simplicity and innocence, which were very great, very
      great. Miss Pecksniff sat upon a stool because she was all girlishness,
      and playfulness, and wildness, and kittenish buoyancy. She was the most
      arch and at the same time the most artless creature, was the youngest Miss
      Pecksniff, that you can possibly imagine. It was her great charm. She was
      too fresh and guileless, and too full of child-like vivacity, was the
      youngest Miss Pecksniff, to wear combs in her hair, or to turn it up, or
      to frizzle it, or braid it. She wore it in a crop, a loosely flowing crop,
      which had so many rows of curls in it, that the top row was only one curl.
      Moderately buxom was her shape, and quite womanly too; but sometimes&mdash;yes,
      sometimes&mdash;she even wore a pinafore; and how charming <i>that </i>was! Oh!
      she was indeed &lsquo;a gushing thing&rsquo; (as a young gentleman had observed in
      verse, in the Poet&rsquo;s Corner of a provincial newspaper), was the youngest
      Miss Pecksniff!
    </p>
    <p>
      Mr Pecksniff was a moral man&mdash;a grave man, a man of noble sentiments
      and speech&mdash;and he had had her christened Mercy. Mercy! oh, what a
      charming name for such a pure-souled Being as the youngest Miss Pecksniff!
      Her sister&rsquo;s name was Charity. There was a good thing! Mercy and Charity!
      And Charity, with her fine strong sense and her mild, yet not reproachful
      gravity, was so well named, and did so well set off and illustrate her
      sister! What a pleasant sight was that the contrast they presented; to see
      each loved and loving one sympathizing with, and devoted to, and leaning
      on, and yet correcting and counter-checking, and, as it were, antidoting,
      the other! To behold each damsel in her very admiration of her sister,
      setting up in business for herself on an entirely different principle, and
      announcing no connection with over-the-way, and if the quality of goods at
      that establishment don&rsquo;t please you, you are respectfully invited to
      favour <i>me</i> with a call! And the crowning circumstance of the whole
      delightful catalogue was, that both the fair creatures were so utterly
      unconscious of all this! They had no idea of it. They no more thought or
      dreamed of it than Mr Pecksniff did. Nature played them off against each
      other; <i>they </i>had no hand in it, the two Miss Pecksniffs.
    </p>
    <p>
      It has been remarked that Mr Pecksniff was a moral man. So he was. Perhaps
      there never was a more moral man than Mr Pecksniff, especially in his
      conversation and correspondence. It was once said of him by a homely
      admirer, that he had a Fortunatus&rsquo;s purse of good sentiments in his
      inside. In this particular he was like the girl in the fairy tale, except
      that if they were not actual diamonds which fell from his lips, they were
      the very brightest paste, and shone prodigiously. He was a most exemplary
      man; fuller of virtuous precept than a copy book. Some people likened him
      to a direction-post, which is always telling the way to a place, and never
      goes there; but these were his enemies, the shadows cast by his
      brightness; that was all. His very throat was moral. You saw a good deal
      of it. You looked over a very low fence of white cravat (whereof no man
      had ever beheld the tie for he fastened it behind), and there it lay, a
      valley between two jutting heights of collar, serene and whiskerless
      before you. It seemed to say, on the part of Mr Pecksniff, &lsquo;There is no
      deception, ladies and gentlemen, all is peace, a holy calm pervades me.&rsquo;
      So did his hair, just grizzled with an iron-grey which was all brushed off
      his forehead, and stood bolt upright, or slightly drooped in kindred
      action with his heavy eyelids. So did his person, which was sleek though
      free from corpulency. So did his manner, which was soft and oily. In a
      word, even his plain black suit, and state of widower and dangling double
      eye-glass, all tended to the same purpose, and cried aloud, &lsquo;Behold the
      moral Pecksniff!&rsquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      The brazen plate upon the door (which being Mr Pecksniff&rsquo;s, could not lie)
      bore this inscription, &lsquo;PECKSNIFF, ARCHITECT,&rsquo; to which Mr Pecksniff, on
      his cards of business, added, AND LAND SURVEYOR.&rsquo; In one sense, and only
      one, he may be said to have been a Land Surveyor on a pretty large scale,
      as an extensive prospect lay stretched out before the windows of his
      house. Of his architectural doings, nothing was clearly known, except that
      he had never designed or built anything; but it was generally understood
      that his knowledge of the science was almost awful in its profundity.
    </p>
    <p>
      Mr Pecksniff&rsquo;s professional engagements, indeed, were almost, if not
      entirely, confined to the reception of pupils; for the collection of
      rents, with which pursuit he occasionally varied and relieved his graver
      toils, can hardly be said to be a strictly architectural employment. His
      genius lay in ensnaring parents and guardians, and pocketing premiums. A
      young gentleman&rsquo;s premium being paid, and the young gentleman come to Mr
      Pecksniff&rsquo;s house, Mr Pecksniff borrowed his case of mathematical
      instruments (if silver-mounted or otherwise valuable); entreated him, from
      that moment, to consider himself one of the family; complimented him
      highly on his parents or guardians, as the case might be; and turned him
      loose in a spacious room on the two-pair front; where, in the company of
      certain drawing-boards, parallel rulers, very stiff-legged compasses, and
      two, or perhaps three, other young gentlemen, he improved himself, for
      three or five years, according to his articles, in making elevations of
      Salisbury Cathedral from every possible point of sight; and in
      constructing in the air a vast quantity of Castles, Houses of Parliament,
      and other Public Buildings. Perhaps in no place in the world were so many
      gorgeous edifices of this class erected as under Mr Pecksniff&rsquo;s auspices;
      and if but one-twentieth part of the churches which were built in that
      front room, with one or other of the Miss Pecksniffs at the altar in the
      act of marrying the architect, could only be made available by the
      parliamentary commissioners, no more churches would be wanted for at least
      five centuries.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Even the worldly goods of which we have just disposed,&rsquo; said Mr
      Pecksniff, glancing round the table when he had finished, &lsquo;even cream,
      sugar, tea, toast, ham&mdash;&rsquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;And eggs,&rsquo; suggested Charity in a low voice.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;And eggs,&rsquo; said Mr Pecksniff, &lsquo;even they have their moral. See how they
      come and go! Every pleasure is transitory. We can&rsquo;t even eat, long. If we
      indulge in harmless fluids, we get the dropsy; if in exciting liquids, we
      get drunk. What a soothing reflection is that!&rsquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Don&rsquo;t say <i>we</i> get drunk, Pa,&rsquo; urged the eldest Miss Pecksniff.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;When I say we, my dear,&rsquo; returned her father, &lsquo;I mean mankind in general;
      the human race, considered as a body, and not as individuals. There is
      nothing personal in morality, my love. Even such a thing as this,&rsquo; said Mr
      Pecksniff, laying the fore-finger of his left hand upon the brown paper
      patch on the top of his head, &lsquo;slight casual baldness though it be,
      reminds us that we are but&rsquo;&mdash;he was going to say &lsquo;worms,&rsquo; but
      recollecting that worms were not remarkable for heads of hair, he
      substituted &lsquo;flesh and blood.&rsquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Which,&rsquo; cried Mr Pecksniff after a pause, during which he seemed to have
      been casting about for a new moral, and not quite successfully, &lsquo;which is
      also very soothing. Mercy, my dear, stir the fire and throw up the
      cinders.&rsquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      The young lady obeyed, and having done so, resumed her stool, reposed one
      arm upon her father&rsquo;s knee, and laid her blooming cheek upon it. Miss
      Charity drew her chair nearer the fire, as one prepared for conversation,
      and looked towards her father.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Yes,&rsquo; said Mr Pecksniff, after a short pause, during which he had been
      silently smiling, and shaking his head at the fire&mdash;&lsquo;I have again
      been fortunate in the attainment of my object. A new inmate will very
      shortly come among us.&rsquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;A youth, papa?&rsquo; asked Charity.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Ye-es, a youth,&rsquo; said Mr Pecksniff. &lsquo;He will avail himself of the
      eligible opportunity which now offers, for uniting the advantages of the
      best practical architectural education with the comforts of a home, and
      the constant association with some who (however humble their sphere, and
      limited their capacity) are not unmindful of their moral
      responsibilities.&rsquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Oh Pa!&rsquo; cried Mercy, holding up her finger archly. &lsquo;See advertisement!&rsquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Playful&mdash;playful warbler,&rsquo; said Mr Pecksniff. It may be observed in
      connection with his calling his daughter a &lsquo;warbler,&rsquo; that she was not at
      all vocal, but that Mr Pecksniff was in the frequent habit of using any
      word that occurred to him as having a good sound, and rounding a sentence
      well without much care for its meaning. And he did this so boldly, and in
      such an imposing manner, that he would sometimes stagger the wisest people
      with his eloquence, and make them gasp again.
    </p>
    <p>
      His enemies asserted, by the way, that a strong trustfulness in sounds and
      forms was the master-key to Mr Pecksniff&rsquo;s character.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Is he handsome, Pa?&rsquo; inquired the younger daughter.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Silly Merry!&rsquo; said the eldest: Merry being fond for Mercy. &lsquo;What is the
      premium, Pa? tell us that.&rsquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Oh, good gracious, Cherry!&rsquo; cried Miss Mercy, holding up her hands with
      the most winning giggle in the world, &lsquo;what a mercenary girl you are! oh
      you naughty, thoughtful, prudent thing!&rsquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      It was perfectly charming, and worthy of the Pastoral age, to see how the
      two Miss Pecksniffs slapped each other after this, and then subsided into
      an embrace expressive of their different dispositions.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;He is well looking,&rsquo; said Mr Pecksniff, slowly and distinctly; &lsquo;well
      looking enough. I do not positively expect any immediate premium with
      him.&rsquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      Notwithstanding their different natures, both Charity and Mercy concurred
      in opening their eyes uncommonly wide at this announcement, and in looking
      for the moment as blank as if their thoughts had actually had a direct
      bearing on the main chance.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;But what of that!&rsquo; said Mr Pecksniff, still smiling at the fire. &lsquo;There
      is disinterestedness in the world, I hope? We are not all arrayed in two
      opposite ranks; the <i>of</i>fensive and the <i>de</i>fensive. Some few there are who
      walk between; who help the needy as they go; and take no part with either
      side. Umph!&rsquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      There was something in these morsels of philanthropy which reassured the
      sisters. They exchanged glances, and brightened very much.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Oh! let us not be for ever calculating, devising, and plotting for the
      future,&rsquo; said Mr Pecksniff, smiling more and more, and looking at the fire
      as a man might, who was cracking a joke with it: &lsquo;I am weary of such arts.
      If our inclinations are but good and open-hearted, let us gratify them
      boldly, though they bring upon us Loss instead of Profit. Eh, Charity?&rsquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      Glancing towards his daughters for the first time since he had begun these
      reflections, and seeing that they both smiled, Mr Pecksniff eyed them for
      an instant so jocosely (though still with a kind of saintly waggishness)
      that the younger one was moved to sit upon his knee forthwith, put her
      fair arms round his neck, and kiss him twenty times. During the whole of
      this affectionate display she laughed to a most immoderate extent: in
      which hilarious indulgence even the prudent Cherry joined.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Tut, tut,&rsquo; said Mr Pecksniff, pushing his latest-born away and running
      his fingers through his hair, as he resumed his tranquil face. &lsquo;What folly
      is this! Let us take heed how we laugh without reason lest we cry with it.
      What is the domestic news since yesterday? John Westlock is gone, I hope?&rsquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Indeed, no,&rsquo; said Charity.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;And why not?&rsquo; returned her father. &lsquo;His term expired yesterday. And his
      box was packed, I know; for I saw it, in the morning, standing in the
      hall.&rsquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;He slept last night at the Dragon,&rsquo; returned the young lady, &lsquo;and had Mr
      Pinch to dine with him. They spent the evening together, and Mr Pinch was
      not home till very late.&rsquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;And when I saw him on the stairs this morning, Pa,&rsquo; said Mercy with her
      usual sprightliness, &lsquo;he looked, oh goodness, <i>such </i>a monster! with his
      face all manner of colours, and his eyes as dull as if they had been
      boiled, and his head aching dreadfully, I am sure from the look of it, and
      his clothes smelling, oh it&rsquo;s impossible to say how strong, oh&rsquo;&mdash;here
      the young lady shuddered&mdash;&lsquo;of smoke and punch.&rsquo;
    </p>

<div class="fig" style="width:65%">

    </div>
    <h5>
      <a href="images/20059.jpg"><i>Original</i></a>
    </h5>

    <p>
      &lsquo;Now I think,&rsquo; said Mr Pecksniff with his accustomed gentleness, though
      still with the air of one who suffered under injury without complaint, &lsquo;I
      think Mr Pinch might have done better than choose for his companion one
      who, at the close of a long intercourse, had endeavoured, as he knew, to
      wound my feelings. I am not quite sure that this was delicate in Mr Pinch.
      I am not quite sure that this was kind in Mr Pinch. I will go further and
      say, I am not quite sure that this was even ordinarily grateful in Mr
      Pinch.&rsquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;But what can anyone expect from Mr Pinch!&rsquo; cried Charity, with as strong
      and scornful an emphasis on the name as if it would have given her
      unspeakable pleasure to express it, in an acted charade, on the calf of
      that gentleman&rsquo;s leg.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Aye, aye,&rsquo; returned her father, raising his hand mildly: &lsquo;it is very well
      to say what can we expect from Mr Pinch, but Mr Pinch is a
      fellow-creature, my dear; Mr Pinch is an item in the vast total of
      humanity, my love; and we have a right, it is our duty, to expect in Mr
      Pinch some development of those better qualities, the possession of which
      in our own persons inspires our humble self-respect. No,&rsquo; continued Mr
      Pecksniff. &lsquo;No! Heaven forbid that I should say, nothing can be expected
      from Mr Pinch; or that I should say, nothing can be expected from any man
      alive (even the most degraded, which Mr Pinch is not, no, really); but Mr
      Pinch has disappointed me; he has hurt me; I think a little the worse of
      him on this account, but not if human nature. Oh, no, no!&rsquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Hark!&rsquo; said Miss Charity, holding up her finger, as a gentle rap was
      heard at the street door. &lsquo;There is the creature! Now mark my words, he
      has come back with John Westlock for his box, and is going to help him to
      take it to the mail. Only mark my words, if that isn&rsquo;t his intention!&rsquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      Even as she spoke, the box appeared to be in progress of conveyance from
      the house, but after a brief murmuring of question and answer, it was put
      down again, and somebody knocked at the parlour door.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Come in!&rsquo; cried Mr Pecksniff&mdash;not severely; only virtuously. &lsquo;Come
      in!&rsquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      An ungainly, awkward-looking man, extremely short-sighted, and prematurely
      bald, availed himself of this permission; and seeing that Mr Pecksniff sat
      with his back towards him, gazing at the fire, stood hesitating, with the
      door in his hand. He was far from handsome certainly; and was drest in a
      snuff-coloured suit, of an uncouth make at the best, which, being shrunk
      with long wear, was twisted and tortured into all kinds of odd shapes; but
      notwithstanding his attire, and his clumsy figure, which a great stoop in
      his shoulders, and a ludicrous habit he had of thrusting his head forward,
      by no means redeemed, one would not have been disposed (unless Mr
      Pecksniff said so) to consider him a bad fellow by any means. He was
      perhaps about thirty, but he might have been almost any age between
      sixteen and sixty; being one of those strange creatures who never decline
      into an ancient appearance, but look their oldest when they are very
      young, and get it over at once.
    </p>
    <p>
      Keeping his hand upon the lock of the door, he glanced from Mr Pecksniff
      to Mercy, from Mercy to Charity, and from Charity to Mr Pecksniff again,
      several times; but the young ladies being as intent upon the fire as their
      father was, and neither of the three taking any notice of him, he was fain
      to say, at last,
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Oh! I beg your pardon, Mr Pecksniff: I beg your pardon for intruding; but&mdash;&rsquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;No intrusion, Mr Pinch,&rsquo; said that gentleman very sweetly, but without
      looking round. &lsquo;Pray be seated, Mr Pinch. Have the goodness to shut the
      door, Mr Pinch, if you please.&rsquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Certainly, sir,&rsquo; said Pinch; not doing so, however, but holding it rather
      wider open than before, and beckoning nervously to somebody without: &lsquo;Mr
      Westlock, sir, hearing that you were come home&mdash;&rsquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Mr Pinch, Mr Pinch!&rsquo; said Pecksniff, wheeling his chair about, and
      looking at him with an aspect of the deepest melancholy, &lsquo;I did not expect
      this from you. I have not deserved this from you!&rsquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;No, but upon my word, sir&mdash;&rsquo; urged Pinch.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;The less you say, Mr Pinch,&rsquo; interposed the other, &lsquo;the better. I utter
      no complaint. Make no defence.&rsquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;No, but do have the goodness, sir,&rsquo; cried Pinch, with great earnestness,
      &lsquo;if you please. Mr Westlock, sir, going away for good and all, wishes to
      leave none but friends behind him. Mr Westlock and you, sir, had a little
      difference the other day; you have had many little differences.&rsquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Little differences!&rsquo; cried Charity.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Little differences!&rsquo; echoed Mercy.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;My loves!&rsquo; said Mr Pecksniff, with the same serene upraising of his hand;
      &lsquo;My dears!&rsquo; After a solemn pause he meekly bowed to Mr Pinch, as who
      should say, &lsquo;Proceed;&rsquo; but Mr Pinch was so very much at a loss how to
      resume, and looked so helplessly at the two Miss Pecksniffs, that the
      conversation would most probably have terminated there, if a good-looking
      youth, newly arrived at man&rsquo;s estate, had not stepped forward from the
      doorway and taken up the thread of the discourse.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Come, Mr Pecksniff,&rsquo; he said, with a smile, &lsquo;don&rsquo;t let there be any
      ill-blood between us, pray. I am sorry we have ever differed, and
      extremely sorry I have ever given you offence. Bear me no ill-will at
      parting, sir.&rsquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;I bear,&rsquo; answered Mr Pecksniff, mildly, &lsquo;no ill-will to any man on
      earth.&rsquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;I told you he didn&rsquo;t,&rsquo; said Pinch, in an undertone; &lsquo;I knew he didn&rsquo;t! He
      always says he don&rsquo;t.&rsquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Then you will shake hands, sir?&rsquo; cried Westlock, advancing a step or two,
      and bespeaking Mr Pinch&rsquo;s close attention by a glance.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Umph!&rsquo; said Mr Pecksniff, in his most winning tone.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;You will shake hands, sir.&rsquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;No, John,&rsquo; said Mr Pecksniff, with a calmness quite ethereal; &lsquo;no, I will
      not shake hands, John. I have forgiven you. I had already forgiven you,
      even before you ceased to reproach and taunt me. I have embraced you in
      the spirit, John, which is better than shaking hands.&rsquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Pinch,&rsquo; said the youth, turning towards him, with a hearty disgust of his
      late master, &lsquo;what did I tell you?&rsquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      Poor Pinch looked down uneasily at Mr Pecksniff, whose eye was fixed upon
      him as it had been from the first; and looking up at the ceiling again,
      made no reply.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;As to your forgiveness, Mr Pecksniff,&rsquo; said the youth, &lsquo;I&rsquo;ll not have it
      upon such terms. I won&rsquo;t be forgiven.&rsquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Won&rsquo;t you, John?&rsquo; retorted Mr Pecksniff, with a smile. &lsquo;You must. You
      can&rsquo;t help it. Forgiveness is a high quality; an exalted virtue; far above
      <i>your </i>control or influence, John. I <i>will </i>forgive you. You cannot move me to
      remember any wrong you have ever done me, John.&rsquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Wrong!&rsquo; cried the other, with all the heat and impetuosity of his age.
      &lsquo;Here&rsquo;s a pretty fellow! Wrong! Wrong I have done him! He&rsquo;ll not even
      remember the five hundred pounds he had with me under false pretences; or
      the seventy pounds a year for board and lodging that would have been dear
      at seventeen! Here&rsquo;s a martyr!&rsquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Money, John,&rsquo; said Mr Pecksniff, &lsquo;is the root of all evil. I grieve to
      see that it is already bearing evil fruit in you. But I will not remember
      its existence. I will not even remember the conduct of that misguided
      person&rsquo;&mdash;and here, although he spoke like one at peace with all the
      world, he used an emphasis that plainly said &ldquo;I have my eye upon the
      rascal now&rdquo;&mdash;&lsquo;that misguided person who has brought you here
      to-night, seeking to disturb (it is a happiness to say, in vain) the
      heart&rsquo;s repose and peace of one who would have shed his dearest blood to
      serve him.&rsquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      The voice of Mr Pecksniff trembled as he spoke, and sobs were heard from
      his daughters. Sounds floated on the air, moreover, as if two spirit
      voices had exclaimed: one, &lsquo;Beast!&rsquo; the other, &lsquo;Savage!&rsquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Forgiveness,&rsquo; said Mr Pecksniff, &lsquo;entire and pure forgiveness is not
      incompatible with a wounded heart; perchance when the heart is wounded, it
      becomes a greater virtue. With my breast still wrung and grieved to its
      inmost core by the ingratitude of that person, I am proud and glad to say
      that I forgive him. Nay! I beg,&rsquo; cried Mr Pecksniff, raising his voice, as
      Pinch appeared about to speak, &lsquo;I beg that individual not to offer a
      remark; he will truly oblige me by not uttering one word, just now. I am
      not sure that I am equal to the trial. In a very short space of time, I
      shall have sufficient fortitude, I trust to converse with him as if these
      events had never happened. But not,&rsquo; said Mr Pecksniff, turning round
      again towards the fire, and waving his hand in the direction of the door,
      &lsquo;not now.&rsquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Bah!&rsquo; cried John Westlock, with the utmost disgust and disdain the
      monosyllable is capable of expressing. &lsquo;Ladies, good evening. Come, Pinch,
      it&rsquo;s not worth thinking of. I was right and you were wrong. That&rsquo;s small
      matter; you&rsquo;ll be wiser another time.&rsquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      So saying, he clapped that dejected companion on the shoulder, turned upon
      his heel, and walked out into the passage, whither poor Mr Pinch, after
      lingering irresolutely in the parlour for a few seconds, expressing in his
      countenance the deepest mental misery and gloom followed him. Then they
      took up the box between them, and sallied out to meet the mail.
    </p>
    <p>
      That fleet conveyance passed, every night, the corner of a lane at some
      distance; towards which point they bent their steps. For some minutes they
      walked along in silence, until at length young Westlock burst into a loud
      laugh, and at intervals into another, and another. Still there was no
      response from his companion.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;I&rsquo;ll tell you what, Pinch!&rsquo; he said abruptly, after another lengthened
      silence&mdash;&lsquo;You haven&rsquo;t half enough of the devil in you. Half enough!
      You haven&rsquo;t any.&rsquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Well!&rsquo; said Pinch with a sigh, &lsquo;I don&rsquo;t know, I&rsquo;m sure. It&rsquo;s compliment
      to say so. If I haven&rsquo;t, I suppose, I&rsquo;m all the better for it.&rsquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;All the better!&rsquo; repeated his companion tartly: &lsquo;All the worse, you mean
      to say.&rsquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;And yet,&rsquo; said Pinch, pursuing his own thoughts and not this last remark
      on the part of his friend, &lsquo;I must have a good deal of what you call the
      devil in me, too, or how could I make Pecksniff so uncomfortable? I
      wouldn&rsquo;t have occasioned him so much distress&mdash;don&rsquo;t laugh, please&mdash;for
      a mine of money; and Heaven knows I could find good use for it too, John.
      How grieved he was!&rsquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;<i>He</i> grieved!&rsquo; returned the other.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Why didn&rsquo;t you observe that the tears were almost starting out of his
      eyes!&rsquo; cried Pinch. &lsquo;Bless my soul, John, is it nothing to see a man moved
      to that extent and know one&rsquo;s self to be the cause! And did you hear him
      say that he could have shed his blood for me?&rsquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Do you <i>want </i>any blood shed for you?&rsquo; returned his friend, with
      considerable irritation. &lsquo;Does he shed anything for you that you <i>do</i> want?
      Does he shed employment for you, instruction for you, pocket money for
      you? Does he shed even legs of mutton for you in any decent proportion to
      potatoes and garden stuff?&rsquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;I am afraid,&rsquo; said Pinch, sighing again, &lsquo;that I am a great eater; I
      can&rsquo;t disguise from myself that I&rsquo;m a great eater. Now, you know that,
      John.&rsquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;You a great eater!&rsquo; retorted his companion, with no less indignation than
      before. &lsquo;How do you know you are?&rsquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      There appeared to be forcible matter in this inquiry, for Mr Pinch only
      repeated in an undertone that he had a strong misgiving on the subject,
      and that he greatly feared he was.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Besides, whether I am or no,&rsquo; he added, &lsquo;that has little or nothing to do
      with his thinking me ungrateful. John, there is scarcely a sin in the
      world that is in my eyes such a crying one as ingratitude; and when he
      taxes me with that, and believes me to be guilty of it, he makes me
      miserable and wretched.&rsquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Do you think he don&rsquo;t know that?&rsquo; returned the other scornfully. &lsquo;But
      come, Pinch, before I say anything more to you, just run over the reasons
      you have for being grateful to him at all, will you? Change hands first,
      for the box is heavy. That&rsquo;ll do. Now, go on.&rsquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;In the first place,&rsquo; said Pinch, &lsquo;he took me as his pupil for much less
      than he asked.&rsquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Well,&rsquo; rejoined his friend, perfectly unmoved by this instance of
      generosity. &lsquo;What in the second place?&rsquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;What in the second place?&rsquo; cried Pinch, in a sort of desperation, &lsquo;why,
      everything in the second place. My poor old grandmother died happy to
      think that she had put me with such an excellent man. I have grown up in
      his house, I am in his confidence, I am his assistant, he allows me a
      salary; when his business improves, my prospects are to improve too. All
      this, and a great deal more, is in the second place. And in the very
      prologue and preface to the first place, John, you must consider this,
      which nobody knows better than I: that I was born for much plainer and
      poorer things, that I am not a good hand for his kind of business, and
      have no talent for it, or indeed for anything else but odds and ends that
      are of no use or service to anybody.&rsquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      He said this with so much earnestness, and in a tone so full of feeling,
      that his companion instinctively changed his manner as he sat down on the
      box (they had by this time reached the finger-post at the end of the
      lane); motioned him to sit down beside him; and laid his hand upon his
      shoulder.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;I believe you are one of the best fellows in the world,&rsquo; he said, &lsquo;Tom
      Pinch.&rsquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Not at all,&rsquo; rejoined Tom. &lsquo;If you only knew Pecksniff as well as I do,
      you might say it of him, indeed, and say it truly.&rsquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;I&rsquo;ll say anything of him, you like,&rsquo; returned the other, &lsquo;and not another
      word to his disparagement.&rsquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;It&rsquo;s for my sake, then; not his, I am afraid,&rsquo; said Pinch, shaking his
      head gravely.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;For whose you please, Tom, so that it does please you. Oh! He&rsquo;s a famous
      fellow! <i>he</i> never scraped and clawed into his pouch all your poor
      grandmother&rsquo;s hard savings&mdash;she was a housekeeper, wasn&rsquo;t she, Tom?&rsquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Yes,&rsquo; said Mr Pinch, nursing one of his large knees, and nodding his
      head; &lsquo;a gentleman&rsquo;s housekeeper.&rsquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;<i>He</i> never scraped and clawed into his pouch all her hard savings; dazzling
      her with prospects of your happiness and advancement, which he knew (and
      no man better) never would be realised! <i>He</i> never speculated and traded on
      her pride in you, and her having educated you, and on her desire that you
      at least should live to be a gentleman. Not he, Tom!&rsquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;No,&rsquo; said Tom, looking into his friend&rsquo;s face, as if he were a little
      doubtful of his meaning. &lsquo;Of course not.&rsquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;So I say,&rsquo; returned the youth, &lsquo;of course he never did. <i>He</i> didn&rsquo;t take
      less than he had asked, because that less was all she had, and more than
      he expected; not he, Tom! He doesn&rsquo;t keep you as his assistant because you
      are of any use to him; because your wonderful faith in his pretensions is
      of inestimable service in all his mean disputes; because your honesty
      reflects honesty on him; because your wandering about this little place
      all your spare hours, reading in ancient books and foreign tongues, gets
      noised abroad, even as far as Salisbury, making of him, Pecksniff the
      master, a man of learning and of vast importance. <i>He</i> gets no credit from
      you, Tom, not he.&rsquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Why, of course he don&rsquo;t,&rsquo; said Pinch, gazing at his friend with a more
      troubled aspect than before. &lsquo;Pecksniff get credit from me! Well!&rsquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Don&rsquo;t I say that it&rsquo;s ridiculous,&rsquo; rejoined the other, &lsquo;even to think of
      such a thing?&rsquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Why, it&rsquo;s madness,&rsquo; said Tom.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Madness!&rsquo; returned young Westlock. &lsquo;Certainly it&rsquo;s madness. Who but a
      madman would suppose he cares to hear it said on Sundays, that the
      volunteer who plays the organ in the church, and practises on summer
      evenings in the dark, is Mr Pecksniff&rsquo;s young man, eh, Tom? Who but a
      madman would suppose it is the game of such a man as he, to have his name
      in everybody&rsquo;s mouth, connected with the thousand useless odds and ends
      you do (and which, of course, he taught you), eh, Tom? Who but a madman
      would suppose you advertised him hereabouts, much cheaper and much better
      than a chalker on the walls could, eh, Tom? As well might one suppose that
      he doesn&rsquo;t on all occasions pour out his whole heart and soul to you; that
      he doesn&rsquo;t make you a very liberal and indeed rather an extravagant
      allowance; or, to be more wild and monstrous still, if that be possible,
      as well might one suppose,&rsquo; and here, at every word, he struck him lightly
      on the breast, &lsquo;that Pecksniff traded in your nature, and that your nature
      was to be timid and distrustful of yourself, and trustful of all other
      men, but most of all, of him who least deserves it. There would be
      madness, Tom!&rsquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      Mr Pinch had listened to all this with looks of bewilderment, which seemed
      to be in part occasioned by the matter of his companion&rsquo;s speech, and in
      part by his rapid and vehement manner. Now that he had come to a close, he
      drew a very long breath; and gazing wistfully in his face as if he were
      unable to settle in his own mind what expression it wore, and were
      desirous to draw from it as good a clue to his real meaning as it was
      possible to obtain in the dark, was about to answer, when the sound of the
      mail guard&rsquo;s horn came cheerily upon their ears, putting an immediate end
      to the conference; greatly as it seemed to the satisfaction of the younger
      man, who jumped up briskly, and gave his hand to his companion.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Both hands, Tom. I shall write to you from London, mind!&rsquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Yes,&rsquo; said Pinch. &lsquo;Yes. Do, please. Good-bye. Good-bye. I can hardly
      believe you&rsquo;re going. It seems, now, but yesterday that you came.
      Good-bye! my dear old fellow!&rsquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      John Westlock returned his parting words with no less heartiness of
      manner, and sprung up to his seat upon the roof. Off went the mail at a
      canter down the dark road; the lamps gleaming brightly, and the horn
      awakening all the echoes, far and wide.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Go your ways,&rsquo; said Pinch, apostrophizing the coach; &lsquo;I can hardly
      persuade myself but you&rsquo;re alive, and are some great monster who visits
      this place at certain intervals, to bear my friends away into the world.
      You&rsquo;re more exulting and rampant than usual tonight, I think; and you may
      well crow over your prize; for he is a fine lad, an ingenuous lad, and has
      but one fault that I know of; he don&rsquo;t mean it, but he is most cruelly
      unjust to Pecksniff!&rsquo;

    <h2>
      CHAPTER THREE
    </h2>
    <p>
      IN WHICH CERTAIN OTHER PERSONS ARE INTRODUCED; ON THE SAME TERMS AS IN THE
      LAST CHAPTER
    </p>
    <p>
      Mention has been already made more than once, of a certain Dragon who
      swung and creaked complainingly before the village alehouse door. A faded,
      and an ancient dragon he was; and many a wintry storm of rain, snow,
      sleet, and hail, had changed his colour from a gaudy blue to a faint
      lack-lustre shade of grey. But there he hung; rearing, in a state of
      monstrous imbecility, on his hind legs; waxing, with every month that
      passed, so much more dim and shapeless, that as you gazed at him on one
      side of the sign-board it seemed as if he must be gradually melting
      through it, and coming out upon the other.
    </p>
    <p>
      He was a courteous and considerate dragon, too; or had been in his
      distincter days; for in the midst of his rampant feebleness, he kept one
      of his forepaws near his nose, as though he would say, &lsquo;Don&rsquo;t mind me&mdash;it&rsquo;s
      only my fun;&rsquo; while he held out the other in polite and hospitable
      entreaty. Indeed it must be conceded to the whole brood of dragons of
      modern times, that they have made a great advance in civilisation and
      refinement. They no longer demand a beautiful virgin for breakfast every
      morning, with as much regularity as any tame single gentleman expects his
      hot roll, but rest content with the society of idle bachelors and roving
      married men; and they are now remarkable rather for holding aloof from the
      softer sex and discouraging their visits (especially on Saturday nights),
      than for rudely insisting on their company without any reference to their
      inclinations, as they are known to have done in days of yore.
    </p>
    <p>
      Nor is this tribute to the reclaimed animals in question so wide a
      digression into the realms of Natural History as it may, at first sight,
      appear to be; for the present business of these pages in with the dragon
      who had his retreat in Mr Pecksniff&rsquo;s neighbourhood, and that courteous
      animal being already on the carpet, there is nothing in the way of its
      immediate transaction.
    </p>
    <p>
      For many years, then, he had swung and creaked, and flapped himself about,
      before the two windows of the best bedroom of that house of entertainment
      to which he lent his name; but never in all his swinging, creaking, and
      flapping, had there been such a stir within its dingy precincts, as on the
      evening next after that upon which the incidents, detailed in the last
      chapter occurred; when there was such a hurrying up and down stairs of
      feet, such a glancing of lights, such a whispering of voices, such a
      smoking and sputtering of wood newly lighted in a damp chimney, such an
      airing of linen, such a scorching smell of hot warming-pans, such a
      domestic bustle and to-do, in short, as never dragon, griffin, unicorn, or
      other animal of that species presided over, since they first began to
      interest themselves in household affairs.
    </p>
    <p>
      An old gentleman and a young lady, travelling, unattended, in a rusty old
      chariot with post-horses; coming nobody knew whence and going nobody knew
      whither; had turned out of the high road, and driven unexpectedly to the
      Blue Dragon; and here was the old gentleman, who had taken this step by
      reason of his sudden illness in the carriage, suffering the most horrible
      cramps and spasms, yet protesting and vowing in the very midst of his
      pain, that he wouldn&rsquo;t have a doctor sent for, and wouldn&rsquo;t take any
      remedies but those which the young lady administered from a small
      medicine-chest, and wouldn&rsquo;t, in a word, do anything but terrify the
      landlady out of her five wits, and obstinately refuse compliance with
      every suggestion that was made to him.
    </p>
    <p>
      Of all the five hundred proposals for his relief which the good woman
      poured out in less than half an hour, he would entertain but one. That was
      that he should go to bed. And it was in the preparation of his bed and the
      arrangement of his chamber, that all the stir was made in the room behind
      the Dragon.
    </p>
    <p>
      He was, beyond all question, very ill, and suffered exceedingly; not the
      less, perhaps, because he was a strong and vigorous old man, with a will
      of iron, and a voice of brass. But neither the apprehensions which he
      plainly entertained, at times, for his life, nor the great pain he
      underwent, influenced his resolution in the least degree. He would have no
      person sent for. The worse he grew, the more rigid and inflexible he
      became in his determination. If they sent for any person to attend him,
      man, woman, or child, he would leave the house directly (so he told them),
      though he quitted it on foot, and died upon the threshold of the door.
    </p>
    <p>
      Now, there being no medical practitioner actually resident in the village,
      but a poor apothecary who was also a grocer and general dealer, the
      landlady had, upon her own responsibility, sent for him, in the very first
      burst and outset of the disaster. Of course it followed, as a necessary
      result of his being wanted, that he was not at home. He had gone some
      miles away, and was not expected home until late at night; so the
      landlady, being by this time pretty well beside herself, dispatched the
      same messenger in all haste for Mr Pecksniff, as a learned man who could
      bear a deal of responsibility, and a moral man who could administer a
      world of comfort to a troubled mind. That her guest had need of some
      efficient services under the latter head was obvious enough from the
      restless expressions, importing, however, rather a worldly than a
      spiritual anxiety, to which he gave frequent utterance.
    </p>
    <p>
      From this last-mentioned secret errand, the messenger returned with no
      better news than from the first; Mr Pecksniff was not at home. However,
      they got the patient into bed without him; and in the course of two hours,
      he gradually became so far better that there were much longer intervals
      than at first between his terms of suffering. By degrees, he ceased to
      suffer at all; though his exhaustion was occasionally so great that it
      suggested hardly less alarm than his actual endurance had done.
    </p>
    <p>
      It was in one of his intervals of repose, when, looking round with great
      caution, and reaching uneasily out of his nest of pillows, he endeavoured,
      with a strange air of secrecy and distrust, to make use of the writing
      materials which he had ordered to be placed on a table beside him, that
      the young lady and the mistress of the Blue Dragon found themselves
      sitting side by side before the fire in the sick chamber.
    </p>
    <p>
      The mistress of the Blue Dragon was in outward appearance just what a
      landlady should be: broad, buxom, comfortable, and good looking, with a
      face of clear red and white, which, by its jovial aspect, at once bore
      testimony to her hearty participation in the good things of the larder and
      cellar, and to their thriving and healthful influences. She was a widow,
      but years ago had passed through her state of weeds, and burst into flower
      again; and in full bloom she had continued ever since; and in full bloom
      she was now; with roses on her ample skirts, and roses on her bodice,
      roses in her cap, roses in her cheeks,&mdash;aye, and roses, worth the
      gathering too, on her lips, for that matter. She had still a bright black
      eye, and jet black hair; was comely, dimpled, plump, and tight as a
      gooseberry; and though she was not exactly what the world calls young, you
      may make an affidavit, on trust, before any mayor or magistrate in
      Christendom, that there are a great many young ladies in the world
      (blessings on them one and all!) whom you wouldn&rsquo;t like half as well, or
      admire half as much, as the beaming hostess of the Blue Dragon.
    </p>
    <p>
      As this fair matron sat beside the fire, she glanced occasionally with all
      the pride of ownership, about the room; which was a large apartment, such
      as one may see in country places, with a low roof and a sunken flooring,
      all downhill from the door, and a descent of two steps on the inside so
      exquisitely unexpected, that strangers, despite the most elaborate
      cautioning, usually dived in head first, as into a plunging-bath. It was
      none of your frivolous and preposterously bright bedrooms, where nobody
      can close an eye with any kind of propriety or decent regard to the
      association of ideas; but it was a good, dull, leaden, drowsy place, where
      every article of furniture reminded you that you came there to sleep, and
      that you were expected to go to sleep. There was no wakeful reflection of
      the fire there, as in your modern chambers, which upon the darkest nights
      have a watchful consciousness of French polish; the old Spanish mahogany
      winked at it now and then, as a dozing cat or dog might, nothing more. The
      very size and shape, and hopeless immovability of the bedstead, and
      wardrobe, and in a minor degree of even the chairs and tables, provoked
      sleep; they were plainly apoplectic and disposed to snore. There were no
      staring portraits to remonstrate with you for being lazy; no round-eyed
      birds upon the curtains, disgustingly wide awake, and insufferably prying.
      The thick neutral hangings, and the dark blinds, and the heavy heap of
      bed-clothes, were all designed to hold in sleep, and act as nonconductors
      to the day and getting up. Even the old stuffed fox upon the top of the
      wardrobe was devoid of any spark of vigilance, for his glass eye had
      fallen out, and he slumbered as he stood.
    </p>
    <p>
      The wandering attention of the mistress of the Blue Dragon roved to these
      things but twice or thrice, and then for but an instant at a time. It soon
      deserted them, and even the distant bed with its strange burden, for the
      young creature immediately before her, who, with her downcast eyes
      intently fixed upon the fire, sat wrapped in silent meditation.
    </p>
    <p>
      She was very young; apparently no more than seventeen; timid and shrinking
      in her manner, and yet with a greater share of self possession and control
      over her emotions than usually belongs to a far more advanced period of
      female life. This she had abundantly shown, but now, in her tending of the
      sick gentleman. She was short in stature; and her figure was slight, as
      became her years; but all the charms of youth and maidenhood set it off,
      and clustered on her gentle brow. Her face was very pale, in part no doubt
      from recent agitation. Her dark brown hair, disordered from the same
      cause, had fallen negligently from its bonds, and hung upon her neck; for
      which instance of its waywardness no male observer would have had the
      heart to blame it.
    </p>
    <p>
      Her attire was that of a lady, but extremely plain; and in her manner,
      even when she sat as still as she did then, there was an indefinable
      something which appeared to be in kindred with her scrupulously
      unpretending dress. She had sat, at first looking anxiously towards the
      bed; but seeing that the patient remained quiet, and was busy with his
      writing, she had softly moved her chair into its present place; partly, as
      it seemed, from an instinctive consciousness that he desired to avoid
      observation; and partly that she might, unseen by him, give some vent to
      the natural feelings she had hitherto suppressed.
    </p>
    <p>
      Of all this, and much more, the rosy landlady of the Blue Dragon took as
      accurate note and observation as only woman can take of woman. And at
      length she said, in a voice too low, she knew, to reach the bed:
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;You have seen the gentleman in this way before, miss? Is he used to these
      attacks?&rsquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;I have seen him very ill before, but not so ill as he has been tonight.&rsquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;What a Providence!&rsquo; said the landlady of the Dragon, &lsquo;that you had the
      prescriptions and the medicines with you, miss!&rsquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;They are intended for such an emergency. We never travel without them.&rsquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Oh!&rsquo; thought the hostess, &lsquo;then we are in the habit of travelling, and of
      travelling together.&rsquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      She was so conscious of expressing this in her face, that meeting the
      young lady&rsquo;s eyes immediately afterwards, and being a very honest hostess,
      she was rather confused.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;The gentleman&mdash;your grandpapa&rsquo;&mdash;she resumed, after a short
      pause, &lsquo;being so bent on having no assistance, must terrify you very much,
      miss?&rsquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;I have been very much alarmed to-night. He&mdash;he is not my
      grandfather.&rsquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Father, I should have said,&rsquo; returned the hostess, sensible of having
      made an awkward mistake.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Nor my father&rsquo; said the young lady. &lsquo;Nor,&rsquo; she added, slightly smiling
      with a quick perception of what the landlady was going to add, &lsquo;Nor my
      uncle. We are not related.&rsquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Oh dear me!&rsquo; returned the landlady, still more embarrassed than before;
      &lsquo;how could I be so very much mistaken; knowing, as anybody in their proper
      senses might that when a gentleman is ill, he looks so much older than he
      really is? That I should have called you &ldquo;Miss,&rdquo; too, ma&rsquo;am!&rsquo; But when she
      had proceeded thus far, she glanced involuntarily at the third finger of
      the young lady&rsquo;s left hand, and faltered again; for there was no ring upon
      it.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;When I told you we were not related,&rsquo; said the other mildly, but not
      without confusion on her own part, &lsquo;I meant not in any way. Not even by
      marriage. Did you call me, Martin?&rsquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Call you?&rsquo; cried the old man, looking quickly up, and hurriedly drawing
      beneath the coverlet the paper on which he had been writing. &lsquo;No.&rsquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      She had moved a pace or two towards the bed, but stopped immediately, and
      went no farther.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;No,&rsquo; he repeated, with a petulant emphasis. &lsquo;Why do you ask me? If I had
      called you, what need for such a question?&rsquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;It was the creaking of the sign outside, sir, I dare say,&rsquo; observed the
      landlady; a suggestion by the way (as she felt a moment after she had made
      it), not at all complimentary to the voice of the old gentleman.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;No matter what, ma&rsquo;am,&rsquo; he rejoined: &lsquo;it wasn&rsquo;t I. Why how you stand
      there, Mary, as if I had the plague! But they&rsquo;re all afraid of me,&rsquo; he
      added, leaning helplessly backward on his pillow; &lsquo;even she! There is a
      curse upon me. What else have I to look for?&rsquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Oh dear, no. Oh no, I&rsquo;m sure,&rsquo; said the good-tempered landlady, rising,
      and going towards him. &lsquo;Be of better cheer, sir. These are only sick
      fancies.&rsquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;What are only sick fancies?&rsquo; he retorted. &lsquo;What do you know about
      fancies? Who told you about fancies? The old story! Fancies!&rsquo;
    </p>

    </h5>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Only see again there, how you take one up!&rsquo; said the mistress of the Blue
      Dragon, with unimpaired good humour. &lsquo;Dear heart alive, there is no harm
      in the word, sir, if it is an old one. Folks in good health have their
      fancies, too, and strange ones, every day.&rsquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      Harmless as this speech appeared to be, it acted on the traveller&rsquo;s
      distrust, like oil on fire. He raised his head up in the bed, and, fixing
      on her two dark eyes whose brightness was exaggerated by the paleness of
      his hollow cheeks, as they in turn, together with his straggling locks of
      long grey hair, were rendered whiter by the tight black velvet skullcap
      which he wore, he searched her face intently.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Ah! you begin too soon,&rsquo; he said, in so low a voice that he seemed to be
      thinking it, rather than addressing her. &lsquo;But you lose no time. You do
      your errand, and you earn your fee. Now, who may be your client?&rsquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      The landlady looked in great astonishment at her whom he called Mary, and
      finding no rejoinder in the drooping face, looked back again at him. At
      first she had recoiled involuntarily, supposing him disordered in his
      mind; but the slow composure of his manner, and the settled purpose
      announced in his strong features, and gathering, most of all, about his
      puckered mouth, forbade the supposition.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Come,&rsquo; he said, &lsquo;tell me who is it? Being here, it is not very hard for
      me to guess, you may suppose.&rsquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Martin,&rsquo; interposed the young lady, laying her hand upon his arm;
      &lsquo;reflect how short a time we have been in this house, and that even your
      name is unknown here.&rsquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Unless,&rsquo; he said, &lsquo;you&mdash;&rsquo; He was evidently tempted to express a
      suspicion of her having broken his confidence in favour of the landlady,
      but either remembering her tender nursing, or being moved in some sort by
      her face, he checked himself, and changing his uneasy posture in the bed,
      was silent.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;There!&rsquo; said Mrs Lupin; for in that name the Blue Dragon was licensed to
      furnish entertainment, both to man and beast. &lsquo;Now, you will be well
      again, sir. You forgot, for the moment, that there were none but friends
      here.&rsquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Oh!&rsquo; cried the old man, moaning impatiently, as he tossed one restless
      arm upon the coverlet; &lsquo;why do you talk to me of friends! Can you or
      anybody teach me to know who are my friends, and who my enemies?&rsquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;At least,&rsquo; urged Mrs Lupin, gently, &lsquo;this young lady is your friend, I am
      sure.&rsquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;She has no temptation to be otherwise,&rsquo; cried the old man, like one whose
      hope and confidence were utterly exhausted. &lsquo;I suppose she is. Heaven
      knows. There, let me try to sleep. Leave the candle where it is.&rsquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      As they retired from the bed, he drew forth the writing which had occupied
      him so long, and holding it in the flame of the taper burnt it to ashes.
      That done, he extinguished the light, and turning his face away with a
      heavy sigh, drew the coverlet about his head, and lay quite still.
    </p>
    <p>
      This destruction of the paper, both as being strangely inconsistent with
      the labour he had devoted to it, and as involving considerable danger of
      fire to the Dragon, occasioned Mrs Lupin not a little consternation. But
      the young lady evincing no surprise, curiosity, or alarm, whispered her,
      with many thanks for her solicitude and company, that she would remain
      there some time longer; and that she begged her not to share her watch, as
      she was well used to being alone, and would pass the time in reading.
    </p>
    <p>
      Mrs Lupin had her full share and dividend of that large capital of
      curiosity which is inherited by her sex, and at another time it might have
      been difficult so to impress this hint upon her as to induce her to take
      it. But now, in sheer wonder and amazement at these mysteries, she
      withdrew at once, and repairing straightway to her own little parlour
      below stairs, sat down in her easy-chair with unnatural composure. At this
      very crisis, a step was heard in the entry, and Mr Pecksniff, looking
      sweetly over the half-door of the bar, and into the vista of snug privacy
      beyond, murmured:
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Good evening, Mrs Lupin!&rsquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Oh dear me, sir!&rsquo; she cried, advancing to receive him, &lsquo;I am so very glad
      you have come.&rsquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;And I am very glad I have come,&rsquo; said Mr Pecksniff, &lsquo;if I can be of
      service. I am very glad I have come. What is the matter, Mrs Lupin?&rsquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;A gentleman taken ill upon the road, has been so very bad upstairs, sir,&rsquo;
      said the tearful hostess.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;A gentleman taken ill upon the road, has been so very bad upstairs, has
      he?&rsquo; repeated Mr Pecksniff. &lsquo;Well, well!&rsquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      Now there was nothing that one may call decidedly original in this remark,
      nor can it be exactly said to have contained any wise precept theretofore
      unknown to mankind, or to have opened any hidden source of consolation;
      but Mr Pecksniff&rsquo;s manner was so bland, and he nodded his head so
      soothingly, and showed in everything such an affable sense of his own
      excellence, that anybody would have been, as Mrs Lupin was, comforted by
      the mere voice and presence of such a man; and, though he had merely said
      &lsquo;a verb must agree with its nominative case in number and person, my good
      friend,&rsquo; or &lsquo;eight times eight are sixty-four, my worthy soul,&rsquo; must have
      felt deeply grateful to him for his humanity and wisdom.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;And how,&rsquo; asked Mr Pecksniff, drawing off his gloves and warming his
      hands before the fire, as benevolently as if they were somebody else&rsquo;s,
      not his; &lsquo;and how is he now?&rsquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;He is better, and quite tranquil,&rsquo; answered Mrs Lupin.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;He is better, and quite tranquil,&rsquo; said Mr Pecksniff. &lsquo;Very well! Ve-ry
      well!&rsquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      Here again, though the statement was Mrs Lupin&rsquo;s and not Mr Pecksniff&rsquo;s,
      Mr Pecksniff made it his own and consoled her with it. It was not much
      when Mrs Lupin said it, but it was a whole book when Mr Pecksniff said it.
      &lsquo;I observe,&rsquo; he seemed to say, &lsquo;and through me, morality in general
      remarks, that he is better and quite tranquil.&rsquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;There must be weighty matters on his mind, though,&rsquo; said the hostess,
      shaking her head, &lsquo;for he talks, sir, in the strangest way you ever heard.
      He is far from easy in his thoughts, and wants some proper advice from
      those whose goodness makes it worth his having.&rsquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Then,&rsquo; said Mr Pecksniff, &lsquo;he is the sort of customer for me.&rsquo; But though
      he said this in the plainest language, he didn&rsquo;t speak a word. He only
      shook his head; disparagingly of himself too.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;I am afraid, sir,&rsquo; continued the landlady, first looking round to assure
      herself that there was nobody within hearing, and then looking down upon
      the floor. &lsquo;I am very much afraid, sir, that his conscience is troubled by
      his not being related to&mdash;or&mdash;or even married to&mdash;a very
      young lady&mdash;&rsquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Mrs Lupin!&rsquo; said Mr Pecksniff, holding up his hand with something in his
      manner as nearly approaching to severity as any expression of his, mild
      being that he was, could ever do. &lsquo;Person! young person?&rsquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;A very young person,&rsquo; said Mrs Lupin, curtseying and blushing; &lsquo;&mdash;I
      beg your pardon, sir, but I have been so hurried to-night, that I don&rsquo;t
      know what I say&mdash;who is with him now.&rsquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Who is with him now,&rsquo; ruminated Mr Pecksniff, warming his back (as he had
      warmed his hands) as if it were a widow&rsquo;s back, or an orphan&rsquo;s back, or an
      enemy&rsquo;s back, or a back that any less excellent man would have suffered to
      be cold. &lsquo;Oh dear me, dear me!&rsquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;At the same time I am bound to say, and I do say with all my heart,&rsquo;
      observed the hostess, earnestly, &lsquo;that her looks and manner almost disarm
      suspicion.&rsquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Your suspicion, Mrs Lupin,&rsquo; said Mr Pecksniff gravely, &lsquo;is very natural.&rsquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      Touching which remark, let it be written down to their confusion, that the
      enemies of this worthy man unblushingly maintained that he always said of
      what was very bad, that it was very natural; and that he unconsciously
      betrayed his own nature in doing so.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Your suspicion, Mrs Lupin,&rsquo; he repeated, &lsquo;is very natural, and I have no
      doubt correct. I will wait upon these travellers.&rsquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      With that he took off his great-coat, and having run his fingers through
      his hair, thrust one hand gently in the bosom of his waist-coat and meekly
      signed to her to lead the way.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Shall I knock?&rsquo; asked Mrs Lupin, when they reached the chamber door.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;No,&rsquo; said Mr Pecksniff, &lsquo;enter if you please.&rsquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      They went in on tiptoe; or rather the hostess took that precaution for Mr
      Pecksniff always walked softly. The old gentleman was still asleep, and
      his young companion still sat reading by the fire.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;I am afraid,&rsquo; said Mr Pecksniff, pausing at the door, and giving his head
      a melancholy roll, &lsquo;I am afraid that this looks artful. I am afraid, Mrs
      Lupin, do you know, that this looks very artful!&rsquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      As he finished this whisper, he advanced before the hostess; and at the
      same time the young lady, hearing footsteps, rose. Mr Pecksniff glanced at
      the volume she held, and whispered Mrs Lupin again; if possible, with
      increased despondency.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Yes, ma&rsquo;am,&rsquo; he said, &lsquo;it is a good book. I was fearful of that
      beforehand. I am apprehensive that this is a very deep thing indeed!&rsquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;What gentleman is this?&rsquo; inquired the object of his virtuous doubts.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Hush! don&rsquo;t trouble yourself, ma&rsquo;am,&rsquo; said Mr Pecksniff, as the landlady
      was about to answer. &lsquo;This young&rsquo;&mdash;in spite of himself he hesitated
      when &ldquo;person&rdquo; rose to his lips, and substituted another word: &lsquo;this young
      stranger, Mrs Lupin, will excuse me for replying briefly, that I reside in
      this village; it may be in an influential manner, however, undeserved; and
      that I have been summoned here by you. I am here, as I am everywhere, I
      hope, in sympathy for the sick and sorry.&rsquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      With these impressive words, Mr Pecksniff passed over to the bedside,
      where, after patting the counterpane once or twice in a very solemn
      manner, as if by that means he gained a clear insight into the patient&rsquo;s
      disorder, he took his seat in a large arm-chair, and in an attitude of
      some thoughtfulness and much comfort, waited for his waking. Whatever
      objection the young lady urged to Mrs Lupin went no further, for nothing
      more was said to Mr Pecksniff, and Mr Pecksniff said nothing more to
      anybody else.
    </p>
    <p>
      Full half an hour elapsed before the old man stirred, but at length he
      turned himself in bed, and, though not yet awake, gave tokens that his
      sleep was drawing to an end. By little and little he removed the
      bed-clothes from about his head, and turned still more towards the side
      where Mr Pecksniff sat. In course of time his eyes opened; and he lay for
      a few moments as people newly roused sometimes will, gazing indolently at
      his visitor, without any distinct consciousness of his presence.
    </p>
    <p>
      There was nothing remarkable in these proceedings, except the influence
      they worked on Mr Pecksniff, which could hardly have been surpassed by the
      most marvellous of natural phenomena. Gradually his hands became tightly
      clasped upon the elbows of the chair, his eyes dilated with surprise, his
      mouth opened, his hair stood more erect upon his forehead than its custom
      was, until, at length, when the old man rose in bed, and stared at him
      with scarcely less emotion than he showed himself, the Pecksniff doubts
      were all resolved, and he exclaimed aloud:
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;You <i>are </i>Martin Chuzzlewit!&rsquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      His consternation of surprise was so genuine, that the old man, with all
      the disposition that he clearly entertained to believe it assumed, was
      convinced of its reality.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;I am Martin Chuzzlewit,&rsquo; he said, bitterly: &lsquo;and Martin Chuzzlewit wishes
      you had been hanged, before you had come here to disturb him in his sleep.
      Why, I dreamed of this fellow!&rsquo; he said, lying down again, and turning
      away his face, &lsquo;before I knew that he was near me!&rsquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;My good cousin&mdash;&rsquo; said Mr Pecksniff.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;There! His very first words!&rsquo; cried the old man, shaking his grey head to
      and fro upon the pillow, and throwing up his hands. &lsquo;In his very first
      words he asserts his relationship! I knew he would; they all do it! Near
      or distant, blood or water, it&rsquo;s all one. Ugh! What a calendar of deceit,
      and lying, and false-witnessing, the sound of any word of kindred opens
      before me!&rsquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Pray do not be hasty, Mr Chuzzlewit,&rsquo; said Pecksniff, in a tone that was
      at once in the sublimest degree compassionate and dispassionate; for he
      had by this time recovered from his surprise, and was in full possession
      of his virtuous self. &lsquo;You will regret being hasty, I know you will.&rsquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;You know!&rsquo; said Martin, contemptuously.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Yes,&rsquo; retorted Mr Pecksniff. &lsquo;Aye, aye, Mr Chuzzlewit; and don&rsquo;t imagine
      that I mean to court or flatter you; for nothing is further from my
      intention. Neither, sir, need you entertain the least misgiving that I
      shall repeat that obnoxious word which has given you so much offence
      already. Why should I? What do I expect or want from you? There is nothing
      in your possession that I know of, Mr Chuzzlewit, which is much to be
      coveted for the happiness it brings you.&rsquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;That&rsquo;s true enough,&rsquo; muttered the old man.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Apart from that consideration,&rsquo; said Mr Pecksniff, watchful of the effect
      he made, &lsquo;it must be plain to you (I am sure) by this time, that if I had
      wished to insinuate myself into your good opinion, I should have been, of
      all things, careful not to address you as a relative; knowing your humour,
      and being quite certain beforehand that I could not have a worse letter of
      recommendation.&rsquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      Martin made not any verbal answer; but he as clearly implied though only
      by a motion of his legs beneath the bed-clothes, that there was reason in
      this, and that he could not dispute it, as if he had said as much in good
      set terms.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;No,&rsquo; said Mr Pecksniff, keeping his hand in his waistcoat as though he
      were ready, on the shortest notice, to produce his heart for Martin
      Chuzzlewit&rsquo;s inspection, &lsquo;I came here to offer my services to a stranger.
      I make no offer of them to you, because I know you would distrust me if I
      did. But lying on that bed, sir, I regard you as a stranger, and I have
      just that amount of interest in you which I hope I should feel in any
      stranger, circumstanced as you are. Beyond that, I am quite as indifferent
      to you, Mr Chuzzlewit, as you are to me.&rsquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      Having said which, Mr Pecksniff threw himself back in the easy-chair; so
      radiant with ingenuous honesty, that Mrs Lupin almost wondered not to see
      a stained-glass Glory, such as the Saint wore in the church, shining about
      his head.
    </p>
    <p>
      A long pause succeeded. The old man, with increased restlessness, changed
      his posture several times. Mrs Lupin and the young lady gazed in silence
      at the counterpane. Mr Pecksniff toyed abstractedly with his eye-glass,
      and kept his eyes shut, that he might ruminate the better.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Eh?&rsquo; he said at last, opening them suddenly, and looking towards the bed.
      &lsquo;I beg your pardon. I thought you spoke. Mrs Lupin,&rsquo; he continued, slowly
      rising &lsquo;I am not aware that I can be of any service to you here. The
      gentleman is better, and you are as good a nurse as he can have. Eh?&rsquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      This last note of interrogation bore reference to another change of
      posture on the old man&rsquo;s part, which brought his face towards Mr Pecksniff
      for the first time since he had turned away from him.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;If you desire to speak to me before I go, sir,&rsquo; continued that gentleman,
      after another pause, &lsquo;you may command my leisure; but I must stipulate, in
      justice to myself, that you do so as to a stranger, strictly as to a
      stranger.&rsquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      Now if Mr Pecksniff knew, from anything Martin Chuzzlewit had expressed in
      gestures, that he wanted to speak to him, he could only have found it out
      on some such principle as prevails in melodramas, and in virtue of which
      the elderly farmer with the comic son always knows what the dumb girl
      means when she takes refuge in his garden, and relates her personal
      memoirs in incomprehensible pantomime. But without stopping to make any
      inquiry on this point, Martin Chuzzlewit signed to his young companion to
      withdraw, which she immediately did, along with the landlady leaving him
      and Mr Pecksniff alone together. For some time they looked at each other
      in silence; or rather the old man looked at Mr Pecksniff, and Mr Pecksniff
      again closing his eyes on all outward objects, took an inward survey of
      his own breast. That it amply repaid him for his trouble, and afforded a
      delicious and enchanting prospect, was clear from the expression of his
      face.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;You wish me to speak to you as to a total stranger,&rsquo; said the old man,
      &lsquo;do you?&rsquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      Mr Pecksniff replied, by a shrug of his shoulders and an apparent turning
      round of his eyes in their sockets before he opened them, that he was
      still reduced to the necessity of entertaining that desire.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;You shall be gratified,&rsquo; said Martin. &lsquo;Sir, I am a rich man. Not so rich
      as some suppose, perhaps, but yet wealthy. I am not a miser sir, though
      even that charge is made against me, as I hear, and currently believed. I
      have no pleasure in hoarding. I have no pleasure in the possession of
      money, The devil that we call by that name can give me nothing but
      unhappiness.&rsquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      It would be no description of Mr Pecksniff&rsquo;s gentleness of manner to adopt
      the common parlance, and say that he looked at this moment as if butter
      wouldn&rsquo;t melt in his mouth. He rather looked as if any quantity of butter
      might have been made out of him, by churning the milk of human kindness,
      as it spouted upwards from his heart.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;For the same reason that I am not a hoarder of money,&rsquo; said the old man,
      &lsquo;I am not lavish of it. Some people find their gratification in storing it
      up; and others theirs in parting with it; but I have no gratification
      connected with the thing. Pain and bitterness are the only goods it ever
      could procure for me. I hate it. It is a spectre walking before me through
      the world, and making every social pleasure hideous.&rsquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      A thought arose in Pecksniff&rsquo;s mind, which must have instantly mounted to
      his face, or Martin Chuzzlewit would not have resumed as quickly and as
      sternly as he did:
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;You would advise me for my peace of mind, to get rid of this source of
      misery, and transfer it to some one who could bear it better. Even you,
      perhaps, would rid me of a burden under which I suffer so grievously. But,
      kind stranger,&rsquo; said the old man, whose every feature darkened as he
      spoke, &lsquo;good Christian stranger, that is a main part of my trouble. In
      other hands, I have known money do good; in other hands I have known it
      triumphed in, and boasted of with reason, as the master-key to all the
      brazen gates that close upon the paths to worldly honour, fortune, and
      enjoyment. To what man or woman; to what worthy, honest, incorruptible
      creature; shall I confide such a talisman, either now or when I die? Do
      you know any such person? <i>your </i>virtues are of course inestimable, but can
      you tell me of any other living creature who will bear the test of contact
      with myself?&rsquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Of contact with yourself, sir?&rsquo; echoed Mr Pecksniff.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Aye,&rsquo; returned the old man, &lsquo;the test of contact with me&mdash;with me.
      You have heard of him whose misery (the gratification of his own foolish
      wish) was, that he turned every thing he touched into gold. The curse of
      my existence, and the realisation of my own mad desire is that by the
      golden standard which I bear about me, I am doomed to try the metal of all
      other men, and find it false and hollow.&rsquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      Mr Pecksniff shook his head, and said, &lsquo;You think so.&rsquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Oh yes,&rsquo; cried the old man, &lsquo;I think so! and in your telling me &ldquo;I think
      so,&rdquo; I recognize the true unworldly ring of <i>your </i>metal. I tell you, man,&rsquo;
      he added, with increasing bitterness, &lsquo;that I have gone, a rich man, among
      people of all grades and kinds; relatives, friends, and strangers; among
      people in whom, when I was poor, I had confidence, and justly, for they
      never once deceived me then, or, to me, wronged each other. But I have
      never found one nature, no, not one, in which, being wealthy and alone, I
      was not forced to detect the latent corruption that lay hid within it
      waiting for such as I to bring it forth. Treachery, deceit, and low
      design; hatred of competitors, real or fancied, for my favour; meanness,
      falsehood, baseness, and servility; or,&rsquo; and here he looked closely in his
      cousin&rsquo;s eyes, &lsquo;or an assumption of honest independence, almost worse than
      all; these are the beauties which my wealth has brought to light. Brother
      against brother, child against parent, friends treading on the faces of
      friends, this is the social company by whom my way has been attended.
      There are stories told&mdash;they may be true or false&mdash;of rich men
      who, in the garb of poverty, have found out virtue and rewarded it. They
      were dolts and idiots for their pains. They should have made the search in
      their own characters. They should have shown themselves fit objects to be
      robbed and preyed upon and plotted against and adulated by any knaves,
      who, but for joy, would have spat upon their coffins when they died their
      dupes; and then their search would have ended as mine has done, and they
      would be what I am.&rsquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      Mr Pecksniff, not at all knowing what it might be best to say in the
      momentary pause which ensued upon these remarks, made an elaborate
      demonstration of intending to deliver something very oracular indeed;
      trusting to the certainty of the old man interrupting him, before he
      should utter a word. Nor was he mistaken, for Martin Chuzzlewit having
      taken breath, went on to say:
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Hear me to an end; judge what profit you are like to gain from any
      repetition of this visit; and leave me. I have so corrupted and changed
      the nature of all those who have ever attended on me, by breeding
      avaricious plots and hopes within them; I have engendered such domestic
      strife and discord, by tarrying even with members of my own family; I have
      been such a lighted torch in peaceful homes, kindling up all the
      inflammable gases and vapours in their moral atmosphere, which, but for
      me, might have proved harmless to the end, that I have, I may say, fled
      from all who knew me, and taking refuge in secret places have lived, of
      late, the life of one who is hunted. The young girl whom you just now saw&mdash;what!
      your eye lightens when I talk of her! You hate her already, do you?&rsquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Upon my word, sir!&rsquo; said Mr Pecksniff, laying his hand upon his breast,
      and dropping his eyelids.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;I forgot,&rsquo; cried the old man, looking at him with a keenness which the
      other seemed to feel, although he did not raise his eyes so as to see it.
      &lsquo;I ask your pardon. I forgot you were a stranger. For the moment you
      reminded me of one Pecksniff, a cousin of mine. As I was saying&mdash;the
      young girl whom you just now saw, is an orphan child, whom, with one
      steady purpose, I have bred and educated, or, if you prefer the word,
      adopted. For a year or more she has been my constant companion, and she is
      my only one. I have taken, as she knows, a solemn oath never to leave her
      sixpence when I die, but while I live I make her an annual allowance; not
      extravagant in its amount and yet not stinted. There is a compact between
      us that no term of affectionate cajolery shall ever be addressed by either
      to the other, but that she shall call me always by my Christian name; I
      her, by hers. She is bound to me in life by ties of interest, and losing
      by my death, and having no expectation disappointed, will mourn it,
      perhaps; though for that I care little. This is the only kind of friend I
      have or will have. Judge from such premises what a profitable hour you
      have spent in coming here, and leave me, to return no more.&rsquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      With these words, the old man fell slowly back upon his pillow. Mr
      Pecksniff as slowly rose, and, with a prefatory hem, began as follows:
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Mr Chuzzlewit.&rsquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;There. Go!&rsquo; interposed the other. &lsquo;Enough of this. I am weary of you.&rsquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;I am sorry for that, sir,&rsquo; rejoined Mr Pecksniff, &lsquo;because I have a duty
      to discharge, from which, depend upon it, I shall not shrink. No, sir, I
      shall not shrink.&rsquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      It is a lamentable fact, that as Mr Pecksniff stood erect beside the bed,
      in all the dignity of Goodness, and addressed him thus, the old man cast
      an angry glance towards the candlestick, as if he were possessed by a
      strong inclination to launch it at his cousin&rsquo;s head. But he constrained
      himself, and pointing with his finger to the door, informed him that his
      road lay there.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Thank you,&rsquo; said Mr Pecksniff; &lsquo;I am aware of that. I am going. But
      before I go, I crave your leave to speak, and more than that, Mr
      Chuzzlewit, I must and will&mdash;yes indeed, I repeat it, must and will&mdash;be
      heard. I am not surprised, sir, at anything you have told me tonight. It
      is natural, very natural, and the greater part of it was known to me
      before. I will not say,&rsquo; continued Mr Pecksniff, drawing out his
      pocket-handkerchief, and winking with both eyes at once, as it were,
      against his will, &lsquo;I will not say that you are mistaken in me. While you
      are in your present mood I would not say so for the world. I almost wish,
      indeed, that I had a different nature, that I might repress even this
      slight confession of weakness; which I cannot disguise from you; which I
      feel is humiliating; but which you will have the goodness to excuse. We
      will say, if you please,&rsquo; added Mr Pecksniff, with great tenderness of
      manner, &lsquo;that it arises from a cold in the head, or is attributable to
      snuff, or smelling-salts, or onions, or anything but the real cause.&rsquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      Here he paused for an instant, and concealed his face behind his
      pocket-handkerchief. Then, smiling faintly, and holding the bed furniture
      with one hand, he resumed:
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;But, Mr Chuzzlewit, while I am forgetful of myself, I owe it to myself,
      and to my character&mdash;aye, sir, and I <i>have </i>a character which is very
      dear to me, and will be the best inheritance of my two daughters&mdash;to
      tell you, on behalf of another, that your conduct is wrong, unnatural,
      indefensible, monstrous. And I tell you, sir,&rsquo; said Mr Pecksniff, towering
      on tiptoe among the curtains, as if he were literally rising above all
      worldly considerations, and were fain to hold on tight, to keep himself
      from darting skyward like a rocket, &lsquo;I tell you without fear or favour,
      that it will not do for you to be unmindful of your grandson, young
      Martin, who has the strongest natural claim upon you. It will not do,
      sir,&rsquo; repeated Mr Pecksniff, shaking his head. &lsquo;You may think it will do,
      but it won&rsquo;t. You must provide for that young man; you shall provide for
      him; you <i>will </i>provide for him. I believe,&rsquo; said Mr Pecksniff, glancing at
      the pen-and-ink, &lsquo;that in secret you have already done so. Bless you for
      doing so. Bless you for doing right, sir. Bless you for hating me. And
      good night!&rsquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      So saying, Mr Pecksniff waved his right hand with much solemnity, and once
      more inserting it in his waistcoat, departed. There was emotion in his
      manner, but his step was firm. Subject to human weaknesses, he was upheld
      by conscience.
    </p>
    <p>
      Martin lay for some time, with an expression on his face of silent wonder,
      not unmixed with rage; at length he muttered in a whisper:
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;What does this mean? Can the false-hearted boy have chosen such a tool as
      yonder fellow who has just gone out? Why not! He has conspired against me,
      like the rest, and they are but birds of one feather. A new plot; a new
      plot! Oh self, self, self! At every turn nothing but self!&rsquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      He fell to trifling, as he ceased to speak, with the ashes of the burnt
      paper in the candlestick. He did so, at first, in pure abstraction, but
      they presently became the subject of his thoughts.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Another will made and destroyed,&rsquo; he said, &lsquo;nothing determined on,
      nothing done, and I might have died to-night! I plainly see to what foul
      uses all this money will be put at last,&rsquo; he cried, almost writhing in the
      bed; &lsquo;after filling me with cares and miseries all my life, it will
      perpetuate discord and bad passions when I am dead. So it always is. What
      lawsuits grow out of the graves of rich men, every day; sowing perjury,
      hatred, and lies among near kindred, where there should be nothing but
      love! Heaven help us, we have much to answer for! Oh self, self, self!
      Every man for himself, and no creature for me!&rsquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      Universal self! Was there nothing of its shadow in these reflections, and
      in the history of Martin Chuzzlewit, on his own showing?

      FROM WHICH IT WILL APPEAR THAT IF UNION BE STRENGTH, AND FAMILY AFFECTION
      BE PLEASANT TO CONTEMPLATE, THE CHUZZLEWITS WERE THE STRONGEST AND MOST
      AGREEABLE FAMILY IN THE WORLD
    </p>
    <p>
      That worthy man Mr Pecksniff having taken leave of his cousin in the
      solemn terms recited in the last chapter, withdrew to his own home, and
      remained there three whole days; not so much as going out for a walk
      beyond the boundaries of his own garden, lest he should be hastily
      summoned to the bedside of his penitent and remorseful relative, whom, in
      his ample benevolence, he had made up his mind to forgive unconditionally,
      and to love on any terms. But such was the obstinacy and such the bitter
      nature of that stern old man, that no repentant summons came; and the
      fourth day found Mr Pecksniff apparently much farther from his Christian
      object than the first.
    </p>
    <p>
      During the whole of this interval, he haunted the Dragon at all times and
      seasons in the day and night, and, returning good for evil evinced the
      deepest solicitude in the progress of the obdurate invalid, in so much
      that Mrs Lupin was fairly melted by his disinterested anxiety (for he
      often particularly required her to take notice that he would do the same
      by any stranger or pauper in the like condition), and shed many tears of
      admiration and delight.
    </p>
    <p>
      Meantime, old Martin Chuzzlewit remained shut up in his own chamber, and
      saw no person but his young companion, saving the hostess of the Blue
      Dragon, who was, at certain times, admitted to his presence. So surely as
      she came into the room, however, Martin feigned to fall asleep. It was
      only when he and the young lady were alone, that he would utter a word,
      even in answer to the simplest inquiry; though Mr Pecksniff could make
      out, by hard listening at the door, that they two being left together, he
      was talkative enough.
    </p>
    <p>
      It happened on the fourth evening, that Mr Pecksniff walking, as usual,
      into the bar of the Dragon and finding no Mrs Lupin there, went straight
      upstairs; purposing, in the fervour of his affectionate zeal, to apply his
      ear once more to the keyhole, and quiet his mind by assuring himself that
      the hard-hearted patient was going on well. It happened that Mr Pecksniff,
      coming softly upon the dark passage into which a spiral ray of light
      usually darted through the same keyhole, was astonished to find no such
      ray visible; and it happened that Mr Pecksniff, when he had felt his way
      to the chamber-door, stooping hurriedly down to ascertain by personal
      inspection whether the jealousy of the old man had caused this keyhole to
      be stopped on the inside, brought his head into such violent contact with
      another head that he could not help uttering in an audible voice the
      monosyllable &lsquo;Oh!&rsquo; which was, as it were, sharply unscrewed and jerked out
      of him by very anguish. It happened then, and lastly, that Mr Pecksniff
      found himself immediately collared by something which smelt like several
      damp umbrellas, a barrel of beer, a cask of warm brandy-and-water, and a
      small parlour-full of stale tobacco smoke, mixed; and was straightway led
      downstairs into the bar from which he had lately come, where he found
      himself standing opposite to, and in the grasp of, a perfectly strange
      gentleman of still stranger appearance who, with his disengaged hand,
      rubbed his own head very hard, and looked at him, Pecksniff, with an evil
      countenance.
    </p>
    <p>
      The gentleman was of that order of appearance which is currently termed
      shabby-genteel, though in respect of his dress he can hardly be said to
      have been in any extremities, as his fingers were a long way out of his
      gloves, and the soles of his feet were at an inconvenient distance from
      the upper leather of his boots. His nether garments were of a bluish grey&mdash;violent
      in its colours once, but sobered now by age and dinginess&mdash;and were
      so stretched and strained in a tough conflict between his braces and his
      straps, that they appeared every moment in danger of flying asunder at the
      knees. His coat, in colour blue and of a military cut, was buttoned and
      frogged up to his chin. His cravat was, in hue and pattern, like one of
      those mantles which hairdressers are accustomed to wrap about their
      clients, during the progress of the professional mysteries. His hat had
      arrived at such a pass that it would have been hard to determine whether
      it was originally white or black. But he wore a moustache&mdash;a shaggy
      moustache too; nothing in the meek and merciful way, but quite in the
      fierce and scornful style; the regular Satanic sort of thing&mdash;and he
      wore, besides, a vast quantity of unbrushed hair. He was very dirty and
      very jaunty; very bold and very mean; very swaggering and very slinking;
      very much like a man who might have been something better, and unspeakably
      like a man who deserved to be something worse.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;You were eaves-dropping at that door, you vagabond!&rsquo; said this gentleman.
    </p>
    <p>
      Mr Pecksniff cast him off, as Saint George might have repudiated the
      Dragon in that animal&rsquo;s last moments, and said:
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Where is Mrs Lupin, I wonder! can the good woman possibly be aware that
      there is a person here who&mdash;&rsquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Stay!&rsquo; said the gentleman. &lsquo;Wait a bit. She <i>does </i>know. What then?&rsquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;What then, sir?&rsquo; cried Mr Pecksniff. &lsquo;What then? Do you know, sir, that I
      am the friend and relative of that sick gentleman? That I am his
      protector, his guardian, his&mdash;&rsquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Not his niece&rsquo;s husband,&rsquo; interposed the stranger, &lsquo;I&rsquo;ll be sworn; for he
      was there before you.&rsquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;What do you mean?&rsquo; said Mr Pecksniff, with indignant surprise. &lsquo;What do
      you tell me, sir?&rsquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Wait a bit!&rsquo; cried the other, &lsquo;Perhaps you are a cousin&mdash;the cousin
      who lives in this place?&rsquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;I <i>am</i> the cousin who lives in this place,&rsquo; replied the man of worth.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Your name is Pecksniff?&rsquo; said the gentleman.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;It is.&rsquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;I am proud to know you, and I ask your pardon,&rsquo; said the gentleman,
      touching his hat, and subsequently diving behind his cravat for a
      shirt-collar, which however he did not succeed in bringing to the surface.
      &lsquo;You behold in me, sir, one who has also an interest in that gentleman
      upstairs. Wait a bit.&rsquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      As he said this, he touched the tip of his high nose, by way of intimation
      that he would let Mr Pecksniff into a secret presently; and pulling off
      his hat, began to search inside the crown among a mass of crumpled
      documents and small pieces of what may be called the bark of broken
      cigars; whence he presently selected the cover of an old letter, begrimed
      with dirt and redolent of tobacco.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Read that,&rsquo; he cried, giving it to Mr Pecksniff.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;This is addressed to Chevy Slyme, Esquire,&rsquo; said that gentleman.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;You know Chevy Slyme, Esquire, I believe?&rsquo; returned the stranger.
    </p>
    <p>
      Mr Pecksniff shrugged his shoulders as though he would say &lsquo;I know there
      is such a person, and I am sorry for it.&rsquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Very good,&rsquo; remarked the gentleman. &lsquo;That is my interest and business
      here.&rsquo; With that he made another dive for his shirt-collar and brought up
      a string.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Now, this is very distressing, my friend,&rsquo; said Mr Pecksniff, shaking his
      head and smiling composedly. &lsquo;It is very distressing to me, to be
      compelled to say that you are not the person you claim to be. I know Mr
      Slyme, my friend; this will not do; honesty is the best policy you had
      better not; you had indeed.&rsquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Stop&rsquo; cried the gentleman, stretching forth his right arm, which was so
      tightly wedged into his threadbare sleeve that it looked like a cloth
      sausage. &lsquo;Wait a bit!&rsquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      He paused to establish himself immediately in front of the fire with his
      back towards it. Then gathering the skirts of his coat under his left arm,
      and smoothing his moustache with his right thumb and forefinger, he
      resumed:
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;I understand your mistake, and I am not offended. Why? Because it&rsquo;s
      complimentary. You suppose I would set myself up for Chevy Slyme. Sir, if
      there is a man on earth whom a gentleman would feel proud and honoured to
      be mistaken for, that man is my friend Slyme. For he is, without an
      exception, the highest-minded, the most independent-spirited, most
      original, spiritual, classical, talented, the most thoroughly
      Shakspearian, if not Miltonic, and at the same time the most
      disgustingly-unappreciated dog I know. But, sir, I have not the vanity to
      attempt to pass for Slyme. Any other man in the wide world, I am equal to;
      but Slyme is, I frankly confess, a great many cuts above me. Therefore you
      are wrong.&rsquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;I judged from this,&rsquo; said Mr Pecksniff, holding out the cover of the
      letter.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;No doubt you did,&rsquo; returned the gentleman. &lsquo;But, Mr Pecksniff, the whole
      thing resolves itself into an instance of the peculiarities of genius.
      Every man of true genius has his peculiarity. Sir, the peculiarity of my
      friend Slyme is, that he is always waiting round the corner. He is
      perpetually round the corner, sir. He is round the corner at this instant.
      Now,&rsquo; said the gentleman, shaking his forefinger before his nose, and
      planting his legs wider apart as he looked attentively in Mr Pecksniff&rsquo;s
      face, &lsquo;that is a remarkably curious and interesting trait in Mr Slyme&rsquo;s
      character; and whenever Slyme&rsquo;s life comes to be written, that trait must
      be thoroughly worked out by his biographer or society will not be
      satisfied. Observe me, society will not be satisfied!&rsquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      Mr Pecksniff coughed.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Slyme&rsquo;s biographer, sir, whoever he may be,&rsquo; resumed the gentleman, &lsquo;must
      apply to me; or, if I am gone to that what&rsquo;s-his-name from which no
      thingumbob comes back, he must apply to my executors for leave to search
      among my papers. I have taken a few notes in my poor way, of some of that
      man&rsquo;s proceedings&mdash;my adopted brother, sir,&mdash;which would amaze
      you. He made use of an expression, sir, only on the fifteenth of last
      month when he couldn&rsquo;t meet a little bill and the other party wouldn&rsquo;t
      renew, which would have done honour to Napoleon Bonaparte in addressing
      the French army.&rsquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;And pray,&rsquo; asked Mr Pecksniff, obviously not quite at his ease, &lsquo;what may
      be Mr Slyme&rsquo;s business here, if I may be permitted to inquire, who am
      compelled by a regard for my own character to disavow all interest in his
      proceedings?&rsquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;In the first place,&rsquo; returned the gentleman, &lsquo;you will permit me to say,
      that I object to that remark, and that I strongly and indignantly protest
      against it on behalf of my friend Slyme. In the next place, you will give
      me leave to introduce myself. My name, sir, is Tigg. The name of Montague
      Tigg will perhaps be familiar to you, in connection with the most
      remarkable events of the Peninsular War?&rsquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      Mr Pecksniff gently shook his head.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;No matter,&rsquo; said the gentleman. &lsquo;That man was my father, and I bear his
      name. I am consequently proud&mdash;proud as Lucifer. Excuse me one
      moment. I desire my friend Slyme to be present at the remainder of this
      conference.&rsquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      With this announcement he hurried away to the outer door of the Blue
      Dragon, and almost immediately returned with a companion shorter than
      himself, who was wrapped in an old blue camlet cloak with a lining of
      faded scarlet. His sharp features being much pinched and nipped by long
      waiting in the cold, and his straggling red whiskers and frowzy hair being
      more than usually dishevelled from the same cause, he certainly looked
      rather unwholesome and uncomfortable than Shakspearian or Miltonic.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Now,&rsquo; said Mr Tigg, clapping one hand on the shoulder of his
      prepossessing friend, and calling Mr Pecksniff&rsquo;s attention to him with the
      other, &lsquo;you two are related; and relations never did agree, and never
      will; which is a wise dispensation and an inevitable thing, or there would
      be none but family parties, and everybody in the world would bore
      everybody else to death. If you were on good terms, I should consider you
      a most confoundedly unnatural pair; but standing towards each other as you
      do, I took upon you as a couple of devilish deep-thoughted fellows, who
      may be reasoned with to any extent.&rsquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      Here Mr Chevy Slyme, whose great abilities seemed one and all to point
      towards the sneaking quarter of the moral compass, nudged his friend
      stealthily with his elbow, and whispered in his ear.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Chiv,&rsquo; said Mr Tigg aloud, in the high tone of one who was not to be
      tampered with. &lsquo;I shall come to that presently. I act upon my own
      responsibility, or not at all. To the extent of such a trifling loan as a
      crownpiece to a man of your talents, I look upon Mr Pecksniff as certain;&rsquo;
      and seeing at this juncture that the expression of Mr Pecksniff&rsquo;s face by
      no means betokened that he shared this certainty, Mr Tigg laid his finger
      on his nose again for that gentleman&rsquo;s private and especial behoof;
      calling upon him thereby to take notice that the requisition of small
      loans was another instance of the peculiarities of genius as developed in
      his friend Slyme; that he, Tigg, winked at the same, because of the strong
      metaphysical interest which these weaknesses possessed; and that in
      reference to his own personal advocacy of such small advances, he merely
      consulted the humour of his friend, without the least regard to his own
      advantage or necessities.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Oh, Chiv, Chiv!&rsquo; added Mr Tigg, surveying his adopted brother with an air
      of profound contemplation after dismissing this piece of pantomime. &lsquo;You
      are, upon my life, a strange instance of the little frailties that beset a
      mighty mind. If there had never been a telescope in the world, I should
      have been quite certain from my observation of you, Chiv, that there were
      spots on the sun! I wish I may die, if this isn&rsquo;t the queerest state of
      existence that we find ourselves forced into without knowing why or
      wherefore, Mr Pecksniff! Well, never mind! Moralise as we will, the world
      goes on. As Hamlet says, Hercules may lay about him with his club in every
      possible direction, but he can&rsquo;t prevent the cats from making a most
      intolerable row on the roofs of the houses, or the dogs from being shot in
      the hot weather if they run about the streets unmuzzled. Life&rsquo;s a riddle;
      a most infernally hard riddle to guess, Mr Pecksniff. My own opinions,
      that like that celebrated conundrum, &ldquo;Why&rsquo;s a man in jail like a man out
      of jail?&rdquo; there&rsquo;s no answer to it. Upon my soul and body, it&rsquo;s the
      queerest sort of thing altogether&mdash;but there&rsquo;s no use in talking
      about it. Ha! Ha!&rsquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      With which consolatory deduction from the gloomy premises recited, Mr Tigg
      roused himself by a great effort, and proceeded in his former strain.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Now I&rsquo;ll tell you what it is. I&rsquo;m a most confoundedly soft-hearted kind
      of fellow in my way, and I cannot stand by, and see you two blades cutting
      each other&rsquo;s throats when there&rsquo;s nothing to be got by it. Mr Pecksniff,
      you&rsquo;re the cousin of the testator upstairs and we&rsquo;re the nephew&mdash;I
      say we, meaning Chiv. Perhaps in all essential points you are more nearly
      related to him than we are. Very good. If so, so be it. But you can&rsquo;t get
      at him, neither can we. I give you my brightest word of honour, sir, that
      I&rsquo;ve been looking through that keyhole with short intervals of rest, ever
      since nine o&rsquo;clock this morning, in expectation of receiving an answer to
      one of the most moderate and gentlemanly applications for a little
      temporary assistance&mdash;only fifteen pounds, and <i>my</i> security&mdash;that
      the mind of man can conceive. In the meantime, sir, he is perpetually
      closeted with, and pouring his whole confidence into the bosom of, a
      stranger. Now I say decisively with regard to this state of circumstances,
      that it won&rsquo;t do; that it won&rsquo;t act; that it can&rsquo;t be; and that it must
      not be suffered to continue.&rsquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Every man,&rsquo; said Mr Pecksniff, &lsquo;has a right, an undoubted right, (which
      I, for one, would not call in question for any earthly consideration; oh
      no!) to regulate his own proceedings by his own likings and dislikings,
      supposing they are not immoral and not irreligious. I may feel in my own
      breast, that Mr Chuzzlewit does not regard&mdash;me, for instance; say me&mdash;with
      exactly that amount of Christian love which should subsist between us. I
      may feel grieved and hurt at the circumstance; still I may not rush to the
      conclusion that Mr Chuzzlewit is wholly without a justification in all his
      coldnesses. Heaven forbid! Besides; how, Mr Tigg,&rsquo; continued Pecksniff
      even more gravely and impressively than he had spoken yet, &lsquo;how could Mr
      Chuzzlewit be prevented from having these peculiar and most extraordinary
      confidences of which you speak; the existence of which I must admit; and
      which I cannot but deplore&mdash;for his sake? Consider, my good sir&mdash;&rsquo;
      and here Mr Pecksniff eyed him wistfully&mdash;&lsquo;how very much at random
      you are talking.&rsquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Why, as to that,&rsquo; rejoined Tigg, &lsquo;it certainly is a difficult question.&rsquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Undoubtedly it is a difficult question,&rsquo; Mr Pecksniff answered. As he
      spoke he drew himself aloft, and seemed to grow more mindful, suddenly, of
      the moral gulf between himself and the creature he addressed. &lsquo;Undoubtedly
      it is a very difficult question. And I am far from feeling sure that it is
      a question any one is authorized to discuss. Good evening to you.&rsquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;You don&rsquo;t know that the Spottletoes are here, I suppose?&rsquo; said Mr Tigg.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;What do you mean, sir? what Spottletoes?&rsquo; asked Pecksniff, stopping
      abruptly on his way to the door.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Mr and Mrs Spottletoe,&rsquo; said Chevy Slyme, Esquire, speaking aloud for the
      first time, and speaking very sulkily; shambling with his legs the while.
      &lsquo;Spottletoe married my father&rsquo;s brother&rsquo;s child, didn&rsquo;t he? And Mrs
      Spottletoe is Chuzzlewit&rsquo;s own niece, isn&rsquo;t she? She was his favourite
      once. You may well ask what Spottletoes.&rsquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Now upon my sacred word!&rsquo; cried Mr Pecksniff, looking upwards. &lsquo;This is
      dreadful. The rapacity of these people is absolutely frightful!&rsquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;It&rsquo;s not only the Spottletoes either, Tigg,&rsquo; said Slyme, looking at that
      gentleman and speaking at Mr Pecksniff. &lsquo;Anthony Chuzzlewit and his son
      have got wind of it, and have come down this afternoon. I saw &lsquo;em not five
      minutes ago, when I was waiting round the corner.&rsquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Oh, Mammon, Mammon!&rsquo; cried Mr Pecksniff, smiting his forehead.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;So there,&rsquo; said Slyme, regardless of the interruption, &lsquo;are his brother
      and another nephew for you, already.&rsquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;This is the whole thing, sir,&rsquo; said Mr Tigg; &lsquo;this is the point and
      purpose at which I was gradually arriving when my friend Slyme here, with
      six words, hit it full. Mr Pecksniff, now that your cousin (and Chiv&rsquo;s
      uncle) has turned up, some steps must be taken to prevent his disappearing
      again; and, if possible, to counteract the influence which is exercised
      over him now, by this designing favourite. Everybody who is interested
      feels it, sir. The whole family is pouring down to this place. The time
      has come when individual jealousies and interests must be forgotten for a
      time, sir, and union must be made against the common enemy. When the
      common enemy is routed, you will all set up for yourselves again; every
      lady and gentleman who has a part in the game, will go in on their own
      account and bowl away, to the best of their ability, at the testator&rsquo;s
      wicket, and nobody will be in a worse position than before. Think of it.
      Don&rsquo;t commit yourself now. You&rsquo;ll find us at the Half Moon and Seven Stars
      in this village, at any time, and open to any reasonable proposition. Hem!
      Chiv, my dear fellow, go out and see what sort of a night it is.&rsquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      Mr Slyme lost no time in disappearing, and it is to be presumed in going
      round the corner. Mr Tigg, planting his legs as wide apart as he could be
      reasonably expected by the most sanguine man to keep them, shook his head
      at Mr Pecksniff and smiled.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;We must not be too hard,&rsquo; he said, &lsquo;upon the little eccentricities of our
      friend Slyme. You saw him whisper me?&rsquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      Mr Pecksniff had seen him.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;You heard my answer, I think?&rsquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      Mr Pecksniff had heard it.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Five shillings, eh?&rsquo; said Mr Tigg, thoughtfully. &lsquo;Ah! what an
      extraordinary fellow! Very moderate too!&rsquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      Mr Pecksniff made no answer.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Five shillings!&rsquo; pursued Mr Tigg, musing; &lsquo;and to be punctually repaid
      next week; that&rsquo;s the best of it. You heard that?&rsquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      Mr Pecksniff had not heard that.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;No! You surprise me!&rsquo; cried Tigg. &lsquo;That&rsquo;s the cream of the thing sir. I
      never knew that man fail to redeem a promise, in my life. You&rsquo;re not in
      want of change, are you?&rsquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;No,&rsquo; said Mr Pecksniff, &lsquo;thank you. Not at all.&rsquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Just so,&rsquo; returned Mr Tigg. &lsquo;If you had been, I&rsquo;d have got it for you.&rsquo;
      With that he began to whistle; but a dozen seconds had not elapsed when he
      stopped short, and looking earnestly at Mr Pecksniff, said:
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Perhaps you&rsquo;d rather not lend Slyme five shillings?&rsquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;I would much rather not,&rsquo; Mr Pecksniff rejoined.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Egad!&rsquo; cried Tigg, gravely nodding his head as if some ground of
      objection occurred to him at that moment for the first time, &lsquo;it&rsquo;s very
      possible you may be right. Would you entertain the same sort of objection
      to lending me five shillings now?&rsquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Yes, I couldn&rsquo;t do it, indeed,&rsquo; said Mr Pecksniff.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Not even half-a-crown, perhaps?&rsquo; urged Mr Tigg.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Not even half-a-crown.&rsquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Why, then we come,&rsquo; said Mr Tigg, &lsquo;to the ridiculously small amount of
      eighteen pence. Ha! ha!&rsquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;And that,&rsquo; said Mr Pecksniff, &lsquo;would be equally objectionable.&rsquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      On receipt of this assurance, Mr Tigg shook him heartily by both hands,
      protesting with much earnestness, that he was one of the most consistent
      and remarkable men he had ever met, and that he desired the honour of his
      better acquaintance. He moreover observed that there were many little
      characteristics about his friend Slyme, of which he could by no means, as
      a man of strict honour, approve; but that he was prepared to forgive him
      all these slight drawbacks, and much more, in consideration of the great
      pleasure he himself had that day enjoyed in his social intercourse with Mr
      Pecksniff, which had given him a far higher and more enduring delight than
      the successful negotiation of any small loan on the part of his friend
      could possibly have imparted. With which remarks he would beg leave, he
      said, to wish Mr Pecksniff a very good evening. And so he took himself
      off; as little abashed by his recent failure as any gentleman would desire
      to be.
    </p>
    <p>
      The meditations of Mr Pecksniff that evening at the bar of the Dragon, and
      that night in his own house, were very serious and grave indeed; the more
      especially as the intelligence he had received from Messrs Tigg and Slyme
      touching the arrival of other members of the family, were fully confirmed
      on more particular inquiry. For the Spottletoes had actually gone straight
      to the Dragon, where they were at that moment housed and mounting guard,
      and where their appearance had occasioned such a vast sensation that Mrs
      Lupin, scenting their errand before they had been under her roof half an
      hour, carried the news herself with all possible secrecy straight to Mr
      Pecksniff&rsquo;s house; indeed it was her great caution in doing so which
      occasioned her to miss that gentleman, who entered at the front door of
      the Dragon just as she emerged from the back one. Moreover, Mr Anthony
      Chuzzlewit and his son Jonas were economically quartered at the Half Moon
      and Seven Stars, which was an obscure ale-house; and by the very next
      coach there came posting to the scene of action, so many other
      affectionate members of the family (who quarrelled with each other, inside
      and out, all the way down, to the utter distraction of the coachman), that
      in less than four-and-twenty hours the scanty tavern accommodation was at
      a premium, and all the private lodgings in the place, amounting to full
      four beds and sofa, rose cent per cent in the market.
    </p>
    <p>
      In a word, things came to that pass that nearly the whole family sat down
      before the Blue Dragon, and formally invested it; and Martin Chuzzlewit
      was in a state of siege. But he resisted bravely; refusing to receive all
      letters, messages, and parcels; obstinately declining to treat with
      anybody; and holding out no hope or promise of capitulation. Meantime the
      family forces were perpetually encountering each other in divers parts of
      the neighbourhood; and, as no one branch of the Chuzzlewit tree had ever
      been known to agree with another within the memory of man, there was such
      a skirmishing, and flouting, and snapping off of heads, in the
      metaphorical sense of that expression; such a bandying of words and
      calling of names; such an upturning of noses and wrinkling of brows; such
      a formal interment of good feelings and violent resurrection of ancient
      grievances; as had never been known in those quiet parts since the
      earliest record of their civilized existence.
    </p>
    <p>
      At length, in utter despair and hopelessness, some few of the belligerents
      began to speak to each other in only moderate terms of mutual aggravation;
      and nearly all addressed themselves with a show of tolerable decency to Mr
      Pecksniff, in recognition of his high character and influential position.
      Thus, by little and little, they made common cause of Martin Chuzzlewit&rsquo;s
      obduracy, until it was agreed (if such a word can be used in connection
      with the Chuzzlewits) that there should be a general council and
      conference held at Mr Pecksniff&rsquo;s house upon a certain day at noon; which
      all members of the family who had brought themselves within reach of the
      summons, were forthwith bidden and invited, solemnly, to attend.
    </p>
    <p>
      If ever Mr Pecksniff wore an apostolic look, he wore it on this memorable
      day. If ever his unruffled smile proclaimed the words, &lsquo;I am a messenger
      of peace!&rsquo; that was its mission now. If ever man combined within himself
      all the mild qualities of the lamb with a considerable touch of the dove,
      and not a dash of the crocodile, or the least possible suggestion of the
      very mildest seasoning of the serpent, that man was he. And, oh, the two
      Miss Pecksniffs! Oh, the serene expression on the face of Charity, which
      seemed to say, &lsquo;I know that all my family have injured me beyond the
      possibility of reparation, but I forgive them, for it is my duty so to
      do!&rsquo; And, oh, the gay simplicity of Mercy; so charming, innocent, and
      infant-like, that if she had gone out walking by herself, and it had been
      a little earlier in the season, the robin-redbreasts might have covered
      her with leaves against her will, believing her to be one of the sweet
      children in the wood, come out of it, and issuing forth once more to look
      for blackberries in the young freshness of her heart! What words can paint
      the Pecksniffs in that trying hour? Oh, none; for words have naughty
      company among them, and the Pecksniffs were all goodness.
    </p>
    <p>
      But when the company arrived! That was the time. When Mr Pecksniff, rising
      from his seat at the table&rsquo;s head, with a daughter on either hand,
      received his guests in the best parlour and motioned them to chairs, with
      eyes so overflowing and countenance so damp with gracious perspiration,
      that he may be said to have been in a kind of moist meekness! And the
      company; the jealous stony-hearted distrustful company, who were all shut
      up in themselves, and had no faith in anybody, and wouldn&rsquo;t believe
      anything, and would no more allow themselves to be softened or lulled
      asleep by the Pecksniffs than if they had been so many hedgehogs or
      porcupines!
    </p>
    <p>
      First, there was Mr Spottletoe, who was so bald and had such big whiskers,
      that he seemed to have stopped his hair, by the sudden application of some
      powerful remedy, in the very act of falling off his head, and to have
      fastened it irrevocably on his face. Then there was Mrs Spottletoe, who
      being much too slim for her years, and of a poetical constitution, was
      accustomed to inform her more intimate friends that the said whiskers were
      &lsquo;the lodestar of her existence;&rsquo; and who could now, by reason of her
      strong affection for her uncle Chuzzlewit, and the shock it gave her to be
      suspected of testamentary designs upon him, do nothing but cry&mdash;except
      moan. Then there were Anthony Chuzzlewit, and his son Jonas; the face of
      the old man so sharpened by the wariness and cunning of his life, that it
      seemed to cut him a passage through the crowded room, as he edged away
      behind the remotest chairs; while the son had so well profited by the
      precept and example of the father, that he looked a year or two the elder
      of the twain, as they stood winking their red eyes, side by side, and
      whispering to each other softly. Then there was the widow of a deceased
      brother of Mr Martin Chuzzlewit, who being almost supernaturally
      disagreeable, and having a dreary face and a bony figure and a masculine
      voice, was, in right of these qualities, what is commonly called a
      strong-minded woman; and who, if she could, would have established her
      claim to the title, and have shown herself, mentally speaking, a perfect
      Samson, by shutting up her brother-in-law in a private madhouse, until he
      proved his complete sanity by loving her very much. Beside her sat her
      spinster daughters, three in number, and of gentlemanly deportment, who
      had so mortified themselves with tight stays, that their tempers were
      reduced to something less than their waists, and sharp lacing was
      expressed in their very noses. Then there was a young gentleman,
      grandnephew of Mr Martin Chuzzlewit, very dark and very hairy, and
      apparently born for no particular purpose but to save looking-glasses the
      trouble of reflecting more than just the first idea and sketchy notion of
      a face, which had never been carried out. Then there was a solitary female
      cousin who was remarkable for nothing but being very deaf, and living by
      herself, and always having the toothache. Then there was George
      Chuzzlewit, a gay bachelor cousin, who claimed to be young but had been
      younger, and was inclined to corpulency, and rather overfed himself; to
      that extent, indeed, that his eyes were strained in their sockets, as if
      with constant surprise; and he had such an obvious disposition to pimples,
      that the bright spots on his cravat, the rich pattern on his waistcoat,
      and even his glittering trinkets, seemed to have broken out upon him, and
      not to have come into existence comfortably. Last of all there were
      present Mr Chevy Slyme and his friend Tigg. And it is worthy of remark,
      that although each person present disliked the other, mainly because he or
      she <i>did </i>belong to the family, they one and all concurred in hating Mr Tigg
      because he didn&rsquo;t.

    <p>
      Such was the pleasant little family circle now assembled in Mr Pecksniff&rsquo;s
      best parlour, agreeably prepared to fall foul of Mr Pecksniff or anybody
      else who might venture to say anything whatever upon any subject.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;This,&rsquo; said Mr Pecksniff, rising and looking round upon them with folded
      hands, &lsquo;does me good. It does my daughters good. We thank you for
      assembling here. We are grateful to you with our whole hearts. It is a
      blessed distinction that you have conferred upon us, and believe me&rsquo;&mdash;it
      is impossible to conceive how he smiled here&mdash;&lsquo;we shall not easily
      forget it.&rsquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;I am sorry to interrupt you, Pecksniff,&rsquo; remarked Mr Spottletoe, with his
      whiskers in a very portentous state; &lsquo;but you are assuming too much to
      yourself, sir. Who do you imagine has it in contemplation to confer a
      distinction upon <i>you</i>, sir?&rsquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      A general murmur echoed this inquiry, and applauded it.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;If you are about to pursue the course with which you have begun, sir,&rsquo;
      pursued Mr Spottletoe in a great heat, and giving a violent rap on the
      table with his knuckles, &lsquo;the sooner you desist, and this assembly
      separates, the better. I am no stranger, sir, to your preposterous desire
      to be regarded as the head of this family, but I can tell <i>you</i>, sir&mdash;&rsquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      Oh yes, indeed! <i>He</i> tell. <i>He</i>! What? He was the head, was he? From the
      strong-minded woman downwards everybody fell, that instant, upon Mr.
      Spottletoe, who after vainly attempting to be heard in silence was fain to
      sit down again, folding his arms and shaking his head most wrathfully, and
      giving Mrs Spottletoe to understand in dumb show, that that scoundrel
      Pecksniff might go on for the present, but he would cut in presently, and
      annihilate him.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;I am not sorry,&rsquo; said Mr Pecksniff in resumption of his address, &lsquo;I am
      really not sorry that this little incident has happened. It is good to
      feel that we are met here without disguise. It is good to know that we
      have no reserve before each other, but are appearing freely in our own
      characters.&rsquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      Here, the eldest daughter of the strong-minded woman rose a little way
      from her seat, and trembling violently from head to foot, more as it
      seemed with passion than timidity, expressed a general hope that some
      people <i>would </i>appear in their own characters, if it were only for such a
      proceeding having the attraction of novelty to recommend it; and that when
      they (meaning the some people before mentioned) talked about their
      relations, they would be careful to observe who was present in company at
      the time; otherwise it might come round to those relations&rsquo; ears, in a way
      they little expected; and as to red noses (she observed) she had yet to
      learn that a red nose was any disgrace, inasmuch as people neither made
      nor coloured their own noses, but had that feature provided for them
      without being first consulted; though even upon that branch of the subject
      she had great doubts whether certain noses were redder than other noses,
      or indeed half as red as some. This remark being received with a shrill
      titter by the two sisters of the speaker, Miss Charity Pecksniff begged
      with much politeness to be informed whether any of those very low
      observations were levelled at her; and receiving no more explanatory
      answer than was conveyed in the adage &lsquo;Those the cap fits, let them wear
      it,&rsquo; immediately commenced a somewhat acrimonious and personal retort,
      wherein she was much comforted and abetted by her sister Mercy, who
      laughed at the same with great heartiness; indeed far more naturally than
      life. And it being quite impossible that any difference of opinion can
      take place among women without every woman who is within hearing taking
      active part in it, the strong-minded lady and her two daughters, and Mrs
      Spottletoe, and the deaf cousin (who was not at all disqualified from
      joining in the dispute by reason of being perfectly unacquainted with its
      merits), one and all plunged into the quarrel directly.
    </p>
    <p>
      The two Miss Pecksniffs being a pretty good match for the three Miss
      Chuzzlewits, and all five young ladies having, in the figurative language
      of the day, a great amount of steam to dispose of, the altercation would
      no doubt have been a long one but for the high valour and prowess of the
      strong-minded woman, who, in right of her reputation for powers of
      sarcasm, did so belabour and pummel Mrs Spottletoe with taunting words
      that the poor lady, before the engagement was two minutes old, had no
      refuge but in tears. These she shed so plentifully, and so much to the
      agitation and grief of Mr Spottletoe, that that gentleman, after holding
      his clenched fist close to Mr Pecksniff&rsquo;s eyes, as if it were some natural
      curiosity from the near inspection whereof he was likely to derive high
      gratification and improvement, and after offering (for no particular
      reason that anybody could discover) to kick Mr George Chuzzlewit for, and
      in consideration of, the trifling sum of sixpence, took his wife under his
      arm and indignantly withdrew. This diversion, by distracting the attention
      of the combatants, put an end to the strife, which, after breaking out
      afresh some twice or thrice in certain inconsiderable spurts and dashes,
      died away in silence.
    </p>
    <p>
      It was then that Mr Pecksniff once more rose from his chair. It was then
      that the two Miss Pecksniffs composed themselves to look as if there were
      no such beings&mdash;not to say present, but in the whole compass of the
      world&mdash;as the three Miss Chuzzlewits; while the three Miss
      Chuzzlewits became equally unconscious of the existence of the two Miss
      Pecksniffs.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;It is to be lamented,&rsquo; said Mr Pecksniff, with a forgiving recollection
      of Mr Spottletoe&rsquo;s fist, &lsquo;that our friend should have withdrawn himself so
      very hastily, though we have cause for mutual congratulation even in that,
      since we are assured that he is not distrustful of us in regard to
      anything we may say or do while he is absent. Now, that is very soothing,
      is it not?&rsquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Pecksniff,&rsquo; said Anthony, who had been watching the whole party with
      peculiar keenness from the first&mdash;&lsquo;don&rsquo;t you be a hypocrite.&rsquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;A what, my good sir?&rsquo; demanded Mr Pecksniff.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;A hypocrite.&rsquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Charity, my dear,&rsquo; said Mr Pecksniff, &lsquo;when I take my chamber candlestick
      to-night, remind me to be more than usually particular in praying for Mr
      Anthony Chuzzlewit; who has done me an injustice.&rsquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      This was said in a very bland voice, and aside, as being addressed to his
      daughter&rsquo;s private ear. With a cheerfulness of conscience, prompting
      almost a sprightly demeanour, he then resumed:
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;All our thoughts centring in our very dear but unkind relative, and he
      being as it were beyond our reach, we are met to-day, really as if we were
      a funeral party, except&mdash;a blessed exception&mdash;that there is no
      body in the house.&rsquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      The strong-minded lady was not at all sure that this was a blessed
      exception. Quite the contrary.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Well, my dear madam!&rsquo; said Mr Pecksniff. &lsquo;Be that as it may, here we are;
      and being here, we are to consider whether it is possible by any
      justifiable means&mdash;&rsquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Why, you know as well as I,&rsquo; said the strong-minded lady, &lsquo;that any means
      are justifiable in such a case, don&rsquo;t you?&rsquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Very good, my dear madam, very good; whether it is possible by <i>any </i>means,
      we will say by <i>any </i>means, to open the eyes of our valued relative to his
      present infatuation. Whether it is possible to make him acquainted by any
      means with the real character and purpose of that young female whose
      strange, whose very strange position, in reference to himself&rsquo;&mdash;here
      Mr Pecksniff sunk his voice to an impressive whisper&mdash;&lsquo;really casts a
      shadow of disgrace and shame upon this family; and who, we know&rsquo;&mdash;here
      he raised his voice again&mdash;&lsquo;else why is she his companion? harbours
      the very basest designs upon his weakness and his property.&rsquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      In their strong feeling on this point, they, who agreed in nothing else,
      all concurred as one mind. Good Heaven, that she should harbour designs
      upon his property! The strong-minded lady was for poison, her three
      daughters were for Bridewell and bread-and-water, the cousin with the
      toothache advocated Botany Bay, the two Miss Pecksniffs suggested
      flogging. Nobody but Mr Tigg, who, notwithstanding his extreme shabbiness,
      was still understood to be in some sort a lady&rsquo;s man, in right of his
      upper lip and his frogs, indicated a doubt of the justifiable nature of
      these measures; and he only ogled the three Miss Chuzzlewits with the
      least admixture of banter in his admiration, as though he would observe,
      &lsquo;You are positively down upon her to too great an extent, my sweet
      creatures, upon my soul you are!&rsquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Now,&rsquo; said Mr Pecksniff, crossing his two forefingers in a manner which
      was at once conciliatory and argumentative; &lsquo;I will not, upon the one
      hand, go so far as to say that she deserves all the inflictions which have
      been so very forcibly and hilariously suggested;&rsquo; one of his ornamental
      sentences; &lsquo;nor will I, upon the other, on any account compromise my
      common understanding as a man, by making the assertion that she does not.
      What I would observe is, that I think some practical means might be
      devised of inducing our respected, shall I say our revered&mdash;?&rsquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;No!&rsquo; interposed the strong-minded woman in a loud voice.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Then I will not,&rsquo; said Mr Pecksniff. &lsquo;You are quite right, my dear madam,
      and I appreciate and thank you for your discriminating objection&mdash;our
      respected relative, to dispose himself to listen to the promptings of
      nature, and not to the&mdash;&rsquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Go on, Pa!&rsquo; cried Mercy.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Why, the truth is, my dear,&rsquo; said Mr Pecksniff, smiling upon his
      assembled kindred, &lsquo;that I am at a loss for a word. The name of those
      fabulous animals (pagan, I regret to say) who used to sing in the water,
      has quite escaped me.&rsquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      Mr George Chuzzlewit suggested &lsquo;swans.&rsquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;No,&rsquo; said Mr Pecksniff. &lsquo;Not swans. Very like swans, too. Thank you.&rsquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      The nephew with the outline of a countenance, speaking for the first and
      last time on that occasion, propounded &lsquo;Oysters.&rsquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;No,&rsquo; said Mr Pecksniff, with his own peculiar urbanity, &lsquo;nor oysters. But
      by no means unlike oysters; a very excellent idea; thank you, my dear sir,
      very much. Wait! Sirens. Dear me! sirens, of course. I think, I say, that
      means might be devised of disposing our respected relative to listen to
      the promptings of nature, and not to the siren-like delusions of art. Now
      we must not lose sight of the fact that our esteemed friend has a
      grandson, to whom he was, until lately, very much attached, and whom I
      could have wished to see here to-day, for I have a real and deep regard
      for him. A fine young man, a very fine young man! I would submit to you,
      whether we might not remove Mr Chuzzlewit&rsquo;s distrust of us, and vindicate
      our own disinterestedness by&mdash;&rsquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;If Mr George Chuzzlewit has anything to say to <i>me</i>,&rsquo; interposed the
      strong-minded woman, sternly, &lsquo;I beg him to speak out like a man; and not
      to look at me and my daughters as if he could eat us.&rsquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;As to looking, I have heard it said, Mrs Ned,&rsquo; returned Mr George,
      angrily, &lsquo;that a cat is free to contemplate a monarch; and therefore I
      hope I have some right, having been born a member of this family, to look
      at a person who only came into it by marriage. As to eating, I beg to say,
      whatever bitterness your jealousies and disappointed expectations may
      suggest to you, that I am not a cannibal, ma&rsquo;am.&rsquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;I don&rsquo;t know that!&rsquo; cried the strong-minded woman.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;At all events, if I was a cannibal,&rsquo; said Mr George Chuzzlewit, greatly
      stimulated by this retort, &lsquo;I think it would occur to me that a lady who
      had outlived three husbands, and suffered so very little from their loss,
      must be most uncommonly tough.&rsquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      The strong-minded woman immediately rose.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;And I will further add,&rsquo; said Mr George, nodding his head violently at
      every second syllable; &lsquo;naming no names, and therefore hurting nobody but
      those whose consciences tell them they are alluded to, that I think it
      would be much more decent and becoming, if those who hooked and crooked
      themselves into this family by getting on the blind side of some of its
      members before marriage, and manslaughtering them afterwards by crowing
      over them to that strong pitch that they were glad to die, would refrain
      from acting the part of vultures in regard to other members of this family
      who are living. I think it would be full as well, if not better, if those
      individuals would keep at home, contenting themselves with what they have
      got (luckily for them) already; instead of hovering about, and thrusting
      their fingers into, a family pie, which they flavour much more than
      enough, I can tell them, when they are fifty miles away.&rsquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;I might have been prepared for this!&rsquo; cried the strong-minded woman,
      looking about her with a disdainful smile as she moved towards the door,
      followed by her three daughters. &lsquo;Indeed I was fully prepared for it from
      the first. What else could I expect in such an atmosphere as this!&rsquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Don&rsquo;t direct your halfpay-officers&rsquo; gaze at me, ma&rsquo;am, if you please,&rsquo;
      interposed Miss Charity; &lsquo;for I won&rsquo;t bear it.&rsquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      This was a smart stab at a pension enjoyed by the strong-minded woman,
      during her second widowhood and before her last coverture. It told
      immensely.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;I passed from the memory of a grateful country, you very miserable minx,&rsquo;
      said Mrs Ned, &lsquo;when I entered this family; and I feel now, though I did
      not feel then, that it served me right, and that I lost my claim upon the
      United Kingdom of Great Britain and Ireland when I so degraded myself.
      Now, my dears, if you&rsquo;re quite ready, and have sufficiently improved
      yourselves by taking to heart the genteel example of these two young
      ladies, I think we&rsquo;ll go. Mr Pecksniff, we are very much obliged to you,
      really. We came to be entertained, and you have far surpassed our utmost
      expectations, in the amusement you have provided for us. Thank you.
      Good-bye!&rsquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      With such departing words, did this strong-minded female paralyse the
      Pecksniffian energies; and so she swept out of the room, and out of the
      house, attended by her daughters, who, as with one accord, elevated their
      three noses in the air, and joined in a contemptuous titter. As they
      passed the parlour window on the outside, they were seen to counterfeit a
      perfect transport of delight among themselves; and with this final blow
      and great discouragement for those within, they vanished.
    </p>
    <p>
      Before Mr Pecksniff or any of his remaining visitors could offer a remark,
      another figure passed this window, coming, at a great rate in the opposite
      direction; and immediately afterwards, Mr Spottletoe burst into the
      chamber. Compared with his present state of heat, he had gone out a man of
      snow or ice. His head distilled such oil upon his whiskers, that they were
      rich and clogged with unctuous drops; his face was violently inflamed, his
      limbs trembled; and he gasped and strove for breath.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;My good sir!&rsquo; cried Mr Pecksniff.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Oh yes!&rsquo; returned the other; &lsquo;oh yes, certainly! Oh to be sure! Oh, of
      course! You hear him? You hear him? all of you!&rsquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;What&rsquo;s the matter?&rsquo; cried several voices.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Oh nothing!&rsquo; cried Spottletoe, still gasping. &lsquo;Nothing at all! It&rsquo;s of no
      consequence! Ask him! <i>He</i>&rsquo;ll tell you!&rsquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;I do not understand our friend,&rsquo; said Mr Pecksniff, looking about him in
      utter amazement. &lsquo;I assure you that he is quite unintelligible to me.&rsquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Unintelligible, sir!&rsquo; cried the other. &lsquo;Unintelligible! Do you mean to
      say, sir, that you don&rsquo;t know what has happened! That you haven&rsquo;t decoyed
      us here, and laid a plot and a plan against us! Will you venture to say
      that you didn&rsquo;t know Mr Chuzzlewit was going, sir, and that you don&rsquo;t know
      he&rsquo;s gone, sir?&rsquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Gone!&rsquo; was the general cry.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Gone,&rsquo; echoed Mr Spottletoe. &lsquo;Gone while we were sitting here. Gone.
      Nobody knows where he&rsquo;s gone. Oh, of course not! Nobody knew he was going.
      Oh, of course not! The landlady thought up to the very last moment that
      they were merely going for a ride; she had no other suspicion. Oh, of
      course not! She&rsquo;s not this fellow&rsquo;s creature. Oh, of course not!&rsquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      Adding to these exclamations a kind of ironical howl, and gazing upon the
      company for one brief instant afterwards, in a sudden silence, the
      irritated gentleman started off again at the same tremendous pace, and was
      seen no more.
    </p>
    <p>
      It was in vain for Mr Pecksniff to assure them that this new and opportune
      evasion of the family was at least as great a shock and surprise to him as
      to anybody else. Of all the bullyings and denunciations that were ever
      heaped on one unlucky head, none can ever have exceeded in energy and
      heartiness those with which he was complimented by each of his remaining
      relatives, singly, upon bidding him farewell.
    </p>
    <p>
      The moral position taken by Mr Tigg was something quite tremendous; and
      the deaf cousin, who had the complicated aggravation of seeing all the
      proceedings and hearing nothing but the catastrophe, actually scraped her
      shoes upon the scraper, and afterwards distributed impressions of them all
      over the top step, in token that she shook the dust from her feet before
      quitting that dissembling and perfidious mansion.
    </p>
    <p>
      Mr Pecksniff had, in short, but one comfort, and that was the knowledge
      that all these his relations and friends had hated him to the very utmost
      extent before; and that he, for his part, had not distributed among them
      any more love than, with his ample capital in that respect, he could
      comfortably afford to part with. This view of his affairs yielded him
      great consolation; and the fact deserves to be noted, as showing with what
      ease a good man may be consoled under circumstances of failure and
      disappointment.

    <h2>
      CHAPTER FIVE
    </h2>
    <p>
      CONTAINING A FULL ACCOUNT OF THE INSTALLATION OF MR PECKSNIFF&rsquo;S NEW PUPIL
      INTO THE BOSOM OF MR PECKSNIFF&rsquo;S FAMILY. WITH ALL THE FESTIVITIES HELD ON
      THAT OCCASION, AND THE GREAT ENJOYMENT OF MR PINCH
    </p>
    <p>
      The best of architects and land surveyors kept a horse, in whom the
      enemies already mentioned more than once in these pages pretended to
      detect a fanciful resemblance to his master. Not in his outward person,
      for he was a raw-boned, haggard horse, always on a much shorter allowance
      of corn than Mr Pecksniff; but in his moral character, wherein, said they,
      he was full of promise, but of no performance. He was always in a manner,
      going to go, and never going. When at his slowest rate of travelling he
      would sometimes lift up his legs so high, and display such mighty action,
      that it was difficult to believe he was doing less than fourteen miles an
      hour; and he was for ever so perfectly satisfied with his own speed, and
      so little disconcerted by opportunities of comparing himself with the
      fastest trotters, that the illusion was the more difficult of resistance.
      He was a kind of animal who infused into the breasts of strangers a lively
      sense of hope, and possessed all those who knew him better with a grim
      despair. In what respect, having these points of character, he might be
      fairly likened to his master, that good man&rsquo;s slanderers only can explain.
      But it is a melancholy truth, and a deplorable instance of the
      uncharitableness of the world, that they made the comparison.
    </p>
    <p>
      In this horse, and the hooded vehicle, whatever its proper name might be,
      to which he was usually harnessed&mdash;it was more like a gig with a
      tumour than anything else&mdash;all Mr Pinch&rsquo;s thoughts and wishes
      centred, one bright frosty morning; for with this gallant equipage he was
      about to drive to Salisbury alone, there to meet with the new pupil, and
      thence to bring him home in triumph.
    </p>
    <p>
      Blessings on thy simple heart, Tom Pinch, how proudly dost thou button up
      that scanty coat, called by a sad misnomer, for these many years, a
      &lsquo;great&rsquo; one; and how thoroughly, as with thy cheerful voice thou
      pleasantly adjurest Sam the hostler &lsquo;not to let him go yet,&rsquo; dost thou
      believe that quadruped desires to go, and would go if he might! Who could
      repress a smile&mdash;of love for thee, Tom Pinch, and not in jest at thy
      expense, for thou art poor enough already, Heaven knows&mdash;to think
      that such a holiday as lies before thee should awaken that quick flow and
      hurry of the spirits, in which thou settest down again, almost untasted,
      on the kitchen window-sill, that great white mug (put by, by thy own
      hands, last night, that breakfast might not hold thee late), and layest
      yonder crust upon the seat beside thee, to be eaten on the road, when thou
      art calmer in thy high rejoicing! Who, as thou drivest off, a happy, man,
      and noddest with a grateful lovingness to Pecksniff in his nightcap at his
      chamber-window, would not cry, &lsquo;Heaven speed thee, Tom, and send that thou
      wert going off for ever to some quiet home where thou mightst live at
      peace, and sorrow should not touch thee!&rsquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      What better time for driving, riding, walking, moving through the air by
      any means, than a fresh, frosty morning, when hope runs cheerily through
      the veins with the brisk blood, and tingles in the frame from head to
      foot! This was the glad commencement of a bracing day in early winter,
      such as may put the languid summer season (speaking of it when it can&rsquo;t be
      had) to the blush, and shame the spring for being sometimes cold by
      halves. The sheep-bells rang as clearly in the vigorous air, as if they
      felt its wholesome influence like living creatures; the trees, in lieu of
      leaves or blossoms, shed upon the ground a frosty rime that sparkled as it
      fell, and might have been the dust of diamonds. So it was to Tom. From
      cottage chimneys, smoke went streaming up high, high, as if the earth had
      lost its grossness, being so fair, and must not be oppressed by heavy
      vapour. The crust of ice on the else rippling brook was so transparent,
      and so thin in texture, that the lively water might of its own free will
      have stopped&mdash;in Tom&rsquo;s glad mind it had&mdash;to look upon the lovely
      morning. And lest the sun should break this charm too eagerly, there moved
      between him and the ground, a mist like that which waits upon the moon on
      summer nights&mdash;the very same to Tom&mdash;and wooed him to dissolve
      it gently.
    </p>
    <p>
      Tom Pinch went on; not fast, but with a sense of rapid motion, which did
      just as well; and as he went, all kinds of things occurred to keep him
      happy. Thus when he came within sight of the turnpike, and was&mdash;oh a
      long way off!&mdash;he saw the tollman&rsquo;s wife, who had that moment checked
      a waggon, run back into the little house again like mad, to say (she knew)
      that Mr Pinch was coming up. And she was right, for when he drew within
      hail of the gate, forth rushed the tollman&rsquo;s children, shrieking in tiny
      chorus, &lsquo;Mr Pinch!&rsquo; to Tom&rsquo;s intense delight. The very tollman, though an
      ugly chap in general, and one whom folks were rather shy of handling, came
      out himself to take the toll, and give him rough good morning; and that
      with all this, and a glimpse of the family breakfast on a little round
      table before the fire, the crust Tom Pinch had brought away with him
      acquired as rich a flavour as though it had been cut from a fairy loaf.
    </p>
    <p>
      But there was more than this. It was not only the married people and the
      children who gave Tom Pinch a welcome as he passed. No, no. Sparkling eyes
      and snowy breasts came hurriedly to many an upper casement as he clattered
      by, and gave him back his greeting: not stinted either, but sevenfold,
      good measure. They were all merry. They all laughed. And some of the
      wickedest among them even kissed their hands as Tom looked back. For who
      minded poor Mr Pinch? There was no harm in <i>him</i>.
    </p>
    <p>
      And now the morning grew so fair, and all things were so wide awake and
      gay, that the sun seeming to say&mdash;Tom had no doubt he said&mdash;&lsquo;I
      can&rsquo;t stand it any longer; I must have a look,&rsquo; streamed out in radiant
      majesty. The mist, too shy and gentle for such lusty company, fled off,
      quite scared, before it; and as it swept away, the hills and mounds and
      distant pasture lands, teeming with placid sheep and noisy crows, came out
      as bright as though they were unrolled bran new for the occasion. In
      compliment to which discovery, the brook stood still no longer, but ran
      briskly off to bear the tidings to the water-mill, three miles away.
    </p>
    <p>
      Mr Pinch was jogging along, full of pleasant thoughts and cheerful
      influences, when he saw, upon the path before him, going in the same
      direction with himself, a traveller on foot, who walked with a light quick
      step, and sang as he went&mdash;for certain in a very loud voice, but not
      unmusically. He was a young fellow, of some five or six-and-twenty
      perhaps, and was dressed in such a free and fly-away fashion, that the
      long ends of his loose red neckcloth were streaming out behind him quite
      as often as before; and the bunch of bright winter berries in the
      buttonhole of his velveteen coat was as visible to Mr Pinch&rsquo;s rearward
      observation, as if he had worn that garment wrong side foremost. He
      continued to sing with so much energy, that he did not hear the sound of
      wheels until it was close behind him; when he turned a whimsical face and
      a very merry pair of blue eyes on Mr Pinch, and checked himself directly.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Why, Mark?&rsquo; said Tom Pinch, stopping. &lsquo;Who&rsquo;d have thought of seeing you
      here? Well! this is surprising!&rsquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      Mark touched his hat, and said, with a very sudden decrease of vivacity,
      that he was going to Salisbury.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;And how spruce you are, too!&rsquo; said Mr Pinch, surveying him with great
      pleasure. &lsquo;Really, I didn&rsquo;t think you were half such a tight-made fellow,
      Mark!&rsquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Thankee, Mr Pinch. Pretty well for that, I believe. It&rsquo;s not my fault,
      you know. With regard to being spruce, sir, that&rsquo;s where it is, you see.&rsquo;
      And here he looked particularly gloomy.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Where what is?&rsquo; Mr Pinch demanded.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Where the aggravation of it is. Any man may be in good spirits and good
      temper when he&rsquo;s well dressed. There an&rsquo;t much credit in that. If I was
      very ragged and very jolly, then I should begin to feel I had gained a
      point, Mr Pinch.&rsquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;So you were singing just now, to bear up, as it were, against being well
      dressed, eh, Mark?&rsquo; said Pinch.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Your conversation&rsquo;s always equal to print, sir,&rsquo; rejoined Mark, with a
      broad grin. &lsquo;That was it.&rsquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Well!&rsquo; cried Pinch, &lsquo;you are the strangest young man, Mark, I ever knew
      in my life. I always thought so; but now I am quite certain of it. I am
      going to Salisbury, too. Will you get in? I shall be very glad of your
      company.&rsquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      The young fellow made his acknowledgments and accepted the offer; stepping
      into the carriage directly, and seating himself on the very edge of the
      seat with his body half out of it, to express his being there on
      sufferance, and by the politeness of Mr Pinch. As they went along, the
      conversation proceeded after this manner.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;I more than half believed, just now, seeing you so very smart,&rsquo; said
      Pinch, &lsquo;that you must be going to be married, Mark.&rsquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Well, sir, I&rsquo;ve thought of that, too,&rsquo; he replied. &lsquo;There might be some
      credit in being jolly with a wife, &lsquo;specially if the children had the
      measles and that, and was very fractious indeed. But I&rsquo;m a&rsquo;most afraid to
      try it. I don&rsquo;t see my way clear.&rsquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;You&rsquo;re not very fond of anybody, perhaps?&rsquo; said Pinch.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Not particular, sir, I think.&rsquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;But the way would be, you know, Mark, according to your views of things,&rsquo;
      said Mr Pinch, &lsquo;to marry somebody you didn&rsquo;t like, and who was very
      disagreeable.&rsquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;So it would, sir; but that might be carrying out a principle a little too
      far, mightn&rsquo;t it?&rsquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Perhaps it might,&rsquo; said Mr Pinch. At which they both laughed gayly.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Lord bless you, sir,&rsquo; said Mark, &lsquo;you don&rsquo;t half know me, though. I don&rsquo;t
      believe there ever was a man as could come out so strong under
      circumstances that would make other men miserable, as I could, if I could
      only get a chance. But I can&rsquo;t get a chance. It&rsquo;s my opinion that nobody
      never will know half of what&rsquo;s in me, unless something very unexpected
      turns up. And I don&rsquo;t see any prospect of that. I&rsquo;m a-going to leave the
      Dragon, sir.&rsquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Going to leave the Dragon!&rsquo; cried Mr Pinch, looking at him with great
      astonishment. &lsquo;Why, Mark, you take my breath away!&rsquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Yes, sir,&rsquo; he rejoined, looking straight before him and a long way off,
      as men do sometimes when they cogitate profoundly. &lsquo;What&rsquo;s the use of my
      stopping at the Dragon? It an&rsquo;t at all the sort of place for <i>me</i>. When I
      left London (I&rsquo;m a Kentish man by birth, though), and took that situation
      here, I quite made up my mind that it was the dullest little
      out-of-the-way corner in England, and that there would be some credit in
      being jolly under such circumstances. But, Lord, there&rsquo;s no dullness at
      the Dragon! Skittles, cricket, quoits, nine-pins, comic songs, choruses,
      company round the chimney corner every winter&rsquo;s evening. Any man could be
      jolly at the Dragon. There&rsquo;s no credit in <i>that</i>.&rsquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;But if common report be true for once, Mark, as I think it is, being able
      to confirm it by what I know myself,&rsquo; said Mr Pinch, &lsquo;you are the cause of
      half this merriment, and set it going.&rsquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;There may be something in that, too, sir,&rsquo; answered Mark. &lsquo;But that&rsquo;s no
      consolation.&rsquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Well!&rsquo; said Mr Pinch, after a short silence, his usually subdued tone
      being even now more subdued than ever. &lsquo;I can hardly think enough of what
      you tell me. Why, what will become of Mrs Lupin, Mark?&rsquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      Mark looked more fixedly before him, and further off still, as he answered
      that he didn&rsquo;t suppose it would be much of an object to her. There were
      plenty of smart young fellows as would be glad of the place. He knew a
      dozen himself.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;That&rsquo;s probable enough,&rsquo; said Mr Pinch, &lsquo;but I am not at all sure that
      Mrs Lupin would be glad of them. Why, I always supposed that Mrs Lupin and
      you would make a match of it, Mark; and so did every one, as far as I
      know.&rsquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;I never,&rsquo; Mark replied, in some confusion, &lsquo;said nothing as was in a
      direct way courting-like to her, nor she to me, but I don&rsquo;t know what I
      mightn&rsquo;t do one of these odd times, and what she mightn&rsquo;t say in answer.
      Well, sir, <i>that </i>wouldn&rsquo;t suit.&rsquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Not to be landlord of the Dragon, Mark?&rsquo; cried Mr Pinch.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;No, sir, certainly not,&rsquo; returned the other, withdrawing his gaze from
      the horizon, and looking at his fellow-traveller. &lsquo;Why that would be the
      ruin of a man like me. I go and sit down comfortably for life, and no man
      never finds me out. What would be the credit of the landlord of the
      Dragon&rsquo;s being jolly? Why, he couldn&rsquo;t help it, if he tried.&rsquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Does Mrs Lupin know you are going to leave her?&rsquo; Mr Pinch inquired.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;I haven&rsquo;t broke it to her yet, sir, but I must. I&rsquo;m looking out this
      morning for something new and suitable,&rsquo; he said, nodding towards the
      city.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;What kind of thing now?&rsquo; Mr Pinch demanded.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;I was thinking,&rsquo; Mark replied, &lsquo;of something in the grave-digging way.&rsquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Good gracious, Mark?&rsquo; cried Mr Pinch.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;It&rsquo;s a good damp, wormy sort of business, sir,&rsquo; said Mark, shaking his
      head argumentatively, &lsquo;and there might be some credit in being jolly, with
      one&rsquo;s mind in that pursuit, unless grave-diggers is usually given that
      way; which would be a drawback. You don&rsquo;t happen to know how that is in
      general, do you, sir?&rsquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;No,&rsquo; said Mr Pinch, &lsquo;I don&rsquo;t indeed. I never thought upon the subject.&rsquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;In case of that not turning out as well as one could wish, you know,&rsquo;
      said Mark, musing again, &lsquo;there&rsquo;s other businesses. Undertaking now.
      That&rsquo;s gloomy. There might be credit to be gained there. A broker&rsquo;s man in
      a poor neighbourhood wouldn&rsquo;t be bad perhaps. A jailor sees a deal of
      misery. A doctor&rsquo;s man is in the very midst of murder. A bailiff&rsquo;s an&rsquo;t a
      lively office nat&rsquo;rally. Even a tax-gatherer must find his feelings rather
      worked upon, at times. There&rsquo;s lots of trades in which I should have an
      opportunity, I think.&rsquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      Mr Pinch was so perfectly overwhelmed by these remarks that he could do
      nothing but occasionally exchange a word or two on some indifferent
      subject, and cast sidelong glances at the bright face of his odd friend
      (who seemed quite unconscious of his observation), until they reached a
      certain corner of the road, close upon the outskirts of the city, when
      Mark said he would jump down there, if he pleased.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;But bless my soul, Mark,&rsquo; said Mr Pinch, who in the progress of his
      observation just then made the discovery that the bosom of his companion&rsquo;s
      shirt was as much exposed as if it was Midsummer, and was ruffled by every
      breath of air, &lsquo;why don&rsquo;t you wear a waistcoat?&rsquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;What&rsquo;s the good of one, sir?&rsquo; asked Mark.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Good of one?&rsquo; said Mr Pinch. &lsquo;Why, to keep your chest warm.&rsquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Lord love you, sir!&rsquo; cried Mark, &lsquo;you don&rsquo;t know me. My chest don&rsquo;t want
      no warming. Even if it did, what would no waistcoat bring it to?
      Inflammation of the lungs, perhaps? Well, there&rsquo;d be some credit in being
      jolly, with a inflammation of the lungs.&rsquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      As Mr Pinch returned no other answer than such as was conveyed in his
      breathing very hard, and opening his eyes very wide, and nodding his head
      very much, Mark thanked him for his ride, and without troubling him to
      stop, jumped lightly down. And away he fluttered, with his red
      neckerchief, and his open coat, down a cross-lane; turning back from time
      to time to nod to Mr Pinch, and looking one of the most careless,
      good-humoured comical fellows in life. His late companion, with a
      thoughtful face pursued his way to Salisbury.
    </p>
    <p>
      Mr Pinch had a shrewd notion that Salisbury was a very desperate sort of
      place; an exceeding wild and dissipated city; and when he had put up the
      horse, and given the hostler to understand that he would look in again in
      the course of an hour or two to see him take his corn, he set forth on a
      stroll about the streets with a vague and not unpleasant idea that they
      teemed with all kinds of mystery and bedevilment. To one of his quiet
      habits this little delusion was greatly assisted by the circumstance of
      its being market-day, and the thoroughfares about the market-place being
      filled with carts, horses, donkeys, baskets, waggons, garden-stuff, meat,
      tripe, pies, poultry and huckster&rsquo;s wares of every opposite description
      and possible variety of character. Then there were young farmers and old
      farmers with smock-frocks, brown great-coats, drab great-coats, red
      worsted comforters, leather-leggings, wonderful shaped hats,
      hunting-whips, and rough sticks, standing about in groups, or talking
      noisily together on the tavern steps, or paying and receiving huge amounts
      of greasy wealth, with the assistance of such bulky pocket-books that when
      they were in their pockets it was apoplexy to get them out, and when they
      were out it was spasms to get them in again. Also there were farmers&rsquo;
      wives in beaver bonnets and red cloaks, riding shaggy horses purged of all
      earthly passions, who went soberly into all manner of places without
      desiring to know why, and who, if required, would have stood stock still
      in a china shop, with a complete dinner-service at each hoof. Also a great
      many dogs, who were strongly interested in the state of the market and the
      bargains of their masters; and a great confusion of tongues, both brute
      and human.
    </p>
    <p>
      Mr Pinch regarded everything exposed for sale with great delight, and was
      particularly struck by the itinerant cutlery, which he considered of the
      very keenest kind, insomuch that he purchased a pocket knife with seven
      blades in it, and not a cut (as he afterwards found out) among them. When
      he had exhausted the market-place, and watched the farmers safe into the
      market dinner, he went back to look after the horse. Having seen him eat
      unto his heart&rsquo;s content he issued forth again, to wander round the town
      and regale himself with the shop windows; previously taking a long stare
      at the bank, and wondering in what direction underground the caverns might
      be where they kept the money; and turning to look back at one or two young
      men who passed him, whom he knew to be articled to solicitors in the town;
      and who had a sort of fearful interest in his eyes, as jolly dogs who knew
      a thing or two, and kept it up tremendously.
    </p>
    <p>
      But the shops. First of all there were the jewellers&rsquo; shops, with all the
      treasures of the earth displayed therein, and such large silver watches
      hanging up in every pane of glass, that if they were anything but
      first-rate goers it certainly was not because the works could decently
      complain of want of room. In good sooth they were big enough, and perhaps,
      as the saying is, ugly enough, to be the most correct of all mechanical
      performers; in Mr Pinch&rsquo;s eyes, however they were smaller than Geneva
      ware; and when he saw one very bloated watch announced as a repeater,
      gifted with the uncommon power of striking every quarter of an hour inside
      the pocket of its happy owner, he almost wished that he were rich enough
      to buy it.
    </p>
    <p>
      But what were even gold and silver, precious stones and clockwork, to the
      bookshops, whence a pleasant smell of paper freshly pressed came issuing
      forth, awakening instant recollections of some new grammar had at school,
      long time ago, with &lsquo;Master Pinch, Grove House Academy,&rsquo; inscribed in
      faultless writing on the fly-leaf! That whiff of russia leather, too, and
      all those rows on rows of volumes neatly ranged within&mdash;what
      happiness did they suggest! And in the window were the spick-and-span new
      works from London, with the title-pages, and sometimes even the first page
      of the first chapter, laid wide open; tempting unwary men to begin to read
      the book, and then, in the impossibility of turning over, to rush blindly
      in, and buy it! Here too were the dainty frontispiece and trim vignette,
      pointing like handposts on the outskirts of great cities, to the rich
      stock of incident beyond; and store of books, with many a grave portrait
      and time-honoured name, whose matter he knew well, and would have given
      mines to have, in any form, upon the narrow shell beside his bed at Mr
      Pecksniff&rsquo;s. What a heart-breaking shop it was!
    </p>
    <p>
      There was another; not quite so bad at first, but still a trying shop;
      where children&rsquo;s books were sold, and where poor Robinson Crusoe stood
      alone in his might, with dog and hatchet, goat-skin cap and
      fowling-pieces; calmly surveying Philip Quarn and the host of imitators
      round him, and calling Mr Pinch to witness that he, of all the crowd,
      impressed one solitary footprint on the shore of boyish memory, whereof
      the tread of generations should not stir the lightest grain of sand. And
      there too were the Persian tales, with flying chests and students of
      enchanted books shut up for years in caverns; and there too was Abudah,
      the merchant, with the terrible little old woman hobbling out of the box
      in his bedroom; and there the mighty talisman, the rare Arabian Nights,
      with Cassim Baba, divided by four, like the ghost of a dreadful sum,
      hanging up, all gory, in the robbers&rsquo; cave. Which matchless wonders,
      coming fast on Mr Pinch&rsquo;s mind, did so rub up and chafe that wonderful
      lamp within him, that when he turned his face towards the busy street, a
      crowd of phantoms waited on his pleasure, and he lived again, with new
      delight, the happy days before the Pecksniff era.
    </p>
    <p>
      He had less interest now in the chemists&rsquo; shops, with their great glowing
      bottles (with smaller repositories of brightness in their very stoppers);
      and in their agreeable compromises between medicine and perfumery, in the
      shape of toothsome lozenges and virgin honey. Neither had he the least
      regard (but he never had much) for the tailors&rsquo;, where the newest
      metropolitan waistcoat patterns were hanging up, which by some strange
      transformation always looked amazing there, and never appeared at all like
      the same thing anywhere else. But he stopped to read the playbill at the
      theatre and surveyed the doorway with a kind of awe, which was not
      diminished when a sallow gentleman with long dark hair came out, and told
      a boy to run home to his lodgings and bring down his broadsword. Mr Pinch
      stood rooted to the spot on hearing this, and might have stood there until
      dark, but that the old cathedral bell began to ring for vesper service, on
      which he tore himself away.
    </p>
    <p>
      Now, the organist&rsquo;s assistant was a friend of Mr Pinch&rsquo;s, which was a good
      thing, for he too was a very quiet gentle soul, and had been, like Tom, a
      kind of old-fashioned boy at school, though well liked by the noisy fellow
      too. As good luck would have it (Tom always said he had great good luck)
      the assistant chanced that very afternoon to be on duty by himself, with
      no one in the dusty organ loft but Tom; so while he played, Tom helped him
      with the stops; and finally, the service being just over, Tom took the
      organ himself. It was then turning dark, and the yellow light that
      streamed in through the ancient windows in the choir was mingled with a
      murky red. As the grand tones resounded through the church, they seemed,
      to Tom, to find an echo in the depth of every ancient tomb, no less than
      in the deep mystery of his own heart. Great thoughts and hopes came
      crowding on his mind as the rich music rolled upon the air and yet among
      them&mdash;something more grave and solemn in their purpose, but the same&mdash;were
      all the images of that day, down to its very lightest recollection of
      childhood. The feeling that the sounds awakened, in the moment of their
      existence, seemed to include his whole life and being; and as the
      surrounding realities of stone and wood and glass grew dimmer in the
      darkness, these visions grew so much the brighter that Tom might have
      forgotten the new pupil and the expectant master, and have sat there
      pouring out his grateful heart till midnight, but for a very earthy old
      verger insisting on locking up the cathedral forthwith. So he took leave
      of his friend, with many thanks, groped his way out, as well as he could,
      into the now lamp-lighted streets, and hurried off to get his dinner.
    </p>
    <p>
      All the farmers being by this time jogging homewards, there was nobody in
      the sanded parlour of the tavern where he had left the horse; so he had
      his little table drawn out close before the fire, and fell to work upon a
      well-cooked steak and smoking hot potatoes, with a strong appreciation of
      their excellence, and a very keen sense of enjoyment. Beside him, too,
      there stood a jug of most stupendous Wiltshire beer; and the effect of the
      whole was so transcendent, that he was obliged every now and then to lay
      down his knife and fork, rub his hands, and think about it. By the time
      the cheese and celery came, Mr Pinch had taken a book out of his pocket,
      and could afford to trifle with the viands; now eating a little, now
      drinking a little, now reading a little, and now stopping to wonder what
      sort of a young man the new pupil would turn out to be. He had passed from
      this latter theme and was deep in his book again, when the door opened,
      and another guest came in, bringing with him such a quantity of cold air,
      that he positively seemed at first to put the fire out.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Very hard frost to-night, sir,&rsquo; said the newcomer, courteously
      acknowledging Mr Pinch&rsquo;s withdrawal of the little table, that he might
      have place: &lsquo;Don&rsquo;t disturb yourself, I beg.&rsquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      Though he said this with a vast amount of consideration for Mr Pinch&rsquo;s
      comfort, he dragged one of the great leather-bottomed chairs to the very
      centre of the hearth, notwithstanding; and sat down in front of the fire,
      with a foot on each hob.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;My feet are quite numbed. Ah! Bitter cold to be sure.&rsquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;You have been in the air some considerable time, I dare say?&rsquo; said Mr
      Pinch.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;All day. Outside a coach, too.&rsquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;That accounts for his making the room so cool,&rsquo; thought Mr Pinch. &lsquo;Poor
      fellow! How thoroughly chilled he must be!&rsquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      The stranger became thoughtful likewise, and sat for five or ten minutes
      looking at the fire in silence. At length he rose and divested himself of
      his shawl and great-coat, which (far different from Mr Pinch&rsquo;s) was a very
      warm and thick one; but he was not a whit more conversational out of his
      great-coat than in it, for he sat down again in the same place and
      attitude, and leaning back in his chair, began to bite his nails. He was
      young&mdash;one-and-twenty, perhaps&mdash;and handsome; with a keen dark
      eye, and a quickness of look and manner which made Tom sensible of a great
      contrast in his own bearing, and caused him to feel even more shy than
      usual.
    </p>
    <p>
      There was a clock in the room, which the stranger often turned to look at.
      Tom made frequent reference to it also; partly from a nervous sympathy
      with its taciturn companion; and partly because the new pupil was to
      inquire for him at half after six, and the hands were getting on towards
      that hour. Whenever the stranger caught him looking at this clock, a kind
      of confusion came upon Tom as if he had been found out in something; and
      it was a perception of his uneasiness which caused the younger man to say,
      perhaps, with a smile:
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;We both appear to be rather particular about the time. The fact is, I
      have an engagement to meet a gentleman here.&rsquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;So have I,&rsquo; said Mr Pinch.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;At half-past six,&rsquo; said the stranger.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;At half-past six,&rsquo; said Tom in the very same breath; whereupon the other
      looked at him with some surprise.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;The young gentleman, I expect,&rsquo; remarked Tom, timidly, &lsquo;was to inquire at
      that time for a person by the name of Pinch.&rsquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Dear me!&rsquo; cried the other, jumping up. &lsquo;And I have been keeping the fire
      from you all this while! I had no idea you were Mr Pinch. I am the Mr
      Martin for whom you were to inquire. Pray excuse me. How do you do? Oh, do
      draw nearer, pray!&rsquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Thank you,&rsquo; said Tom, &lsquo;thank you. I am not at all cold, and you are; and
      we have a cold ride before us. Well, if you wish it, I will. I&mdash;I am
      very glad,&rsquo; said Tom, smiling with an embarrassed frankness peculiarly
      his, and which was as plainly a confession of his own imperfections, and
      an appeal to the kindness of the person he addressed, as if he had drawn
      one up in simple language and committed it to paper: &lsquo;I am very glad
      indeed that you turn out to be the party I expected. I was thinking, but a
      minute ago, that I could wish him to be like you.&rsquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;I am very glad to hear it,&rsquo; returned Martin, shaking hands with him
      again; &lsquo;for I assure you, I was thinking there could be no such luck as Mr
      Pinch&rsquo;s turning out like you.&rsquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;No, really!&rsquo; said Tom, with great pleasure. &lsquo;Are you serious?&rsquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Upon my word I am,&rsquo; replied his new acquaintance. &lsquo;You and I will get on
      excellently well, I know; which it&rsquo;s no small relief to me to feel, for to
      tell you the truth, I am not at all the sort of fellow who could get on
      with everybody, and that&rsquo;s the point on which I had the greatest doubts.
      But they&rsquo;re quite relieved now.&mdash;Do me the favour to ring the bell,
      will you?&rsquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      Mr Pinch rose, and complied with great alacrity&mdash;the handle hung just
      over Martin&rsquo;s head, as he warmed himself&mdash;and listened with a smiling
      face to what his friend went on to say. It was:
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;If you like punch, you&rsquo;ll allow me to order a glass apiece, as hot as it
      can be made, that we may usher in our friendship in a becoming manner. To
      let you into a secret, Mr Pinch, I never was so much in want of something
      warm and cheering in my life; but I didn&rsquo;t like to run the chance of being
      found drinking it, without knowing what kind of person you were; for first
      impressions, you know, often go a long way, and last a long time.&rsquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      Mr Pinch assented, and the punch was ordered. In due course it came; hot
      and strong. After drinking to each other in the steaming mixture, they
      became quite confidential.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;I&rsquo;m a sort of relation of Pecksniff&rsquo;s, you know,&rsquo; said the young man.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Indeed!&rsquo; cried Mr Pinch.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Yes. My grandfather is his cousin, so he&rsquo;s kith and kin to me, somehow,
      if you can make that out. I can&rsquo;t.&rsquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Then Martin is your Christian name?&rsquo; said Mr Pinch, thoughtfully. &lsquo;Oh!&rsquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Of course it is,&rsquo; returned his friend: &lsquo;I wish it was my surname for my
      own is not a very pretty one, and it takes a long time to sign. Chuzzlewit
      is my name.&rsquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Dear me!&rsquo; cried Mr Pinch, with an involuntary start.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;You&rsquo;re not surprised at my having two names, I suppose?&rsquo; returned the
      other, setting his glass to his lips. &lsquo;Most people have.&rsquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Oh, no,&rsquo; said Mr Pinch, &lsquo;not at all. Oh dear no! Well!&rsquo; And then
      remembering that Mr Pecksniff had privately cautioned him to say nothing
      in reference to the old gentleman of the same name who had lodged at the
      Dragon, but to reserve all mention of that person for him, he had no
      better means of hiding his confusion than by raising his own glass to his
      mouth. They looked at each other out of their respective tumblers for a
      few seconds, and then put them down empty.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;I told them in the stable to be ready for us ten minutes ago,&rsquo; said Mr
      Pinch, glancing at the clock again. &lsquo;Shall we go?&rsquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;If you please,&rsquo; returned the other.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Would you like to drive?&rsquo; said Mr Pinch; his whole face beaming with a
      consciousness of the splendour of his offer. &lsquo;You shall, if you wish.&rsquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Why, that depends, Mr Pinch,&rsquo; said Martin, laughing, &lsquo;upon what sort of a
      horse you have. Because if he&rsquo;s a bad one, I would rather keep my hands
      warm by holding them comfortably in my greatcoat pockets.&rsquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      He appeared to think this such a good joke, that Mr Pinch was quite sure
      it must be a capital one. Accordingly, he laughed too, and was fully
      persuaded that he enjoyed it very much. Then he settled his bill, and Mr
      Chuzzlewit paid for the punch; and having wrapped themselves up, to the
      extent of their respective means, they went out together to the front
      door, where Mr Pecksniff&rsquo;s property stopped the way.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;I won&rsquo;t drive, thank you, Mr Pinch,&rsquo; said Martin, getting into the
      sitter&rsquo;s place. &lsquo;By the bye, there&rsquo;s a box of mine. Can we manage to take
      it?&rsquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Oh, certainly,&rsquo; said Tom. &lsquo;Put it in, Dick, anywhere!&rsquo;
    </p>

<div class="fig" style="width:65%">
      <img src="images/20117m.jpg" alt="20117m " width="100%" /><br />
    </div>
    <h5>
      <a href="images/20117.jpg"><i>Original</i></a>
    </h5>

    <p>
      It was not precisely of that convenient size which would admit of its
      being squeezed into any odd corner, but Dick the hostler got it in
      somehow, and Mr Chuzzlewit helped him. It was all on Mr Pinch&rsquo;s side, and
      Mr Chuzzlewit said he was very much afraid it would encumber him; to which
      Tom said, &lsquo;Not at all;&rsquo; though it forced him into such an awkward
      position, that he had much ado to see anything but his own knees. But it
      is an ill wind that blows nobody any good; and the wisdom of the saying
      was verified in this instance; for the cold air came from Mr Pinch&rsquo;s side
      of the carriage, and by interposing a perfect wall of box and man between
      it and the new pupil, he shielded that young gentleman effectually; which
      was a great comfort.
    </p>
    <p>
      It was a clear evening, with a bright moon. The whole landscape was
      silvered by its light and by the hoar-frost; and everything looked
      exquisitely beautiful. At first, the great serenity and peace through
      which they travelled, disposed them both to silence; but in a very short
      time the punch within them and the healthful air without, made them
      loquacious, and they talked incessantly. When they were halfway home, and
      stopped to give the horse some water, Martin (who was very generous with
      his money) ordered another glass of punch, which they drank between them,
      and which had not the effect of making them less conversational than
      before. Their principal topic of discourse was naturally Mr Pecksniff and
      his family; of whom, and of the great obligations they had heaped upon
      him, Tom Pinch, with the tears standing in his eyes, drew such a picture
      as would have inclined any one of common feeling almost to revere them;
      and of which Mr Pecksniff had not the slightest foresight or preconceived
      idea, or he certainly (being very humble) would not have sent Tom Pinch to
      bring the pupil home.
    </p>
    <p>
      In this way they went on, and on, and on&mdash;in the language of the
      story-books&mdash;until at last the village lights appeared before them,
      and the church spire cast a long reflection on the graveyard grass; as if
      it were a dial (alas, the truest in the world!) marking, whatever light
      shone out of Heaven, the flight of days and weeks and years, by some new
      shadow on that solemn ground.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;A pretty church!&rsquo; said Martin, observing that his companion slackened the
      slack pace of the horse, as they approached.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Is it not?&rsquo; cried Tom, with great pride. &lsquo;There&rsquo;s the sweetest little
      organ there you ever heard. I play it for them.&rsquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Indeed?&rsquo; said Martin. &lsquo;It is hardly worth the trouble, I should think.
      What do you get for that, now?&rsquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Nothing,&rsquo; answered Tom.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Well,&rsquo; returned his friend, &lsquo;you <i>are </i>a very strange fellow!&rsquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      To which remark there succeeded a brief silence.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;When I say nothing,&rsquo; observed Mr Pinch, cheerfully, &lsquo;I am wrong, and
      don&rsquo;t say what I mean, because I get a great deal of pleasure from it, and
      the means of passing some of the happiest hours I know. It led to
      something else the other day; but you will not care to hear about that I
      dare say?&rsquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Oh yes I shall. What?&rsquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;It led to my seeing,&rsquo; said Tom, in a lower voice, &lsquo;one of the loveliest
      and most beautiful faces you can possibly picture to yourself.&rsquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;And yet I am able to picture a beautiful one,&rsquo; said his friend,
      thoughtfully, &lsquo;or should be, if I have any memory.&rsquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;She came&rsquo; said Tom, laying his hand upon the other&rsquo;s arm, &lsquo;for the first
      time very early in the morning, when it was hardly light; and when I saw
      her, over my shoulder, standing just within the porch, I turned quite
      cold, almost believing her to be a spirit. A moment&rsquo;s reflection got the
      better of that, of course, and fortunately it came to my relief so soon,
      that I didn&rsquo;t leave off playing.&rsquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Why fortunately?&rsquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Why? Because she stood there, listening. I had my spectacles on, and saw
      her through the chinks in the curtains as plainly as I see you; and she
      was beautiful. After a while she glided off, and I continued to play until
      she was out of hearing.&rsquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Why did you do that?&rsquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Don&rsquo;t you see?&rsquo; responded Tom. &lsquo;Because she might suppose I hadn&rsquo;t seen
      her; and might return.&rsquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;And did she?&rsquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Certainly she did. Next morning, and next evening too; but always when
      there were no people about, and always alone. I rose earlier and sat there
      later, that when she came, she might find the church door open, and the
      organ playing, and might not be disappointed. She strolled that way for
      some days, and always stayed to listen. But she is gone now, and of all
      unlikely things in this wide world, it is perhaps the most improbable that
      I shall ever look upon her face again.&rsquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;You don&rsquo;t know anything more about her?&rsquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;No.&rsquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;And you never followed her when she went away?&rsquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Why should I distress her by doing that?&rsquo; said Tom Pinch. &lsquo;Is it likely
      that she wanted my company? She came to hear the organ, not to see me; and
      would you have had me scare her from a place she seemed to grow quite fond
      of? Now, Heaven bless her!&rsquo; cried Tom, &lsquo;to have given her but a minute&rsquo;s
      pleasure every day, I would have gone on playing the organ at those times
      until I was an old man; quite contented if she sometimes thought of a poor
      fellow like me, as a part of the music; and more than recompensed if she
      ever mixed me up with anything she liked as well as she liked that!&rsquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      The new pupil was clearly very much amazed by Mr Pinch&rsquo;s weakness, and
      would probably have told him so, and given him some good advice, but for
      their opportune arrival at Mr Pecksniff&rsquo;s door; the front door this time,
      on account of the occasion being one of ceremony and rejoicing. The same
      man was in waiting for the horse who had been adjured by Mr Pinch in the
      morning not to yield to his rabid desire to start; and after delivering
      the animal into his charge, and beseeching Mr Chuzzlewit in a whisper
      never to reveal a syllable of what he had just told him in the fullness of
      his heart, Tom led the pupil in, for instant presentation.
    </p>
    <p>
      Mr Pecksniff had clearly not expected them for hours to come; for he was
      surrounded by open books, and was glancing from volume to volume, with a
      black lead-pencil in his mouth, and a pair of compasses in his hand, at a
      vast number of mathematical diagrams, of such extraordinary shapes that
      they looked like designs for fireworks. Neither had Miss Charity expected
      them, for she was busied, with a capacious wicker basket before her, in
      making impracticable nightcaps for the poor. Neither had Miss Mercy
      expected them, for she was sitting upon her stool, tying on the&mdash;oh
      good gracious!&mdash;the petticoat of a large doll that she was dressing
      for a neighbour&rsquo;s child&mdash;really, quite a grown-up doll, which made it
      more confusing&mdash;and had its little bonnet dangling by the ribbon from
      one of her fair curls, to which she had fastened it lest it should be lost
      or sat upon. It would be difficult, if not impossible, to conceive a
      family so thoroughly taken by surprise as the Pecksniffs were, on this
      occasion.
    </p>
    <p>
      Bless my life!&rsquo; said Mr Pecksniff, looking up, and gradually exchanging
      his abstracted face for one of joyful recognition. &lsquo;Here already! Martin,
      my dear boy, I am delighted to welcome you to my poor house!&rsquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      With this kind greeting, Mr Pecksniff fairly took him to his arms, and
      patted him several times upon the back with his right hand the while, as
      if to express that his feelings during the embrace were too much for
      utterance.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;But here,&rsquo; he said, recovering, &lsquo;are my daughters, Martin; my two only
      children, whom (if you ever saw them) you have not beheld&mdash;ah, these
      sad family divisions!&mdash;since you were infants together. Nay, my
      dears, why blush at being detected in your everyday pursuits? We had
      prepared to give you the reception of a visitor, Martin, in our little
      room of state,&rsquo; said Mr Pecksniff, smiling, &lsquo;but I like this better, I
      like this better!&rsquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      Oh blessed star of Innocence, wherever you may be, how did you glitter in
      your home of ether, when the two Miss Pecksniffs put forth each her lily
      hand, and gave the same, with mantling cheeks, to Martin! How did you
      twinkle, as if fluttering with sympathy, when Mercy, reminded of the
      bonnet in her hair, hid her fair face and turned her head aside; the while
      her gentle sister plucked it out, and smote her with a sister&rsquo;s soft
      reproof, upon her buxom shoulder!
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;And how,&rsquo; said Mr Pecksniff, turning round after the contemplation of
      these passages, and taking Mr Pinch in a friendly manner by the elbow,
      &lsquo;how has our friend used you, Martin?&rsquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Very well indeed, sir. We are on the best terms, I assure you.&rsquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Old Tom Pinch!&rsquo; said Mr Pecksniff, looking on him with affectionate
      sadness. &lsquo;Ah! It seems but yesterday that Thomas was a boy fresh from a
      scholastic course. Yet years have passed, I think, since Thomas Pinch and
      I first walked the world together!&rsquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      Mr Pinch could say nothing. He was too much moved. But he pressed his
      master&rsquo;s hand, and tried to thank him.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;And Thomas Pinch and I,&rsquo; said Mr Pecksniff, in a deeper voice, &lsquo;will walk
      it yet, in mutual faithfulness and friendship! And if it comes to pass
      that either of us be run over in any of those busy crossings which divide
      the streets of life, the other will convey him to the hospital in Hope,
      and sit beside his bed in Bounty!&rsquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Well, well, well!&rsquo; he added in a happier tone, as he shook Mr Pinch&rsquo;s
      elbow hard. &lsquo;No more of this! Martin, my dear friend, that you may be at
      home within these walls, let me show you how we live, and where. Come!&rsquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      With that he took up a lighted candle, and, attended by his young
      relative, prepared to leave the room. At the door, he stopped.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;You&rsquo;ll bear us company, Tom Pinch?&rsquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      Aye, cheerfully, though it had been to death, would Tom have followed him;
      glad to lay down his life for such a man!
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;This,&rsquo; said Mr Pecksniff, opening the door of an opposite parlour, &lsquo;is
      the little room of state, I mentioned to you. My girls have pride in it,
      Martin! This,&rsquo; opening another door, &lsquo;is the little chamber in which my
      works (slight things at best) have been concocted. Portrait of myself by
      Spiller. Bust by Spoker. The latter is considered a good likeness. I seem
      to recognize something about the left-hand corner of the nose, myself.&rsquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      Martin thought it was very like, but scarcely intellectual enough. Mr
      Pecksniff observed that the same fault had been found with it before. It
      was remarkable it should have struck his young relation too. He was glad
      to see he had an eye for art.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Various books you observe,&rsquo; said Mr Pecksniff, waving his hand towards
      the wall, &lsquo;connected with our pursuit. I have scribbled myself, but have
      not yet published. Be careful how you come upstairs. This,&rsquo; opening
      another door, &lsquo;is my chamber. I read here when the family suppose I have
      retired to rest. Sometimes I injure my health rather more than I can quite
      justify to myself, by doing so; but art is long and time is short. Every
      facility you see for jotting down crude notions, even here.&rsquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      These latter words were explained by his pointing to a small round table
      on which were a lamp, divers sheets of paper, a piece of India rubber, and
      a case of instruments; all put ready, in case an architectural idea should
      come into Mr Pecksniff&rsquo;s head in the night; in which event he would
      instantly leap out of bed, and fix it for ever.
    </p>
    <p>
      Mr Pecksniff opened another door on the same floor, and shut it again, all
      at once, as if it were a Blue Chamber. But before he had well done so, he
      looked smilingly round, and said, &lsquo;Why not?&rsquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      Martin couldn&rsquo;t say why not, because he didn&rsquo;t know anything at all about
      it. So Mr Pecksniff answered himself, by throwing open the door, and
      saying:
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;My daughters&rsquo; room. A poor first-floor to us, but a bower to them. Very
      neat. Very airy. Plants you observe; hyacinths; books again; birds.&rsquo; These
      birds, by the bye, comprised, in all, one staggering old sparrow without a
      tail, which had been borrowed expressly from the kitchen. &lsquo;Such trifles as
      girls love are here. Nothing more. Those who seek heartless splendour,
      would seek here in vain.&rsquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      With that he led them to the floor above.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;This,&rsquo; said Mr Pecksniff, throwing wide the door of the memorable
      two-pair front; &lsquo;is a room where some talent has been developed I believe.
      This is a room in which an idea for a steeple occurred to me that I may
      one day give to the world. We work here, my dear Martin. Some architects
      have been bred in this room; a few, I think, Mr Pinch?&rsquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      Tom fully assented; and, what is more, fully believed it.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;You see,&rsquo; said Mr Pecksniff, passing the candle rapidly from roll to roll
      of paper, &lsquo;some traces of our doings here. Salisbury Cathedral from the
      north. From the south. From the east. From the west. From the south-east.
      From the nor&rsquo;west. A bridge. An almshouse. A jail. A church. A
      powder-magazine. A wine-cellar. A portico. A summer-house. An ice-house.
      Plans, elevations, sections, every kind of thing. And this,&rsquo; he added,
      having by this time reached another large chamber on the same story, with
      four little beds in it, &lsquo;this is your room, of which Mr Pinch here is the
      quiet sharer. A southern aspect; a charming prospect; Mr Pinch&rsquo;s little
      library, you perceive; everything agreeable and appropriate. If there is
      any additional comfort you would desire to have here at anytime, pray
      mention it. Even to strangers, far less to you, my dear Martin, there is
      no restriction on that point.&rsquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      It was undoubtedly true, and may be stated in corroboration of Mr
      Pecksniff, that any pupil had the most liberal permission to mention
      anything in this way that suggested itself to his fancy. Some young
      gentlemen had gone on mentioning the very same thing for five years
      without ever being stopped.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;The domestic assistants,&rsquo; said Mr Pecksniff, &lsquo;sleep above; and that is
      all.&rsquo; After which, and listening complacently as he went, to the encomiums
      passed by his young friend on the arrangements generally, he led the way
      to the parlour again.
    </p>
    <p>
      Here a great change had taken place; for festive preparations on a rather
      extensive scale were already completed, and the two Miss Pecksniffs were
      awaiting their return with hospitable looks. There were two bottles of
      currant wine, white and red; a dish of sandwiches (very long and very
      slim); another of apples; another of captain&rsquo;s biscuits (which are always
      a moist and jovial sort of viand); a plate of oranges cut up small and
      gritty; with powdered sugar, and a highly geological home-made cake. The
      magnitude of these preparations quite took away Tom Pinch&rsquo;s breath; for
      though the new pupils were usually let down softly, as one may say,
      particularly in the wine department, which had so many stages of
      declension, that sometimes a young gentleman was a whole fortnight in
      getting to the pump; still this was a banquet; a sort of Lord Mayor&rsquo;s
      feast in private life; a something to think of, and hold on by,
      afterwards.
    </p>
    <p>
      To this entertainment, which apart from its own intrinsic merits, had the
      additional choice quality, that it was in strict keeping with the night,
      being both light and cool, Mr Pecksniff besought the company to do full
      justice.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Martin,&rsquo; he said, &lsquo;will seat himself between you two, my dears, and Mr
      Pinch will come by me. Let us drink to our new inmate, and may we be happy
      together! Martin, my dear friend, my love to you! Mr Pinch, if you spare
      the bottle we shall quarrel.&rsquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      And trying (in his regard for the feelings of the rest) to look as if the
      wine were not acid and didn&rsquo;t make him wink, Mr Pecksniff did honour to
      his own toast.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;This,&rsquo; he said, in allusion to the party, not the wine, &lsquo;is a mingling
      that repays one for much disappointment and vexation. Let us be merry.&rsquo;
      Here he took a captain&rsquo;s biscuit. &lsquo;It is a poor heart that never rejoices;
      and our hearts are not poor. No!&rsquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      With such stimulants to merriment did he beguile the time, and do the
      honours of the table; while Mr Pinch, perhaps to assure himself that what
      he saw and heard was holiday reality, and not a charming dream, ate of
      everything, and in particular disposed of the slim sandwiches to a
      surprising extent. Nor was he stinted in his draughts of wine; but on the
      contrary, remembering Mr Pecksniff&rsquo;s speech, attacked the bottle with such
      vigour, that every time he filled his glass anew, Miss Charity, despite
      her amiable resolves, could not repress a fixed and stony glare, as if her
      eyes had rested on a ghost. Mr Pecksniff also became thoughtful at those
      moments, not to say dejected; but as he knew the vintage, it is very
      likely he may have been speculating on the probable condition of Mr Pinch
      upon the morrow, and discussing within himself the best remedies for
      colic.
    </p>
    <p>
      Martin and the young ladies were excellent friends already, and compared
      recollections of their childish days, to their mutual liveliness and
      entertainment. Miss Mercy laughed immensely at everything that was said;
      and sometimes, after glancing at the happy face of Mr Pinch, was seized
      with such fits of mirth as brought her to the very confines of hysterics.
      But for these bursts of gaiety, her sister, in her better sense, reproved
      her; observing, in an angry whisper, that it was far from being a theme
      for jest; and that she had no patience with the creature; though it
      generally ended in her laughing too&mdash;but much more moderately&mdash;and
      saying that indeed it was a little too ridiculous and intolerable to be
      serious about.
    </p>
    <p>
      At length it became high time to remember the first clause of that great
      discovery made by the ancient philosopher, for securing health, riches,
      and wisdom; the infallibility of which has been for generations verified
      by the enormous fortunes constantly amassed by chimney-sweepers and other
      persons who get up early and go to bed betimes. The young ladies
      accordingly rose, and having taken leave of Mr Chuzzlewit with much
      sweetness, and of their father with much duty and of Mr Pinch with much
      condescension, retired to their bower. Mr Pecksniff insisted on
      accompanying his young friend upstairs for personal superintendence of his
      comforts; and taking him by the arm, conducted him once more to his
      bedroom, followed by Mr Pinch, who bore the light.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Mr Pinch,&rsquo; said Pecksniff, seating himself with folded arms on one of the
      spare beds. &lsquo;I don&rsquo;t see any snuffers in that candlestick. Will you oblige
      me by going down, and asking for a pair?&rsquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      Mr Pinch, only too happy to be useful, went off directly.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;You will excuse Thomas Pinch&rsquo;s want of polish, Martin,&rsquo; said Mr
      Pecksniff, with a smile of patronage and pity, as soon as he had left the
      room. &lsquo;He means well.&rsquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;He is a very good fellow, sir.&rsquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Oh, yes,&rsquo; said Mr Pecksniff. &lsquo;Yes. Thomas Pinch means well. He is very
      grateful. I have never regretted having befriended Thomas Pinch.&rsquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;I should think you never would, sir.&rsquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;No,&rsquo; said Mr Pecksniff. &lsquo;No. I hope not. Poor fellow, he is always
      disposed to do his best; but he is not gifted. You will make him useful to
      you, Martin, if you please. If Thomas has a fault, it is that he is
      sometimes a little apt to forget his position. But that is soon checked.
      Worthy soul! You will find him easy to manage. Good night!&rsquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Good night, sir.&rsquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      By this time Mr Pinch had returned with the snuffers.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;And good night to <i>you</i>, Mr Pinch,&rsquo; said Pecksniff. &lsquo;And sound sleep to you
      both. Bless you! Bless you!&rsquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      Invoking this benediction on the heads of his young friends with great
      fervour, he withdrew to his own room; while they, being tired, soon fell
      asleep. If Martin dreamed at all, some clue to the matter of his visions
      may possibly be gathered from the after-pages of this history. Those of
      Thomas Pinch were all of holidays, church organs, and seraphic Pecksniffs.
      It was some time before Mr Pecksniff dreamed at all, or even sought his
      pillow, as he sat for full two hours before the fire in his own chamber,
      looking at the coals and thinking deeply. But he, too, slept and dreamed
      at last. Thus in the quiet hours of the night, one house shuts in as many
      incoherent and incongruous fancies as a madman&rsquo;s head.

      CHAPTER SIX
    </h2>
    <p>
      COMPRISES, AMONG OTHER IMPORTANT MATTERS, PECKSNIFFIAN AND ARCHITECTURAL,
      AND EXACT RELATION OF THE PROGRESS MADE BY MR PINCH IN THE CONFIDENCE AND
      FRIENDSHIP OF THE NEW PUPIL
    </p>
    <p>
      It was morning; and the beautiful Aurora, of whom so much hath been
      written, said, and sung, did, with her rosy fingers, nip and tweak Miss
      Pecksniff&rsquo;s nose. It was the frolicsome custom of the Goddess, in her
      intercourse with the fair Cherry, so to do; or in more prosaic phrase, the
      tip of that feature in the sweet girl&rsquo;s countenance was always very red at
      breakfast-time. For the most part, indeed, it wore, at that season of the
      day, a scraped and frosty look, as if it had been rasped; while a similar
      phenomenon developed itself in her humour, which was then observed to be
      of a sharp and acid quality, as though an extra lemon (figuratively
      speaking) had been squeezed into the nectar of her disposition, and had
      rather damaged its flavour.
    </p>
    <p>
      This additional pungency on the part of the fair young creature led, on
      ordinary occasions, to such slight consequences as the copious dilution of
      Mr Pinch&rsquo;s tea, or to his coming off uncommonly short in respect of
      butter, or to other the like results. But on the morning after the
      Installation Banquet, she suffered him to wander to and fro among the
      eatables and drinkables, a perfectly free and unchecked man; so utterly to
      Mr Pinch&rsquo;s wonder and confusion, that like the wretched captive who
      recovered his liberty in his old age, he could make but little use of his
      enlargement, and fell into a strange kind of flutter for want of some kind
      hand to scrape his bread, and cut him off in the article of sugar with a
      lump, and pay him those other little attentions to which he was
      accustomed. There was something almost awful, too, about the
      self-possession of the new pupil; who &lsquo;troubled&rsquo; Mr Pecksniff for the
      loaf, and helped himself to a rasher of that gentleman&rsquo;s own particular
      and private bacon, with all the coolness in life. He even seemed to think
      that he was doing quite a regular thing, and to expect that Mr Pinch would
      follow his example, since he took occasion to observe of that young man
      &lsquo;that he didn&rsquo;t get on&rsquo;; a speech of so tremendous a character, that Tom
      cast down his eyes involuntarily, and felt as if he himself had committed
      some horrible deed and heinous breach of Mr Pecksniff&rsquo;s confidence.
      Indeed, the agony of having such an indiscreet remark addressed to him
      before the assembled family, was breakfast enough in itself, and would,
      without any other matter of reflection, have settled Mr Pinch&rsquo;s business
      and quenched his appetite, for one meal, though he had been never so
      hungry.
    </p>
    <p>
      The young ladies, however, and Mr Pecksniff likewise, remained in the very
      best of spirits in spite of these severe trials, though with something of
      a mysterious understanding among themselves. When the meal was nearly
      over, Mr Pecksniff smilingly explained the cause of their common
      satisfaction.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;It is not often,&rsquo; he said, &lsquo;Martin, that my daughters and I desert our
      quiet home to pursue the giddy round of pleasures that revolves abroad.
      But we think of doing so to-day.&rsquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Indeed, sir!&rsquo; cried the new pupil.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Yes,&rsquo; said Mr Pecksniff, tapping his left hand with a letter which he
      held in his right. &lsquo;I have a summons here to repair to London; on
      professional business, my dear Martin; strictly on professional business;
      and I promised my girls, long ago, that whenever that happened again, they
      should accompany me. We shall go forth to-night by the heavy coach&mdash;like
      the dove of old, my dear Martin&mdash;and it will be a week before we
      again deposit our olive-branches in the passage. When I say
      olive-branches,&rsquo; observed Mr Pecksniff, in explanation, &lsquo;I mean, our
      unpretending luggage.&rsquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;I hope the young ladies will enjoy their trip,&rsquo; said Martin.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Oh! that I&rsquo;m sure we shall!&rsquo; cried Mercy, clapping her hands. &lsquo;Good
      gracious, Cherry, my darling, the idea of London!&rsquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Ardent child!&rsquo; said Mr Pecksniff, gazing on her in a dreamy way. &lsquo;And yet
      there is a melancholy sweetness in these youthful hopes! It is pleasant to
      know that they never can be realised. I remember thinking once myself, in
      the days of my childhood, that pickled onions grew on trees, and that
      every elephant was born with an impregnable castle on his back. I have not
      found the fact to be so; far from it; and yet those visions have comforted
      me under circumstances of trial. Even when I have had the anguish of
      discovering that I have nourished in my breast on ostrich, and not a human
      pupil&mdash;even in that hour of agony, they have soothed me.&rsquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      At this dread allusion to John Westlock, Mr Pinch precipitately choked in
      his tea; for he had that very morning received a letter from him, as Mr
      Pecksniff very well knew.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;You will take care, my dear Martin,&rsquo; said Mr Pecksniff, resuming his
      former cheerfulness, &lsquo;that the house does not run away in our absence. We
      leave you in charge of everything. There is no mystery; all is free and
      open. Unlike the young man in the Eastern tale&mdash;who is described as a
      one-eyed almanac, if I am not mistaken, Mr Pinch?&mdash;&rsquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;A one-eyed calender, I think, sir,&rsquo; faltered Tom.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;They are pretty nearly the same thing, I believe,&rsquo; said Mr Pecksniff,
      smiling compassionately; &lsquo;or they used to be in my time. Unlike that young
      man, my dear Martin, you are forbidden to enter no corner of this house;
      but are requested to make yourself perfectly at home in every part of it.
      You will be jovial, my dear Martin, and will kill the fatted calf if you
      please!&rsquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      There was not the least objection, doubtless, to the young man&rsquo;s
      slaughtering and appropriating to his own use any calf, fat or lean, that
      he might happen to find upon the premises; but as no such animal chanced
      at that time to be grazing on Mr Pecksniff&rsquo;s estate, this request must be
      considered rather as a polite compliment that a substantial hospitality.
      It was the finishing ornament of the conversation; for when he had
      delivered it, Mr Pecksniff rose and led the way to that hotbed of
      architectural genius, the two-pair front.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Let me see,&rsquo; he said, searching among the papers, &lsquo;how you can best
      employ yourself, Martin, while I am absent. Suppose you were to give me
      your idea of a monument to a Lord Mayor of London; or a tomb for a
      sheriff; or your notion of a cow-house to be erected in a nobleman&rsquo;s park.
      Do you know, now,&rsquo; said Mr Pecksniff, folding his hands, and looking at
      his young relation with an air of pensive interest, &lsquo;that I should very
      much like to see your notion of a cow-house?&rsquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      But Martin by no means appeared to relish this suggestion.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;A pump,&rsquo; said Mr Pecksniff, &lsquo;is very chaste practice. I have found that a
      lamp post is calculated to refine the mind and give it a classical
      tendency. An ornamental turnpike has a remarkable effect upon the
      imagination. What do you say to beginning with an ornamental turnpike?&rsquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Whatever Mr Pecksniff pleased,&rsquo; said Martin, doubtfully.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Stay,&rsquo; said that gentleman. &lsquo;Come! as you&rsquo;re ambitious, and are a very
      neat draughtsman, you shall&mdash;ha ha!&mdash;you shall try your hand on
      these proposals for a grammar-school; regulating your plan, of course, by
      the printed particulars. Upon my word, now,&rsquo; said Mr Pecksniff, merrily,
      &lsquo;I shall be very curious to see what you make of the grammar-school. Who
      knows but a young man of your taste might hit upon something,
      impracticable and unlikely in itself, but which I could put into shape?
      For it really is, my dear Martin, it really is in the finishing touches
      alone, that great experience and long study in these matters tell. Ha, ha,
      ha! Now it really will be,&rsquo; continued Mr Pecksniff, clapping his young
      friend on the back in his droll humour, &lsquo;an amusement to me, to see what
      you make of the grammar-school.&rsquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      Martin readily undertook this task, and Mr Pecksniff forthwith proceeded
      to entrust him with the materials necessary for its execution; dwelling
      meanwhile on the magical effect of a few finishing touches from the hand
      of a master; which, indeed, as some people said (and these were the old
      enemies again!) was unquestionably very surprising, and almost miraculous;
      as there were cases on record in which the masterly introduction of an
      additional back window, or a kitchen door, or half-a-dozen steps, or even
      a water spout, had made the design of a pupil Mr Pecksniff&rsquo;s own work, and
      had brought substantial rewards into that gentleman&rsquo;s pocket. But such is
      the magic of genius, which changes all it handles into gold!
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;When your mind requires to be refreshed by change of occupation,&rsquo; said Mr
      Pecksniff, &lsquo;Thomas Pinch will instruct you in the art of surveying the
      back garden, or in ascertaining the dead level of the road between this
      house and the finger-post, or in any other practical and pleasing pursuit.
      There are a cart-load of loose bricks, and a score or two of old
      flower-pots, in the back yard. If you could pile them up my dear Martin,
      into any form which would remind me on my return say of St. Peter&rsquo;s at
      Rome, or the Mosque of St. Sophia at Constantinople, it would be at once
      improving to you and agreeable to my feelings. And now,&rsquo; said Mr
      Pecksniff, in conclusion, &lsquo;to drop, for the present, our professional
      relations and advert to private matters, I shall be glad to talk with you
      in my own room, while I pack up my portmanteau.&rsquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      Martin attended him; and they remained in secret conference together for
      an hour or more; leaving Tom Pinch alone. When the young man returned, he
      was very taciturn and dull, in which state he remained all day; so that
      Tom, after trying him once or twice with indifferent conversation, felt a
      delicacy in obtruding himself upon his thoughts, and said no more.
    </p>
    <p>
      He would not have had leisure to say much, had his new friend been ever so
      loquacious; for first of all Mr Pecksniff called him down to stand upon
      the top of his portmanteau and represent ancient statues there, until such
      time as it would consent to be locked; and then Miss Charity called him to
      come and cord her trunk; and then Miss Mercy sent for him to come and mend
      her box; and then he wrote the fullest possible cards for all the luggage;
      and then he volunteered to carry it all downstairs; and after that to see
      it safely carried on a couple of barrows to the old finger-post at the end
      of the lane; and then to mind it till the coach came up. In short, his
      day&rsquo;s work would have been a pretty heavy one for a porter, but his
      thorough good-will made nothing of it; and as he sat upon the luggage at
      last, waiting for the Pecksniffs, escorted by the new pupil, to come down
      the lane, his heart was light with the hope of having pleased his
      benefactor.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;I was almost afraid,&rsquo; said Tom, taking a letter from his pocket and
      wiping his face, for he was hot with bustling about though it was a cold
      day, &lsquo;that I shouldn&rsquo;t have had time to write it, and that would have been
      a thousand pities; postage from such a distance being a serious
      consideration, when one&rsquo;s not rich. She will be glad to see my hand, poor
      girl, and to hear that Pecksniff is as kind as ever. I would have asked
      John Westlock to call and see her, and tell her all about me by word of
      mouth, but I was afraid he might speak against Pecksniff to her, and make
      her uneasy. Besides, they are particular people where she is, and it might
      have rendered her situation uncomfortable if she had had a visit from a
      young man like John. Poor Ruth!&rsquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      Tom Pinch seemed a little disposed to be melancholy for half a minute or
      so, but he found comfort very soon, and pursued his ruminations thus:
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;I&rsquo;m a nice man, I don&rsquo;t think, as John used to say (John was a kind,
      merry-hearted fellow; I wish he had liked Pecksniff better), to be feeling
      low, on account of the distance between us, when I ought to be thinking,
      instead, of my extraordinary good luck in having ever got here. I must
      have been born with a silver spoon in my mouth, I am sure, to have ever
      come across Pecksniff. And here have I fallen again into my usual good
      luck with the new pupil! Such an affable, generous, free fellow, as he is,
      I never saw. Why, we were companions directly! and he a relation of
      Pecksniff&rsquo;s too, and a clever, dashing youth who might cut his way through
      the world as if it were a cheese! Here he comes while the words are on my
      lips&rsquo; said Tom; &lsquo;walking down the lane as if the lane belonged to him.&rsquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      In truth, the new pupil, not at all disconcerted by the honour of having
      Miss Mercy Pecksniff on his arm, or by the affectionate adieux of that
      young lady, approached as Mr Pinch spoke, followed by Miss Charity and Mr
      Pecksniff. As the coach appeared at the same moment, Tom lost no time in
      entreating the gentleman last mentioned, to undertake the delivery of his
      letter.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Oh!&rsquo; said Mr Pecksniff, glancing at the superscription. &lsquo;For your sister,
      Thomas. Yes, oh yes, it shall be delivered, Mr Pinch. Make your mind easy
      upon that score. She shall certainly have it, Mr Pinch.&rsquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      He made the promise with so much condescension and patronage, that Tom
      felt he had asked a great deal (this had not occurred to his mind before),
      and thanked him earnestly. The Miss Pecksniffs, according to a custom they
      had, were amused beyond description at the mention of Mr Pinch&rsquo;s sister.
      Oh the fright! The bare idea of a Miss Pinch! Good heavens!
    </p>
    <p>
      Tom was greatly pleased to see them so merry, for he took it as a token of
      their favour, and good-humoured regard. Therefore he laughed too and
      rubbed his hands and wished them a pleasant journey and safe return, and
      was quite brisk. Even when the coach had rolled away with the
      olive-branches in the boot and the family of doves inside, he stood waving
      his hand and bowing; so much gratified by the unusually courteous
      demeanour of the young ladies, that he was quite regardless, for the
      moment, of Martin Chuzzlewit, who stood leaning thoughtfully against the
      finger-post, and who after disposing of his fair charge had hardly lifted
      his eyes from the ground.
    </p>
    <p>
      The perfect silence which ensued upon the bustle and departure of the
      coach, together with the sharp air of the wintry afternoon, roused them
      both at the same time. They turned, as by mutual consent, and moved off
      arm-in-arm.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;How melancholy you are!&rsquo; said Tom; &lsquo;what is the matter?&rsquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Nothing worth speaking of,&rsquo; said Martin. &lsquo;Very little more than was the
      matter yesterday, and much more, I hope, than will be the matter
      to-morrow. I&rsquo;m out of spirits, Pinch.&rsquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Well,&rsquo; cried Tom, &lsquo;now do you know I am in capital spirits today, and
      scarcely ever felt more disposed to be good company. It was a very kind
      thing in your predecessor, John, to write to me, was it not?&rsquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Why, yes,&rsquo; said Martin carelessly; &lsquo;I should have thought he would have
      had enough to do to enjoy himself, without thinking of you, Pinch.&rsquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Just what I felt to be so very likely,&rsquo; Tom rejoined; &lsquo;but no, he keeps
      his word, and says, &ldquo;My dear Pinch, I often think of you,&rdquo; and all sorts
      of kind and considerate things of that description.&rsquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;He must be a devilish good-natured fellow,&rsquo; said Martin, somewhat
      peevishly: &lsquo;because he can&rsquo;t mean that, you know.&rsquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;I don&rsquo;t suppose he can, eh?&rsquo; said Tom, looking wistfully in his
      companion&rsquo;s face. &lsquo;He says so to please me, you think?&rsquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Why, is it likely,&rsquo; rejoined Martin, with greater earnestness, &lsquo;that a
      young man newly escaped from this kennel of a place, and fresh to all the
      delights of being his own master in London, can have much leisure or
      inclination to think favourably of anything or anybody he has left behind
      him here? I put it to you, Pinch, is it natural?&rsquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      After a short reflection, Mr Pinch replied, in a more subdued tone, that
      to be sure it was unreasonable to expect any such thing, and that he had
      no doubt Martin knew best.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Of course I know best,&rsquo; Martin observed.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Yes, I feel that,&rsquo; said Mr Pinch mildly. &lsquo;I said so.&rsquo; And when he had
      made this rejoinder, they fell into a blank silence again, which lasted
      until they reached home; by which time it was dark.
    </p>
    <p>
      Now, Miss Charity Pecksniff, in consideration of the inconvenience of
      carrying them with her in the coach, and the impossibility of preserving
      them by artificial means until the family&rsquo;s return, had set forth, in a
      couple of plates, the fragments of yesterday&rsquo;s feast. In virtue of which
      liberal arrangement, they had the happiness to find awaiting them in the
      parlour two chaotic heaps of the remains of last night&rsquo;s pleasure,
      consisting of certain filmy bits of oranges, some mummied sandwiches,
      various disrupted masses of the geological cake, and several entire
      captain&rsquo;s biscuits. That choice liquor in which to steep these dainties
      might not be wanting, the remains of the two bottles of currant wine had
      been poured together and corked with a curl-paper; so that every material
      was at hand for making quite a heavy night of it.
    </p>
    <p>
      Martin Chuzzlewit beheld these roystering preparations with infinite
      contempt, and stirring the fire into a blaze (to the great destruction of
      Mr Pecksniff&rsquo;s coals), sat moodily down before it, in the most comfortable
      chair he could find. That he might the better squeeze himself into the
      small corner that was left for him, Mr Pinch took up his position on Miss
      Mercy Pecksniff&rsquo;s stool, and setting his glass down upon the hearthrug and
      putting his plate upon his knees, began to enjoy himself.

      If Diogenes coming to life again could have rolled himself, tub and all,
      into Mr Pecksniff&rsquo;s parlour and could have seen Tom Pinch as he sat on
      Mercy Pecksniff&rsquo;s stool with his plate and glass before him he could not
      have faced it out, though in his surliest mood, but must have smiled
      good-temperedly. The perfect and entire satisfaction of Tom; his
      surpassing appreciation of the husky sandwiches, which crumbled in his
      mouth like saw-dust; the unspeakable relish with which he swallowed the
      thin wine by drops, and smacked his lips, as though it were so rich and
      generous that to lose an atom of its fruity flavour were a sin; the look
      with which he paused sometimes, with his glass in his hand, proposing
      silent toasts to himself; and the anxious shade that came upon his
      contented face when, after wandering round the room, exulting in its
      uninvaded snugness, his glance encountered the dull brow of his companion;
      no cynic in the world, though in his hatred of its men a very griffin,
      could have withstood these things in Thomas Pinch.
    </p>
    <p>
      Some men would have slapped him on the back, and pledged him in a bumper
      of the currant wine, though it had been the sharpest vinegar&mdash;aye,
      and liked its flavour too; some would have seized him by his honest hand,
      and thanked him for the lesson that his simple nature taught them. Some
      would have laughed with, and others would have laughed at him; of which
      last class was Martin Chuzzlewit, who, unable to restrain himself, at last
      laughed loud and long.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;That&rsquo;s right,&rsquo; said Tom, nodding approvingly. &lsquo;Cheer up! That&rsquo;s capital!&rsquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      At which encouragement young Martin laughed again; and said, as soon as he
      had breath and gravity enough:
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;I never saw such a fellow as you are, Pinch.&rsquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Didn&rsquo;t you though?&rsquo; said Tom. &lsquo;Well, it&rsquo;s very likely you do find me
      strange, because I have hardly seen anything of the world, and you have
      seen a good deal I dare say?&rsquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Pretty well for my time of life,&rsquo; rejoined Martin, drawing his chair
      still nearer to the fire, and spreading his feet out on the fender. &lsquo;Deuce
      take it, I must talk openly to somebody. I&rsquo;ll talk openly to you, Pinch.&rsquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Do!&rsquo; said Tom. &lsquo;I shall take it as being very friendly of you,&rsquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;I&rsquo;m not in your way, am I?&rsquo; inquired Martin, glancing down at Mr Pinch,
      who was by this time looking at the fire over his leg.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Not at all!&rsquo; cried Tom.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;You must know then, to make short of a long story,&rsquo; said Martin,
      beginning with a kind of effort, as if the revelation were not agreeable
      to him; &lsquo;that I have been bred up from childhood with great expectations,
      and have always been taught to believe that I should be, one day, very
      rich. So I should have been, but for certain brief reasons which I am
      going to tell you, and which have led to my being disinherited.&rsquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;By your father?&rsquo; inquired Mr Pinch, with open eyes.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;By my grandfather. I have had no parents these many years. Scarcely
      within my remembrance.&rsquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Neither have I,&rsquo; said Tom, touching the young man&rsquo;s hand with his own and
      timidly withdrawing it again. &lsquo;Dear me!&rsquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Why, as to that, you know, Pinch,&rsquo; pursued the other, stirring the fire
      again, and speaking in his rapid, off-hand way; &lsquo;it&rsquo;s all very right and
      proper to be fond of parents when we have them, and to bear them in
      remembrance after they&rsquo;re dead, if you have ever known anything of them.
      But as I never did know anything about mine personally, you know, why, I
      can&rsquo;t be expected to be very sentimental about &lsquo;em. And I am not; that&rsquo;s
      the truth.&rsquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      Mr Pinch was just then looking thoughtfully at the bars. But on his
      companion pausing in this place, he started, and said &lsquo;Oh! of course&rsquo;&mdash;and
      composed himself to listen again.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;In a word,&rsquo; said Martin, &lsquo;I have been bred and reared all my life by this
      grandfather of whom I have just spoken. Now, he has a great many good
      points&mdash;there is no doubt about that; I&rsquo;ll not disguise the fact from
      you&mdash;but he has two very great faults, which are the staple of his
      bad side. In the first place, he has the most confirmed obstinacy of
      character you ever met with in any human creature. In the second, he is
      most abominably selfish.&rsquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Is he indeed?&rsquo; cried Tom.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;In those two respects,&rsquo; returned the other, &lsquo;there never was such a man.
      I have often heard from those who know, that they have been, time out of
      mind, the failings of our family; and I believe there&rsquo;s some truth in it.
      But I can&rsquo;t say of my own knowledge. All I have to do, you know, is to be
      very thankful that they haven&rsquo;t descended to me, and, to be very careful
      that I don&rsquo;t contract &lsquo;em.&rsquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;To be sure,&rsquo; said Mr Pinch. &lsquo;Very proper.&rsquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Well, sir,&rsquo; resumed Martin, stirring the fire once more, and drawing his
      chair still closer to it, &lsquo;his selfishness makes him exacting, you see;
      and his obstinacy makes him resolute in his exactions. The consequence is
      that he has always exacted a great deal from me in the way of respect, and
      submission, and self-denial when his wishes were in question, and so
      forth. I have borne a great deal from him, because I have been under
      obligations to him (if one can ever be said to be under obligations to
      one&rsquo;s own grandfather), and because I have been really attached to him;
      but we have had a great many quarrels for all that, for I could not
      accommodate myself to his ways very often&mdash;not out of the least
      reference to myself, you understand, but because&mdash;&rsquo; he stammered
      here, and was rather at a loss.
    </p>
    <p>
      Mr Pinch being about the worst man in the world to help anybody out of a
      difficulty of this sort, said nothing.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Well! as you understand me,&rsquo; resumed Martin, quickly, &lsquo;I needn&rsquo;t hunt for
      the precise expression I want. Now I come to the cream of my story, and
      the occasion of my being here. I am in love, Pinch.&rsquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      Mr Pinch looked up into his face with increased interest.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;I say I am in love. I am in love with one of the most beautiful girls the
      sun ever shone upon. But she is wholly and entirely dependent upon the
      pleasure of my grandfather; and if he were to know that she favoured my
      passion, she would lose her home and everything she possesses in the
      world. There is nothing very selfish in <i>that </i>love, I think?&rsquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Selfish!&rsquo; cried Tom. &lsquo;You have acted nobly. To love her as I am sure you
      do, and yet in consideration for her state of dependence, not even to
      disclose&mdash;&rsquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;What are you talking about, Pinch?&rsquo; said Martin pettishly: &lsquo;don&rsquo;t make
      yourself ridiculous, my good fellow! What do you mean by not disclosing?&rsquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;I beg your pardon,&rsquo; answered Tom. &lsquo;I thought you meant that, or I
      wouldn&rsquo;t have said it.&rsquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;If I didn&rsquo;t tell her I loved her, where would be the use of my being in
      love?&rsquo; said Martin: &lsquo;unless to keep myself in a perpetual state of worry
      and vexation?&rsquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;That&rsquo;s true,&rsquo; Tom answered. &lsquo;Well! I can guess what <i>she </i>said when you
      told her,&rsquo; he added, glancing at Martin&rsquo;s handsome face.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Why, not exactly, Pinch,&rsquo; he rejoined, with a slight frown; &lsquo;because she
      has some girlish notions about duty and gratitude, and all the rest of it,
      which are rather hard to fathom; but in the main you are right. Her heart
      was mine, I found.&rsquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Just what I supposed,&rsquo; said Tom. &lsquo;Quite natural!&rsquo; and, in his great
      satisfaction, he took a long sip out of his wine-glass.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Although I had conducted myself from the first with the utmost
      circumspection,&rsquo; pursued Martin, &lsquo;I had not managed matters so well but
      that my grandfather, who is full of jealousy and distrust, suspected me of
      loving her. He said nothing to her, but straightway attacked me in
      private, and charged me with designing to corrupt the fidelity to himself
      (there you observe his selfishness), of a young creature whom he had
      trained and educated to be his only disinterested and faithful companion,
      when he should have disposed of me in marriage to his heart&rsquo;s content.
      Upon that, I took fire immediately, and told him that with his good leave
      I would dispose of myself in marriage, and would rather not be knocked
      down by him or any other auctioneer to any bidder whomsoever.&rsquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      Mr Pinch opened his eyes wider, and looked at the fire harder than he had
      done yet.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;You may be sure,&rsquo; said Martin, &lsquo;that this nettled him, and that he began
      to be the very reverse of complimentary to myself. Interview succeeded
      interview; words engendered words, as they always do; and the upshot of it
      was, that I was to renounce her, or be renounced by him. Now you must bear
      in mind, Pinch, that I am not only desperately fond of her (for though she
      is poor, her beauty and intellect would reflect great credit on anybody, I
      don&rsquo;t care of what pretensions who might become her husband), but that a
      chief ingredient in my composition is a most determined&mdash;&rsquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Obstinacy,&rsquo; suggested Tom in perfect good faith. But the suggestion was
      not so well received as he had expected; for the young man immediately
      rejoined, with some irritation,
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;What a fellow you are, Pinch!&rsquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;I beg your pardon,&rsquo; said Tom, &lsquo;I thought you wanted a word.&rsquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;I didn&rsquo;t want that word,&rsquo; he rejoined. &lsquo;I told you obstinacy was no part
      of my character, did I not? I was going to say, if you had given me leave,
      that a chief ingredient in my composition is a most determined firmness.&rsquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Oh!&rsquo; cried Tom, screwing up his mouth, and nodding. &lsquo;Yes, yes; I see!&rsquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;And being firm,&rsquo; pursued Martin, &lsquo;of course I was not going to yield to
      him, or give way by so much as the thousandth part of an inch.&rsquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;No, no,&rsquo; said Tom.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;On the contrary, the more he urged, the more I was determined to oppose
      him.&rsquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;To be sure!&rsquo; said Tom.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Very well,&rsquo; rejoined Martin, throwing himself back in his chair, with a
      careless wave of both hands, as if the subject were quite settled, and
      nothing more could be said about it&mdash;&lsquo;There is an end of the matter,
      and here am I!&rsquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      Mr Pinch sat staring at the fire for some minutes with a puzzled look,
      such as he might have assumed if some uncommonly difficult conundrum had
      been proposed, which he found it impossible to guess. At length he said:
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Pecksniff, of course, you had known before?&rsquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Only by name. No, I had never seen him, for my grandfather kept not only
      himself but me, aloof from all his relations. But our separation took
      place in a town in the adjoining country. From that place I came to
      Salisbury, and there I saw Pecksniff&rsquo;s advertisement, which I answered,
      having always had some natural taste, I believe, in the matters to which
      it referred, and thinking it might suit me. As soon as I found it to be
      his, I was doubly bent on coming to him if possible, on account of his
      being&mdash;&rsquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Such an excellent man,&rsquo; interposed Tom, rubbing his hands: &lsquo;so he is. You
      were quite right.&rsquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Why, not so much on that account, if the truth must be spoken,&rsquo; returned
      Martin, &lsquo;as because my grandfather has an inveterate dislike to him, and
      after the old man&rsquo;s arbitrary treatment of me, I had a natural desire to
      run as directly counter to all his opinions as I could. Well! As I said
      before, here I am. My engagement with the young lady I have been telling
      you about is likely to be a tolerably long one; for neither her prospects
      nor mine are very bright; and of course I shall not think of marrying
      until I am well able to do so. It would never do, you know, for me to be
      plunging myself into poverty and shabbiness and love in one room up three
      pair of stairs, and all that sort of thing.&rsquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;To say nothing of her,&rsquo; remarked Tom Pinch, in a low voice.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Exactly so,&rsquo; rejoined Martin, rising to warm his back, and leaning
      against the chimney-piece. &lsquo;To say nothing of her. At the same time, of
      course it&rsquo;s not very hard upon her to be obliged to yield to the necessity
      of the case; first, because she loves me very much; and secondly, because
      I have sacrificed a great deal on her account, and might have done much
      better, you know.&rsquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      It was a very long time before Tom said &lsquo;Certainly;&rsquo; so long, that he
      might have taken a nap in the interval, but he did say it at last.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Now, there is one odd coincidence connected with this love-story,&rsquo; said
      Martin, &lsquo;which brings it to an end. You remember what you told me last
      night as we were coming here, about your pretty visitor in the church?&rsquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Surely I do,&rsquo; said Tom, rising from his stool, and seating himself in the
      chair from which the other had lately risen, that he might see his face.
      &lsquo;Undoubtedly.&rsquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;That was she.&rsquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;I knew what you were going to say,&rsquo; cried Tom, looking fixedly at him,
      and speaking very softly. &lsquo;You don&rsquo;t tell me so?&rsquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;That was she,&rsquo; repeated the young man. &lsquo;After what I have heard from
      Pecksniff, I have no doubt that she came and went with my grandfather.&mdash;Don&rsquo;t
      you drink too much of that sour wine, or you&rsquo;ll have a fit of some sort,
      Pinch, I see.&rsquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;It is not very wholesome, I am afraid,&rsquo; said Tom, setting down the empty
      glass he had for some time held. &lsquo;So that was she, was it?&rsquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      Martin nodded assent; and adding, with a restless impatience, that if he
      had been a few days earlier he would have seen her; and that now she might
      be, for anything he knew, hundreds of miles away; threw himself, after a
      few turns across the room, into a chair, and chafed like a spoilt child.
    </p>
    <p>
      Tom Pinch&rsquo;s heart was very tender, and he could not bear to see the most
      indifferent person in distress; still less one who had awakened an
      interest in him, and who regarded him (either in fact, or as he supposed)
      with kindness, and in a spirit of lenient construction. Whatever his own
      thoughts had been a few moments before&mdash;and to judge from his face
      they must have been pretty serious&mdash;he dismissed them instantly, and
      gave his young friend the best counsel and comfort that occurred to him.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;All will be well in time,&rsquo; said Tom, &lsquo;I have no doubt; and some trial and
      adversity just now will only serve to make you more attached to each other
      in better days. I have always read that the truth is so, and I have a
      feeling within me, which tells me how natural and right it is that it
      should be. That never ran smooth yet,&rsquo; said Tom, with a smile which,
      despite the homeliness of his face, was pleasanter to see than many a
      proud beauty&rsquo;s brightest glance; &lsquo;what never ran smooth yet, can hardly be
      expected to change its character for us; so we must take it as we find it,
      and fashion it into the very best shape we can, by patience and
      good-humour. I have no power at all; I needn&rsquo;t tell you that; but I have
      an excellent will; and if I could ever be of use to you, in any way
      whatever, how very glad I should be!&rsquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Thank you,&rsquo; said Martin, shaking his hand. &lsquo;You&rsquo;re a good fellow, upon my
      word, and speak very kindly. Of course you know,&rsquo; he added, after a
      moment&rsquo;s pause, as he drew his chair towards the fire again, &lsquo;I should not
      hesitate to avail myself of your services if you could help me at all; but
      mercy on us!&rsquo;&mdash;Here he rumpled his hair impatiently with his hand,
      and looked at Tom as if he took it rather ill that he was not somebody
      else&mdash;&lsquo;you might as well be a toasting-fork or a frying-pan, Pinch,
      for any help you can render me.&rsquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Except in the inclination,&rsquo; said Tom, gently.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Oh! to be sure. I meant that, of course. If inclination went for
      anything, I shouldn&rsquo;t want help. I tell you what you may do, though, if
      you will, and at the present moment too.&rsquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;What is that?&rsquo; demanded Tom.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Read to me.&rsquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;I shall be delighted,&rsquo; cried Tom, catching up the candle with enthusiasm.
      &lsquo;Excuse my leaving you in the dark a moment, and I&rsquo;ll fetch a book
      directly. What will you like? Shakespeare?&rsquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Aye!&rsquo; replied his friend, yawning and stretching himself. &lsquo;He&rsquo;ll do. I am
      tired with the bustle of to-day, and the novelty of everything about me;
      and in such a case, there&rsquo;s no greater luxury in the world, I think, than
      being read to sleep. You won&rsquo;t mind my going to sleep, if I can?&rsquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Not at all!&rsquo; cried Tom.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Then begin as soon as you like. You needn&rsquo;t leave off when you see me
      getting drowsy (unless you feel tired), for it&rsquo;s pleasant to wake
      gradually to the sounds again. Did you ever try that?&rsquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;No, I never tried that,&rsquo; said Tom
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Well! You can, you know, one of these days when we&rsquo;re both in the right
      humour. Don&rsquo;t mind leaving me in the dark. Look sharp!&rsquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      Mr Pinch lost no time in moving away; and in a minute or two returned with
      one of the precious volumes from the shelf beside his bed. Martin had in
      the meantime made himself as comfortable as circumstances would permit, by
      constructing before the fire a temporary sofa of three chairs with Mercy&rsquo;s
      stool for a pillow, and lying down at full-length upon it.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Don&rsquo;t be too loud, please,&rsquo; he said to Pinch.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;No, no,&rsquo; said Tom.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;You&rsquo;re sure you&rsquo;re not cold&rsquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Not at all!&rsquo; cried Tom.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;I am quite ready, then.&rsquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      Mr Pinch accordingly, after turning over the leaves of his book with as
      much care as if they were living and highly cherished creatures, made his
      own selection, and began to read. Before he had completed fifty lines his
      friend was snoring.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Poor fellow!&rsquo; said Tom, softly, as he stretched out his head to peep at
      him over the backs of the chairs. &lsquo;He is very young to have so much
      trouble. How trustful and generous in him to bestow all this confidence in
      me. And that was she, was it?&rsquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      But suddenly remembering their compact, he took up the poem at the place
      where he had left off, and went on reading; always forgetting to snuff the
      candle, until its wick looked like a mushroom. He gradually became so much
      interested, that he quite forgot to replenish the fire; and was only
      reminded of his neglect by Martin Chuzzlewit starting up after the lapse
      of an hour or so, and crying with a shiver.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Why, it&rsquo;s nearly out, I declare! No wonder I dreamed of being frozen. Do
      call for some coals. What a fellow you are, Pinch!&rsquo;

      CHAPTER SEVEN
    </h2>
    <p>
      IN WHICH MR CHEVY SLYME ASSERTS THE INDEPENDENCE OF HIS SPIRIT, AND THE
      BLUE DRAGON LOSES A LIMB
    </p>
    <p>
      Martin began to work at the grammar-school next morning, with so much
      vigour and expedition, that Mr Pinch had new reason to do homage to the
      natural endowments of that young gentleman, and to acknowledge his
      infinite superiority to himself. The new pupil received Tom&rsquo;s compliments
      very graciously; and having by this time conceived a real regard for him,
      in his own peculiar way, predicted that they would always be the very best
      of friends, and that neither of them, he was certain (but particularly
      Tom), would ever have reason to regret the day on which they became
      acquainted. Mr Pinch was delighted to hear him say this, and felt so much
      flattered by his kind assurances of friendship and protection, that he was
      at a loss how to express the pleasure they afforded him. And indeed it may
      be observed of this friendship, such as it was, that it had within it more
      likely materials of endurance than many a sworn brotherhood that has been
      rich in promise; for so long as the one party found a pleasure in
      patronizing, and the other in being patronised (which was in the very
      essence of their respective characters), it was of all possible events
      among the least probable, that the twin demons, Envy and Pride, would ever
      arise between them. So in very many cases of friendship, or what passes
      for it, the old axiom is reversed, and like clings to unlike more than to
      like.
    </p>
    <p>
      They were both very busy on the afternoon succeeding the family&rsquo;s
      departure&mdash;Martin with the grammar-school, and Tom in balancing
      certain receipts of rents, and deducting Mr Pecksniff&rsquo;s commission from
      the same; in which abstruse employment he was much distracted by a habit
      his new friend had of whistling aloud while he was drawing&mdash;when they
      were not a little startled by the unexpected obtrusion into that sanctuary
      of genius, of a human head which, although a shaggy and somewhat alarming
      head in appearance, smiled affably upon them from the doorway, in a manner
      that was at once waggish, conciliatory, and expressive of approbation.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;I am not industrious myself, gents both,&rsquo; said the head, &lsquo;but I know how
      to appreciate that quality in others. I wish I may turn grey and ugly, if
      it isn&rsquo;t in my opinion, next to genius, one of the very charmingest
      qualities of the human mind. Upon my soul, I am grateful to my friend
      Pecksniff for helping me to the contemplation of such a delicious picture
      as you present. You remind me of Whittington, afterwards thrice Lord Mayor
      of London. I give you my unsullied word of honour, that you very strongly
      remind me of that historical character. You are a pair of Whittingtons,
      gents, without the cat; which is a most agreeable and blessed exception to
      me, for I am not attached to the feline species. My name is Tigg; how do
      you do?&rsquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      Martin looked to Mr Pinch for an explanation; and Tom, who had never in
      his life set eyes on Mr Tigg before, looked to that gentleman himself.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Chevy Slyme?&rsquo; said Mr Tigg, interrogatively, and kissing his left hand in
      token of friendship. &lsquo;You will understand me when I say that I am the
      accredited agent of Chevy Slyme; that I am the ambassador from the court
      of Chiv? Ha ha!&rsquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Heyday!&rsquo; asked Martin, starting at the mention of a name he knew. &lsquo;Pray,
      what does he want with me?&rsquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;If your name is Pinch&rsquo;&mdash;Mr Tigg began.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;It is not&rsquo; said Martin, checking himself. &lsquo;That is Mr Pinch.&rsquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;If that is Mr Pinch,&rsquo; cried Tigg, kissing his hand again, and beginning
      to follow his head into the room, &lsquo;he will permit me to say that I greatly
      esteem and respect his character, which has been most highly commended to
      me by my friend Pecksniff; and that I deeply appreciate his talent for the
      organ, notwithstanding that I do not, if I may use the expression, grind
      myself. If that is Mr Pinch, I will venture to express a hope that I see
      him well, and that he is suffering no inconvenience from the easterly
      wind?&rsquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Thank you,&rsquo; said Tom. &lsquo;I am very well.&rsquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;That is a comfort,&rsquo; Mr Tigg rejoined. &lsquo;Then,&rsquo; he added, shielding his
      lips with the palm of his hand, and applying them close to Mr Pinch&rsquo;s ear,
      &lsquo;I have come for the letter.&rsquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;For the letter,&rsquo; said Tom, aloud. &lsquo;What letter?&rsquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;The letter,&rsquo; whispered Tigg in the same cautious manner as before, &lsquo;which
      my friend Pecksniff addressed to Chevy Slyme, Esquire, and left with you.&rsquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;He didn&rsquo;t leave any letter with me,&rsquo; said Tom.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Hush!&rsquo; cried the other. &lsquo;It&rsquo;s all the same thing, though not so
      delicately done by my friend Pecksniff as I could have wished. The money.&rsquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;The money!&rsquo; cried Tom quite scared.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Exactly so,&rsquo; said Mr Tigg. With which he rapped Tom twice or thrice upon
      the breast and nodded several times, as though he would say that he saw
      they understood each other; that it was unnecessary to mention the
      circumstance before a third person; and that he would take it as a
      particular favour if Tom would slip the amount into his hand, as quietly
      as possible.
    </p>
    <p>
      Mr Pinch, however, was so very much astounded by this (to him)
      inexplicable deportment, that he at once openly declared there must be
      some mistake, and that he had been entrusted with no commission whatever
      having any reference to Mr Tigg or to his friend, either. Mr Tigg received
      this declaration with a grave request that Mr Pinch would have the
      goodness to make it again; and on Tom&rsquo;s repeating it in a still more
      emphatic and unmistakable manner, checked it off, sentence for sentence,
      by nodding his head solemnly at the end of each. When it had come to a
      close for the second time, Mr Tigg sat himself down in a chair and
      addressed the young men as follows:
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Then I tell you what it is, gents both. There is at this present moment
      in this very place, a perfect constellation of talent and genius, who is
      involved, through what I cannot but designate as the culpable negligence
      of my friend Pecksniff, in a situation as tremendous, perhaps, as the
      social intercourse of the nineteenth century will readily admit of. There
      is actually at this instant, at the Blue Dragon in this village&mdash;an
      ale-house, observe; a common, paltry, low-minded, clodhopping,
      pipe-smoking ale-house&mdash;an individual, of whom it may be said, in the
      language of the Poet, that nobody but himself can in any way come up to
      him; who is detained there for his bill. Ha! ha! For his bill. I repeat it&mdash;for
      his bill. Now,&rsquo; said Mr Tigg, &lsquo;we have heard of Fox&rsquo;s Book of Martyrs, I
      believe, and we have heard of the Court of Requests, and the Star Chamber;
      but I fear the contradiction of no man alive or dead, when I assert that
      my friend Chevy Slyme being held in pawn for a bill, beats any amount of
      cockfighting with which I am acquainted.&rsquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      Martin and Mr Pinch looked, first at each other, and afterwards at Mr
      Tigg, who with his arms folded on his breast surveyed them, half in
      despondency and half in bitterness.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Don&rsquo;t mistake me, gents both,&rsquo; he said, stretching forth his right hand.
      &lsquo;If it had been for anything but a bill, I could have borne it, and could
      still have looked upon mankind with some feeling of respect; but when such
      a man as my friend Slyme is detained for a score&mdash;a thing in itself
      essentially mean; a low performance on a slate, or possibly chalked upon
      the back of a door&mdash;I do feel that there is a screw of such magnitude
      loose somewhere, that the whole framework of society is shaken, and the
      very first principles of things can no longer be trusted. In short, gents
      both,&rsquo; said Mr Tigg with a passionate flourish of his hands and head,
      &lsquo;when a man like Slyme is detained for such a thing as a bill, I reject
      the superstitions of ages, and believe nothing. I don&rsquo;t even believe that
      I <i>don&rsquo;t</i> believe, curse me if I do!&rsquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;I am very sorry, I am sure,&rsquo; said Tom after a pause, &lsquo;but Mr Pecksniff
      said nothing to me about it, and I couldn&rsquo;t act without his instructions.
      Wouldn&rsquo;t it be better, sir, if you were to go to&mdash;to wherever you
      came from&mdash;yourself, and remit the money to your friend?&rsquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;How can that be done, when I am detained also?&rsquo; said Mr Tigg; &lsquo;and when
      moreover, owing to the astounding, and I must add, guilty negligence of my
      friend Pecksniff, I have no money for coach-hire?&rsquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      Tom thought of reminding the gentleman (who, no doubt, in his agitation
      had forgotten it) that there was a post-office in the land; and that
      possibly if he wrote to some friend or agent for a remittance it might not
      be lost upon the road; or at all events that the chance, however
      desperate, was worth trusting to. But, as his good-nature presently
      suggested to him certain reasons for abstaining from this hint, he paused
      again, and then asked:
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Did you say, sir, that you were detained also?&rsquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Come here,&rsquo; said Mr Tigg, rising. &lsquo;You have no objection to my opening
      this window for a moment?&rsquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Certainly not,&rsquo; said Tom.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Very good,&rsquo; said Mr Tigg, lifting the sash. &lsquo;You see a fellow down there
      in a red neckcloth and no waistcoat?&rsquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Of course I do,&rsquo; cried Tom. &lsquo;That&rsquo;s Mark Tapley.&rsquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Mark Tapley is it?&rsquo; said the gentleman. &lsquo;Then Mark Tapley had not only
      the great politeness to follow me to this house, but is waiting now, to
      see me home again. And for that attention, sir,&rsquo; added Mr Tigg, stroking
      his moustache, &lsquo;I can tell you, that Mark Tapley had better in his infancy
      have been fed to suffocation by Mrs Tapley, than preserved to this time.&rsquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      Mr Pinch was not so dismayed by this terrible threat, but that he had
      voice enough to call to Mark to come in, and upstairs; a summons which he
      so speedily obeyed, that almost as soon as Tom and Mr Tigg had drawn in
      their heads and closed the window again, he, the denounced, appeared
      before them.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Come here, Mark!&rsquo; said Mr Pinch. &lsquo;Good gracious me! what&rsquo;s the matter
      between Mrs Lupin and this gentleman?&rsquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;What gentleman, sir?&rsquo; said Mark. &lsquo;I don&rsquo;t see no gentleman here sir,
      excepting you and the new gentleman,&rsquo; to whom he made a rough kind of bow&mdash;&lsquo;and
      there&rsquo;s nothing wrong between Mrs Lupin and either of you, Mr Pinch, I am
      sure.&rsquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Nonsense, Mark!&rsquo; cried Tom. &lsquo;You see Mr&mdash;&rsquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Tigg,&rsquo; interposed that gentleman. &lsquo;Wait a bit. I shall crush him soon.
      All in good time!&rsquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Oh <i>him</i>!&rsquo; rejoined Mark, with an air of careless defiance. &lsquo;Yes, I see
      <i>him</i>. I could see him a little better, if he&rsquo;d shave himself, and get his
      hair cut.&rsquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      Mr Tigg shook his head with a ferocious look, and smote himself once upon
      the breast.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;It&rsquo;s no use,&rsquo; said Mark. &lsquo;If you knock ever so much in that quarter,
      you&rsquo;ll get no answer. I know better. There&rsquo;s nothing there but padding;
      and a greasy sort it is.&rsquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Nay, Mark,&rsquo; urged Mr Pinch, interposing to prevent hostilities, &lsquo;tell me
      what I ask you. You&rsquo;re not out of temper, I hope?&rsquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Out of temper, sir!&rsquo; cried Mark, with a grin; &lsquo;why no, sir. There&rsquo;s a
      little credit&mdash;not much&mdash;in being jolly, when such fellows as
      him is a-going about like roaring lions; if there is any breed of lions,
      at least, as is all roar and mane. What is there between him and Mrs
      Lupin, sir? Why, there&rsquo;s a score between him and Mrs Lupin. And I think
      Mrs Lupin lets him and his friend off very easy in not charging &lsquo;em double
      prices for being a disgrace to the Dragon. That&rsquo;s my opinion. I wouldn&rsquo;t
      have any such Peter the Wild Boy as him in my house, sir, not if I was
      paid race-week prices for it. He&rsquo;s enough to turn the very beer in the
      casks sour with his looks; he is! So he would, if it had judgment enough.&rsquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;You&rsquo;re not answering my question, you know, Mark,&rsquo; observed Mr Pinch.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Well, sir,&rsquo; said Mark, &lsquo;I don&rsquo;t know as there&rsquo;s much to answer further
      than that. Him and his friend goes and stops at the Moon and Stars till
      they&rsquo;ve run a bill there; and then comes and stops with us and does the
      same. The running of bills is common enough Mr Pinch; it an&rsquo;t that as we
      object to; it&rsquo;s the ways of this chap. Nothing&rsquo;s good enough for him; all
      the women is dying for him he thinks, and is overpaid if he winks at &lsquo;em;
      and all the men was made to be ordered about by him. This not being
      aggravation enough, he says this morning to me, in his usual captivating
      way, &ldquo;We&rsquo;re going to-night, my man.&rdquo; &ldquo;Are you, sir?&rdquo; says I. &ldquo;Perhaps
      you&rsquo;d like the bill got ready, sir?&rdquo; &ldquo;Oh no, my man,&rdquo; he says; &ldquo;you
      needn&rsquo;t mind that. I&rsquo;ll give Pecksniff orders to see to that.&rdquo; In reply to
      which, the Dragon makes answer, &ldquo;Thankee, sir, you&rsquo;re very kind to honour
      us so far, but as we don&rsquo;t know any particular good of you, and you don&rsquo;t
      travel with luggage, and Mr Pecksniff an&rsquo;t at home (which perhaps you
      mayn&rsquo;t happen to be aware of, sir), we should prefer something more
      satisfactory;&rdquo; and that&rsquo;s where the matter stands. And I ask,&rsquo; said Mr
      Tapley, pointing, in conclusion, to Mr Tigg, with his hat, &lsquo;any lady or
      gentleman, possessing ordinary strength of mind, to say whether he&rsquo;s a
      disagreeable-looking chap or not!&rsquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Let me inquire,&rsquo; said Martin, interposing between this candid speech and
      the delivery of some blighting anathema by Mr Tigg, &lsquo;what the amount of
      this debt may be?&rsquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;In point of money, sir, very little,&rsquo; answered Mark. &lsquo;Only just turned of
      three pounds. But it an&rsquo;t that; it&rsquo;s the&mdash;&rsquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Yes, yes, you told us so before,&rsquo; said Martin. &lsquo;Pinch, a word with you.&rsquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;What is it?&rsquo; asked Tom, retiring with him to a corner of the room.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Why, simply&mdash;I am ashamed to say&mdash;that this Mr Slyme is a
      relation of mine, of whom I never heard anything pleasant; and that I
      don&rsquo;t want him here just now, and think he would be cheaply got rid of,
      perhaps, for three or four pounds. You haven&rsquo;t enough money to pay this
      bill, I suppose?&rsquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      Tom shook his head to an extent that left no doubt of his entire
      sincerity.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;That&rsquo;s unfortunate, for I am poor too; and in case you had had it, I&rsquo;d
      have borrowed it of you. But if we told this landlady we would see her
      paid, I suppose that would answer the same purpose?&rsquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Oh dear, yes!&rsquo; said Tom. &lsquo;She knows me, bless you!&rsquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Then let us go down at once and tell her so; for the sooner we are rid of
      their company the better. As you have conducted the conversation with this
      gentleman hitherto, perhaps you&rsquo;ll tell him what we purpose doing; will
      you?&rsquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      Mr Pinch, complying, at once imparted the intelligence to Mr Tigg, who
      shook him warmly by the hand in return, assuring him that his faith in
      anything and everything was again restored. It was not so much, he said,
      for the temporary relief of this assistance that he prized it, as for its
      vindication of the high principle that Nature&rsquo;s Nobs felt with Nature&rsquo;s
      Nobs, and that true greatness of soul sympathized with true greatness of
      soul, all the world over. It proved to him, he said, that like him they
      admired genius, even when it was coupled with the alloy occasionally
      visible in the metal of his friend Slyme; and on behalf of that friend, he
      thanked them; as warmly and heartily as if the cause were his own. Being
      cut short in these speeches by a general move towards the stairs, he took
      possession at the street door of the lapel of Mr Pinch&rsquo;s coat, as a
      security against further interruption; and entertained that gentleman with
      some highly improving discourse until they reached the Dragon, whither
      they were closely followed by Mark and the new pupil.
    </p>
    <p>
      The rosy hostess scarcely needed Mr Pinch&rsquo;s word as a preliminary to the
      release of her two visitors, of whom she was glad to be rid on any terms;
      indeed, their brief detention had originated mainly with Mr Tapley, who
      entertained a constitutional dislike to gentleman out-at-elbows who
      flourished on false pretences; and had conceived a particular aversion to
      Mr Tigg and his friend, as choice specimens of the species. The business
      in hand thus easily settled, Mr Pinch and Martin would have withdrawn
      immediately, but for the urgent entreaties of Mr Tigg that they would
      allow him the honour of presenting them to his friend Slyme, which were so
      very difficult of resistance that, yielding partly to these persuasions
      and partly to their own curiosity, they suffered themselves to be ushered
      into the presence of that distinguished gentleman.
    </p>
    <p>
      He was brooding over the remains of yesterday&rsquo;s decanter of brandy, and
      was engaged in the thoughtful occupation of making a chain of rings on the
      top of the table with the wet foot of his drinking-glass. Wretched and
      forlorn as he looked, Mr Slyme had once been in his way, the choicest of
      swaggerers; putting forth his pretensions boldly, as a man of infinite
      taste and most undoubted promise. The stock-in-trade requisite to set up
      an amateur in this department of business is very slight, and easily got
      together; a trick of the nose and a curl of the lip sufficient to compound
      a tolerable sneer, being ample provision for any exigency. But, in an evil
      hour, this off-shoot of the Chuzzlewit trunk, being lazy, and ill
      qualified for any regular pursuit and having dissipated such means as he
      ever possessed, had formally established himself as a professor of Taste
      for a livelihood; and finding, too late, that something more than his old
      amount of qualifications was necessary to sustain him in this calling, had
      quickly fallen to his present level, where he retained nothing of his old
      self but his boastfulness and his bile, and seemed to have no existence
      separate or apart from his friend Tigg. And now so abject and so pitiful
      was he&mdash;at once so maudlin, insolent, beggarly, and proud&mdash;that
      even his friend and parasite, standing erect beside him, swelled into a
      Man by contrast.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Chiv,&rsquo; said Mr Tigg, clapping him on the back, &lsquo;my friend Pecksniff not
      being at home, I have arranged our trifling piece of business with Mr
      Pinch and friend. Mr Pinch and friend, Mr Chevy Slyme! Chiv, Mr Pinch and
      friend!&rsquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;These are agreeable circumstances in which to be introduced to
      strangers,&rsquo; said Chevy Slyme, turning his bloodshot eyes towards Tom
      Pinch. &lsquo;I am the most miserable man in the world, I believe!&rsquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      Tom begged he wouldn&rsquo;t mention it; and finding him in this condition,
      retired, after an awkward pause, followed by Martin. But Mr Tigg so
      urgently conjured them, by coughs and signs, to remain in the shadow of
      the door, that they stopped there.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;I swear,&rsquo; cried Mr Slyme, giving the table an imbecile blow with his
      fist, and then feebly leaning his head upon his hand, while some drunken
      drops oozed from his eyes, &lsquo;that I am the wretchedest creature on record.
      Society is in a conspiracy against me. I&rsquo;m the most literary man alive.
      I&rsquo;m full of scholarship. I&rsquo;m full of genius; I&rsquo;m full of information; I&rsquo;m
      full of novel views on every subject; yet look at my condition! I&rsquo;m at
      this moment obliged to two strangers for a tavern bill!&rsquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      Mr Tigg replenished his friend&rsquo;s glass, pressed it into his hand, and
      nodded an intimation to the visitors that they would see him in a better
      aspect immediately.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Obliged to two strangers for a tavern bill, eh!&rsquo; repeated Mr Slyme, after
      a sulky application to his glass. &lsquo;Very pretty! And crowds of impostors,
      the while, becoming famous; men who are no more on a level with me than&mdash;Tigg,
      I take you to witness that I am the most persecuted hound on the face of
      the earth.&rsquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      With a whine, not unlike the cry of the animal he named, in its lowest
      state of humiliation, he raised his glass to his mouth again. He found
      some encouragement in it; for when he set it down he laughed scornfully.
      Upon that Mr Tigg gesticulated to the visitors once more, and with great
      expression, implying that now the time was come when they would see Chiv
      in his greatness.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Ha, ha, ha,&rsquo; laughed Mr Slyme. &lsquo;Obliged to two strangers for a tavern
      bill! Yet I think I&rsquo;ve a rich uncle, Tigg, who could buy up the uncles of
      fifty strangers! Have I, or have I not? I come of a good family, I
      believe! Do I, or do I not? I&rsquo;m not a man of common capacity or
      accomplishments, I think! Am I, or am I not?&rsquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;You are the American aloe of the human race, my dear Chiv,&rsquo; said Mr Tigg,
      &lsquo;which only blooms once in a hundred years!&rsquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Ha, ha, ha!&rsquo; laughed Mr Slyme again. &lsquo;Obliged to two strangers for a
      tavern bill! I obliged to two architect&rsquo;s apprentices. Fellows who measure
      earth with iron chains, and build houses like bricklayers. Give me the
      names of those two apprentices. How dare they oblige me!&rsquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      Mr Tigg was quite lost in admiration of this noble trait in his friend&rsquo;s
      character; as he made known to Mr Pinch in a neat little ballet of action,
      spontaneously invented for the purpose.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;I&rsquo;ll let &lsquo;em know, and I&rsquo;ll let all men know,&rsquo; cried Chevy Slyme, &lsquo;that
      I&rsquo;m none of the mean, grovelling, tame characters they meet with commonly.
      I have an independent spirit. I have a heart that swells in my bosom. I
      have a soul that rises superior to base considerations.&rsquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Oh Chiv, Chiv,&rsquo; murmured Mr Tigg, &lsquo;you have a nobly independent nature,
      Chiv!&rsquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;You go and do your duty, sir,&rsquo; said Mr Slyme, angrily, &lsquo;and borrow money
      for travelling expenses; and whoever you borrow it of, let &lsquo;em know that I
      possess a haughty spirit, and a proud spirit, and have infernally
      finely-touched chords in my nature, which won&rsquo;t brook patronage. Do you
      hear? Tell &lsquo;em I hate &lsquo;em, and that that&rsquo;s the way I preserve my
      self-respect; and tell &lsquo;em that no man ever respected himself more than I
      do!&rsquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      He might have added that he hated two sorts of men; all those who did him
      favours, and all those who were better off than himself; as in either case
      their position was an insult to a man of his stupendous merits. But he did
      not; for with the apt closing words above recited, Mr Slyme; of too
      haughty a stomach to work, to beg, to borrow, or to steal; yet mean enough
      to be worked or borrowed, begged or stolen for, by any catspaw that would
      serve his turn; too insolent to lick the hand that fed him in his need,
      yet cur enough to bite and tear it in the dark; with these apt closing
      words Mr Slyme fell forward with his head upon the table, and so declined
      into a sodden sleep.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Was there ever,&rsquo; cried Mr Tigg, joining the young men at the door, and
      shutting it carefully behind him, &lsquo;such an independent spirit as is
      possessed by that extraordinary creature? Was there ever such a Roman as
      our friend Chiv? Was there ever a man of such a purely classical turn of
      thought, and of such a toga-like simplicity of nature? Was there ever a
      man with such a flow of eloquence? Might he not, gents both, I ask, have
      sat upon a tripod in the ancient times, and prophesied to a perfectly
      unlimited extent, if previously supplied with gin-and-water at the public
      cost?&rsquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      Mr Pinch was about to contest this latter position with his usual
      mildness, when, observing that his companion had already gone downstairs,
      he prepared to follow him.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;You are not going, Mr Pinch?&rsquo; said Tigg.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Thank you,&rsquo; answered Tom. &lsquo;Yes. Don&rsquo;t come down.&rsquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Do you know that I should like one little word in private with you Mr
      Pinch?&rsquo; said Tigg, following him. &lsquo;One minute of your company in the
      skittle-ground would very much relieve my mind. Might I beseech that
      favour?&rsquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Oh, certainly,&rsquo; replied Tom, &lsquo;if you really wish it.&rsquo; So he accompanied
      Mr Tigg to the retreat in question; on arriving at which place that
      gentleman took from his hat what seemed to be the fossil remains of an
      antediluvian pocket-handkerchief, and wiped his eyes therewith.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;You have not beheld me this day,&rsquo; said Mr Tigg, &lsquo;in a favourable light.&rsquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Don&rsquo;t mention that,&rsquo; said Tom, &lsquo;I beg.&rsquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;But you have <i>not</i>,&rsquo; cried Tigg. &lsquo;I must persist in that opinion. If you
      could have seen me, Mr Pinch, at the head of my regiment on the coast of
      Africa, charging in the form of a hollow square, with the women and
      children and the regimental plate-chest in the centre, you would not have
      known me for the same man. You would have respected me, sir.&rsquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      Tom had certain ideas of his own upon the subject of glory; and
      consequently he was not quite so much excited by this picture as Mr Tigg
      could have desired.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;But no matter!&rsquo; said that gentleman. &lsquo;The school-boy writing home to his
      parents and describing the milk-and-water, said &ldquo;This is indeed weakness.&rdquo;
       I repeat that assertion in reference to myself at the present moment; and
      I ask your pardon. Sir, you have seen my friend Slyme?&rsquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;No doubt,&rsquo; said Mr Pinch.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Sir, you have been impressed by my friend Slyme?&rsquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Not very pleasantly, I must say,&rsquo; answered Tom, after a little
      hesitation.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;I am grieved but not surprised,&rsquo; cried Mr Tigg, detaining him with both
      hands, &lsquo;to hear that you have come to that conclusion; for it is my own.
      But, Mr Pinch, though I am a rough and thoughtless man, I can honour Mind.
      I honour Mind in following my friend. To you of all men, Mr Pinch, I have
      a right to make appeal on Mind&rsquo;s behalf, when it has not the art to push
      its fortune in the world. And so, sir&mdash;not for myself, who have no
      claim upon you, but for my crushed, my sensitive and independent friend,
      who has&mdash;I ask the loan of three half-crowns. I ask you for the loan
      of three half-crowns, distinctly, and without a blush. I ask it, almost as
      a right. And when I add that they will be returned by post, this week, I
      feel that you will blame me for that sordid stipulation.&rsquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      Mr Pinch took from his pocket an old-fashioned red-leather purse with a
      steel clasp, which had probably once belonged to his deceased grandmother.
      It held one half-sovereign and no more. All Tom&rsquo;s worldly wealth until
      next quarter-day.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Stay!&rsquo; cried Mr Tigg, who had watched this proceeding keenly. &lsquo;I was just
      about to say, that for the convenience of posting you had better make it
      gold. Thank you. A general direction, I suppose, to Mr Pinch at Mr
      Pecksniff&rsquo;s&mdash;will that find you?&rsquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;That&rsquo;ll find me,&rsquo; said Tom. &lsquo;You had better put Esquire to Mr Pecksniff&rsquo;s
      name, if you please. Direct to me, you know, at Seth Pecksniff&rsquo;s,
      Esquire.&rsquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;At Seth Pecksniff&rsquo;s, Esquire,&rsquo; repeated Mr Tigg, taking an exact note of
      it with a stump of pencil. &lsquo;We said this week, I believe?&rsquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Yes; or Monday will do,&rsquo; observed Tom.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;No, no, I beg your pardon. Monday will <i>not </i>do,&rsquo; said Mr Tigg. &lsquo;If we
      stipulated for this week, Saturday is the latest day. Did we stipulate for
      this week?&rsquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Since you are so particular about it,&rsquo; said Tom, &lsquo;I think we did.&rsquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      Mr Tigg added this condition to his memorandum; read the entry over to
      himself with a severe frown; and that the transaction might be the more
      correct and business-like, appended his initials to the whole. That done,
      he assured Mr Pinch that everything was now perfectly regular; and, after
      squeezing his hand with great fervour, departed.
    </p>
    <p>
      Tom entertained enough suspicion that Martin might possibly turn this
      interview into a jest, to render him desirous to avoid the company of that
      young gentleman for the present. With this view he took a few turns up and
      down the skittle-ground, and did not re-enter the house until Mr Tigg and
      his friend had quitted it, and the new pupil and Mark were watching their
      departure from one of the windows.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;I was just a-saying, sir, that if one could live by it,&rsquo; observed Mark,
      pointing after their late guests, &lsquo;that would be the sort of service for
      me. Waiting on such individuals as them would be better than
      grave-digging, sir.&rsquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;And staying here would be better than either, Mark,&rsquo; replied Tom. &lsquo;So
      take my advice, and continue to swim easily in smooth water.&rsquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;It&rsquo;s too late to take it now, sir,&rsquo; said Mark. &lsquo;I have broke it to her,
      sir. I am off to-morrow morning.&rsquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Off!&rsquo; cried Mr Pinch, &lsquo;where to?&rsquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;I shall go up to London, sir.&rsquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;What to be?&rsquo; asked Mr Pinch.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Well! I don&rsquo;t know yet, sir. Nothing turned up that day I opened my mind
      to you, as was at all likely to suit me. All them trades I thought of was
      a deal too jolly; there was no credit at all to be got in any of &lsquo;em. I
      must look for a private service, I suppose, sir. I might be brought out
      strong, perhaps, in a serious family, Mr Pinch.&rsquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Perhaps you might come out rather too strong for a serious family&rsquo;s
      taste, Mark.&rsquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;That&rsquo;s possible, sir. If I could get into a wicked family, I might do
      myself justice; but the difficulty is to make sure of one&rsquo;s ground,
      because a young man can&rsquo;t very well advertise that he wants a place, and
      wages an&rsquo;t so much an object as a wicked sitivation; can he, sir?&rsquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Why, no,&rsquo; said Mr Pinch, &lsquo;I don&rsquo;t think he can.&rsquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;An envious family,&rsquo; pursued Mark, with a thoughtful face; &lsquo;or a
      quarrelsome family, or a malicious family, or even a good out-and-out mean
      family, would open a field of action as I might do something in. The man
      as would have suited me of all other men was that old gentleman as was
      took ill here, for he really was a trying customer. Howsever, I must wait
      and see what turns up, sir; and hope for the worst.&rsquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;You are determined to go then?&rsquo; said Mr Pinch.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;My box is gone already, sir, by the waggon, and I&rsquo;m going to walk on
      to-morrow morning, and get a lift by the day coach when it overtakes me.
      So I wish you good-bye, Mr Pinch&mdash;and you too, sir&mdash;and all good
      luck and happiness!&rsquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      They both returned his greeting laughingly, and walked home arm-in-arm. Mr
      Pinch imparting to his new friend, as they went, such further particulars
      of Mark Tapley&rsquo;s whimsical restlessness as the reader is already
      acquainted with.
    </p>
    <p>
      In the meantime Mark, having a shrewd notion that his mistress was in very
      low spirits, and that he could not exactly answer for the consequences of
      any lengthened <i>tete-a-tete</i> in the bar, kept himself obstinately out of her
      way all the afternoon and evening. In this piece of generalship he was
      very much assisted by the great influx of company into the taproom; for
      the news of his intention having gone abroad, there was a perfect throng
      there all the evening, and much drinking of healths and clinking of mugs.
      At length the house was closed for the night; and there being now no help
      for it, Mark put the best face he could upon the matter, and walked
      doggedly to the bar-door.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;If I look at her,&rsquo; said Mark to himself, &lsquo;I&rsquo;m done. I feel that I&rsquo;m
      a-going fast.&rsquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;You have come at last,&rsquo; said Mrs Lupin.
    </p>
    <p>
      Aye, Mark said: There he was.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;And you are determined to leave us, Mark?&rsquo; cried Mrs Lupin.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Why, yes; I am,&rsquo; said Mark; keeping his eyes hard upon the floor.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;I thought,&rsquo; pursued the landlady, with a most engaging hesitation, &lsquo;that
      you had been&mdash;fond&mdash;of the Dragon?&rsquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;So I am,&rsquo; said Mark.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Then,&rsquo; pursued the hostess&mdash;and it really was not an unnatural
      inquiry&mdash;&lsquo;why do you desert it?&rsquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      But as he gave no manner of answer to this question; not even on its being
      repeated; Mrs Lupin put his money into his hand, and asked him&mdash;not
      unkindly, quite the contrary&mdash;what he would take?
    </p>
    <p>
      It is proverbial that there are certain things which flesh and blood
      cannot bear. Such a question as this, propounded in such a manner, at such
      a time, and by such a person, proved (at least, as far as, Mark&rsquo;s flesh
      and blood were concerned) to be one of them. He looked up in spite of
      himself directly; and having once looked up, there was no looking down
      again; for of all the tight, plump, buxom, bright-eyed, dimple-faced
      landladies that ever shone on earth, there stood before him then, bodily
      in that bar, the very pink and pineapple.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Why, I tell you what,&rsquo; said Mark, throwing off all his constraint in an
      instant and seizing the hostess round the waist&mdash;at which she was not
      at all alarmed, for she knew what a good young man he was&mdash;&lsquo;if I took
      what I liked most, I should take you. If I only thought what was best for
      me, I should take you. If I took what nineteen young fellows in twenty
      would be glad to take, and would take at any price, I should take you.
      Yes, I should,&rsquo; cried Mr Tapley, shaking his head expressively enough, and
      looking (in a momentary state of forgetfulness) rather hard at the
      hostess&rsquo;s ripe lips. &lsquo;And no man wouldn&rsquo;t wonder if I did!&rsquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      Mrs Lupin said he amazed her. She was astonished how he could say such
      things. She had never thought it of him.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Why, I never thought if of myself till now!&rsquo; said Mark, raising his
      eyebrows with a look of the merriest possible surprise. &lsquo;I always expected
      we should part, and never have no explanation; I meant to do it when I
      come in here just now; but there&rsquo;s something about you, as makes a man
      sensible. Then let us have a word or two together; letting it be
      understood beforehand,&rsquo; he added this in a grave tone, to prevent the
      possibility of any mistake, &lsquo;that I&rsquo;m not a-going to make no love, you
      know.&rsquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      There was for just one second a shade, though not by any means a dark one,
      on the landlady&rsquo;s open brow. But it passed off instantly, in a laugh that
      came from her very heart.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Oh, very good!&rsquo; she said; &lsquo;if there is to be no love-making, you had
      better take your arm away.&rsquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Lord, why should I!&rsquo; cried Mark. &lsquo;It&rsquo;s quite innocent.&rsquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Of course it&rsquo;s innocent,&rsquo; returned the hostess, &lsquo;or I shouldn&rsquo;t allow
      it.&rsquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Very well!&rsquo; said Mark. &lsquo;Then let it be.&rsquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      There was so much reason in this that the landlady laughed again, suffered
      it to remain, and bade him say what he had to say, and be quick about it.
      But he was an impudent fellow, she added.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Ha ha! I almost think I am!&rsquo; cried Mark, &lsquo;though I never thought so
      before. Why, I can say anything to-night!&rsquo;

      &lsquo;Say what you&rsquo;re going to say if you please, and be quick,&rsquo; returned the
      landlady, &lsquo;for I want to get to bed.&rsquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Why, then, my dear good soul,&rsquo; said Mark, &lsquo;and a kinder woman than you
      are never drawed breath&mdash;let me see the man as says she did!&mdash;what
      would be the likely consequence of us two being&mdash;&rsquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Oh nonsense!&rsquo; cried Mrs Lupin. &lsquo;Don&rsquo;t talk about that any more.&rsquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;No, no, but it an&rsquo;t nonsense,&rsquo; said Mark; &lsquo;and I wish you&rsquo;d attend. What
      would be the likely consequence of us two being married? If I can&rsquo;t be
      content and comfortable in this here lively Dragon now, is it to be looked
      for as I should be then? By no means. Very good. Then you, even with your
      good humour, would be always on the fret and worrit, always uncomfortable
      in your own mind, always a-thinking as you was getting too old for my
      taste, always a-picturing me to yourself as being chained up to the Dragon
      door, and wanting to break away. I don&rsquo;t know that it would be so,&rsquo; said
      Mark, &lsquo;but I don&rsquo;t know that it mightn&rsquo;t be. I am a roving sort of chap, I
      know. I&rsquo;m fond of change. I&rsquo;m always a-thinking that with my good health
      and spirits it would be more creditable in me to be jolly where there&rsquo;s
      things a-going on to make one dismal. It may be a mistake of mine you see,
      but nothing short of trying how it acts will set it right. Then an&rsquo;t it
      best that I should go; particular when your free way has helped me out to
      say all this, and we can part as good friends as we have ever been since
      first I entered this here noble Dragon, which,&rsquo; said Mr Tapley in
      conclusion, &lsquo;has my good word and my good wish to the day of my death!&rsquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      The hostess sat quite silent for a little time, but she very soon put both
      her hands in Mark&rsquo;s and shook them heartily.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;For you are a good man,&rsquo; she said; looking into his face with a smile,
      which was rather serious for her. &lsquo;And I do believe have been a better
      friend to me to-night than ever I have had in all my life.&rsquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Oh! as to that, you know,&rsquo; said Mark, &lsquo;that&rsquo;s nonsense. But love my heart
      alive!&rsquo; he added, looking at her in a sort of rapture, &lsquo;if you <i>are </i>that
      way disposed, what a lot of suitable husbands there is as you may drive
      distracted!&rsquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      She laughed again at this compliment; and, once more shaking him by both
      hands, and bidding him, if he should ever want a friend, to remember her,
      turned gayly from the little bar and up the Dragon staircase.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Humming a tune as she goes,&rsquo; said Mark, listening, &lsquo;in case I should
      think she&rsquo;s at all put out, and should be made down-hearted. Come, here&rsquo;s
      some credit in being jolly, at last!&rsquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      With that piece of comfort, very ruefully uttered, he went, in anything
      but a jolly manner, to bed.
    </p>
    <p>
      He rose early next morning, and was a-foot soon after sunrise. But it was
      of no use; the whole place was up to see Mark Tapley off; the boys, the
      dogs, the children, the old men, the busy people and the idlers; there
      they were, all calling out &lsquo;Good-b&rsquo;ye, Mark,&rsquo; after their own manner, and
      all sorry he was going. Somehow he had a kind of sense that his old
      mistress was peeping from her chamber-window, but he couldn&rsquo;t make up his
      mind to look back.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Good-b&rsquo;ye one, good-b&rsquo;ye all!&rsquo; cried Mark, waving his hat on the top of
      his walking-stick, as he strode at a quick pace up the little street.
      &lsquo;Hearty chaps them wheelwrights&mdash;hurrah! Here&rsquo;s the butcher&rsquo;s dog
      a-coming out of the garden&mdash;down, old fellow! And Mr Pinch a-going to
      his organ&mdash;good-b&rsquo;ye, sir! And the terrier-bitch from over the way&mdash;hie,
      then, lass! And children enough to hand down human natur to the latest
      posterity&mdash;good-b&rsquo;ye, boys and girls! There&rsquo;s some credit in it now.
      I&rsquo;m a-coming out strong at last. These are the circumstances that would
      try a ordinary mind; but I&rsquo;m uncommon jolly. Not quite as jolly as I could
      wish to be, but very near. Good-b&rsquo;ye! good-b&rsquo;ye!&rsquo;

    <h2>
      CHAPTER EIGHT
    </h2>
    <p>
      ACCOMPANIES MR PECKSNIFF AND HIS CHARMING DAUGHTERS TO THE CITY OF LONDON;
      AND RELATES WHAT FELL OUT UPON THEIR WAY THITHER
    </p>
    <p>
      When Mr Pecksniff and the two young ladies got into the heavy coach at the
      end of the lane, they found it empty, which was a great comfort;
      particularly as the outside was quite full and the passengers looked very
      frosty. For as Mr Pecksniff justly observed&mdash;when he and his
      daughters had burrowed their feet deep in the straw, wrapped themselves to
      the chin, and pulled up both windows&mdash;it is always satisfactory to
      feel, in keen weather, that many other people are not as warm as you are.
      And this, he said, was quite natural, and a very beautiful arrangement;
      not confined to coaches, but extending itself into many social
      ramifications. &lsquo;For&rsquo; (he observed), &lsquo;if every one were warm and well-fed,
      we should lose the satisfaction of admiring the fortitude with which
      certain conditions of men bear cold and hunger. And if we were no better
      off than anybody else, what would become of our sense of gratitude;
      which,&rsquo; said Mr Pecksniff with tears in his eyes, as he shook his fist at
      a beggar who wanted to get up behind, &lsquo;is one of the holiest feelings of
      our common nature.&rsquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      His children heard with becoming reverence these moral precepts from the
      lips of their father, and signified their acquiescence in the same, by
      smiles. That he might the better feed and cherish that sacred flame of
      gratitude in his breast, Mr Pecksniff remarked that he would trouble his
      eldest daughter, even in this early stage of their journey, for the
      brandy-bottle. And from the narrow neck of that stone vessel he imbibed a
      copious refreshment.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;What are we?&rsquo; said Mr Pecksniff, &lsquo;but coaches? Some of us are slow
      coaches&rsquo;&mdash;
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Goodness, Pa!&rsquo; cried Charity.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Some of us, I say,&rsquo; resumed her parent with increased emphasis, &lsquo;are slow
      coaches; some of us are fast coaches. Our passions are the horses; and
      rampant animals too&mdash;!&rsquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Really, Pa,&rsquo; cried both the daughters at once. &lsquo;How very unpleasant.&rsquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;And rampant animals too&rsquo; repeated Mr Pecksniff with so much
      determination, that he may be said to have exhibited, at the moment a sort
      of moral rampancy himself;&rsquo;&mdash;and Virtue is the drag. We start from
      The Mother&rsquo;s Arms, and we run to The Dust Shovel.&rsquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      When he had said this, Mr Pecksniff, being exhausted, took some further
      refreshment. When he had done that, he corked the bottle tight, with the
      air of a man who had effectually corked the subject also; and went to
      sleep for three stages.
    </p>
    <p>
      The tendency of mankind when it falls asleep in coaches, is to wake up
      cross; to find its legs in its way; and its corns an aggravation. Mr
      Pecksniff not being exempt from the common lot of humanity found himself,
      at the end of his nap, so decidedly the victim of these infirmities, that
      he had an irresistible inclination to visit them upon his daughters; which
      he had already begun to do in the shape of divers random kicks, and other
      unexpected motions of his shoes, when the coach stopped, and after a short
      delay the door was opened.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Now mind,&rsquo; said a thin sharp voice in the dark. &lsquo;I and my son go inside,
      because the roof is full, but you agree only to charge us outside prices.
      It&rsquo;s quite understood that we won&rsquo;t pay more. Is it?&rsquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;All right, sir,&rsquo; replied the guard.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Is there anybody inside now?&rsquo; inquired the voice.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Three passengers,&rsquo; returned the guard.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Then I ask the three passengers to witness this bargain, if they will be
      so good,&rsquo; said the voice. &lsquo;My boy, I think we may safely get in.&rsquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      In pursuance of which opinion, two people took their seats in the vehicle,
      which was solemnly licensed by Act of Parliament to carry any six persons
      who could be got in at the door.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;That was lucky!&rsquo; whispered the old man, when they moved on again. &lsquo;And a
      great stroke of policy in you to observe it. He, he, he! We couldn&rsquo;t have
      gone outside. I should have died of the rheumatism!&rsquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      Whether it occurred to the dutiful son that he had in some degree
      over-reached himself by contributing to the prolongation of his father&rsquo;s
      days; or whether the cold had effected his temper; is doubtful. But he
      gave his father such a nudge in reply, that that good old gentleman was
      taken with a cough which lasted for full five minutes without
      intermission, and goaded Mr Pecksniff to that pitch of irritation, that he
      said at last&mdash;and very suddenly:
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;There is no room! There is really no room in this coach for any gentleman
      with a cold in his head!&rsquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Mine,&rsquo; said the old man, after a moment&rsquo;s pause, &lsquo;is upon my chest,
      Pecksniff.&rsquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      The voice and manner, together, now that he spoke out; the composure of
      the speaker; the presence of his son; and his knowledge of Mr Pecksniff;
      afforded a clue to his identity which it was impossible to mistake.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Hem! I thought,&rsquo; said Mr Pecksniff, returning to his usual mildness,
      &lsquo;that I addressed a stranger. I find that I address a relative, Mr Anthony
      Chuzzlewit and his son Mr Jonas&mdash;for they, my dear children, are our
      travelling companions&mdash;will excuse me for an apparently harsh remark.
      It is not <i>my</i> desire to wound the feelings of any person with whom I am
      connected in family bonds. I may be a Hypocrite,&rsquo; said Mr Pecksniff,
      cuttingly; &lsquo;but I am not a Brute.&rsquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Pooh, pooh!&rsquo; said the old man. &lsquo;What signifies that word, Pecksniff?
      Hypocrite! why, we are all hypocrites. We were all hypocrites t&rsquo;other day.
      I am sure I felt that to be agreed upon among us, or I shouldn&rsquo;t have
      called you one. We should not have been there at all, if we had not been
      hypocrites. The only difference between you and the rest was&mdash;shall I
      tell you the difference between you and the rest now, Pecksniff?&rsquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;If you please, my good sir; if you please.&rsquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Why, the annoying quality in <i>you</i>, is,&rsquo; said the old man, &lsquo;that you never
      have a confederate or partner in <i>your </i>juggling; you would deceive
      everybody, even those who practise the same art; and have a way with you,
      as if you&mdash;he, he, he!&mdash;as if you really believed yourself. I&rsquo;d
      lay a handsome wager now,&rsquo; said the old man, &lsquo;if I laid wagers, which I
      don&rsquo;t and never did, that you keep up appearances by a tacit
      understanding, even before your own daughters here. Now I, when I have a
      business scheme in hand, tell Jonas what it is, and we discuss it openly.
      You&rsquo;re not offended, Pecksniff?&rsquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Offended, my good sir!&rsquo; cried that gentleman, as if he had received the
      highest compliments that language could convey.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Are you travelling to London, Mr Pecksniff?&rsquo; asked the son.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Yes, Mr Jonas, we are travelling to London. We shall have the pleasure of
      your company all the way, I trust?&rsquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Oh! ecod, you had better ask father that,&rsquo; said Jonas. &lsquo;I am not a-going
      to commit myself.&rsquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      Mr Pecksniff was, as a matter of course, greatly entertained by this
      retort. His mirth having subsided, Mr Jonas gave him to understand that
      himself and parent were in fact travelling to their home in the
      metropolis; and that, since the memorable day of the great family
      gathering, they had been tarrying in that part of the country, watching
      the sale of certain eligible investments, which they had had in their
      copartnership eye when they came down; for it was their custom, Mr Jonas
      said, whenever such a thing was practicable, to kill two birds with one
      stone, and never to throw away sprats, but as bait for whales. When he had
      communicated to Mr Pecksniff these pithy scraps of intelligence, he said,
      &lsquo;That if it was all the same to him, he would turn him over to father, and
      have a chat with the gals;&rsquo; and in furtherance of this polite scheme, he
      vacated his seat adjoining that gentleman, and established himself in the
      opposite corner, next to the fair Miss Mercy.
    </p>
    <p>
      The education of Mr Jonas had been conducted from his cradle on the
      strictest principles of the main chance. The very first word he learnt to
      spell was &lsquo;gain,&rsquo; and the second (when he got into two syllables),
      &lsquo;money.&rsquo; But for two results, which were not clearly foreseen perhaps by
      his watchful parent in the beginning, his training may be said to have
      been unexceptionable. One of these flaws was, that having been long taught
      by his father to over-reach everybody, he had imperceptibly acquired a
      love of over-reaching that venerable monitor himself. The other, that from
      his early habits of considering everything as a question of property, he
      had gradually come to look, with impatience, on his parent as a certain
      amount of personal estate, which had no right whatever to be going at
      large, but ought to be secured in that particular description of iron safe
      which is commonly called a coffin, and banked in the grave.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Well, cousin!&rsquo; said Mr Jonas&mdash;&lsquo;Because we <i>are </i>cousins, you know, a
      few times removed&mdash;so you&rsquo;re going to London?&rsquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      Miss Mercy replied in the affirmative, pinching her sister&rsquo;s arm at the
      same time, and giggling excessively.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Lots of beaux in London, cousin!&rsquo; said Mr Jonas, slightly advancing his
      elbow.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Indeed, sir!&rsquo; cried the young lady. &lsquo;They won&rsquo;t hurt us, sir, I dare
      say.&rsquo; And having given him this answer with great demureness she was so
      overcome by her own humour, that she was fain to stifle her merriment in
      her sister&rsquo;s shawl.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Merry,&rsquo; cried that more prudent damsel, &lsquo;really I am ashamed of you. How
      can you go on so? You wild thing!&rsquo; At which Miss Merry only laughed the
      more, of course.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;I saw a wildness in her eye, t&rsquo;other day,&rsquo; said Mr Jonas, addressing
      Charity. &lsquo;But you&rsquo;re the one to sit solemn! I say&mdash;You were regularly
      prim, cousin!&rsquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Oh! The old-fashioned fright!&rsquo; cried Merry, in a whisper. &lsquo;Cherry my
      dear, upon my word you must sit next him. I shall die outright if he talks
      to me any more; I shall, positively!&rsquo; To prevent which fatal consequence,
      the buoyant creature skipped out of her seat as she spoke, and squeezed
      her sister into the place from which she had risen.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Don&rsquo;t mind crowding me,&rsquo; cried Mr Jonas. &lsquo;I like to be crowded by gals.
      Come a little closer, cousin.&rsquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;No, thank you, sir,&rsquo; said Charity.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;There&rsquo;s that other one a-laughing again,&rsquo; said Mr Jonas; &lsquo;she&rsquo;s
      a-laughing at my father, I shouldn&rsquo;t wonder. If he puts on that old
      flannel nightcap of his, I don&rsquo;t know what she&rsquo;ll do! Is that my father
      a-snoring, Pecksniff?&rsquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Yes, Mr Jonas.&rsquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Tread upon his foot, will you be so good?&rsquo; said the young gentleman. &lsquo;The
      foot next you&rsquo;s the gouty one.&rsquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      Mr Pecksniff hesitating to perform this friendly office, Mr Jonas did it
      himself; at the same time crying:
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Come, wake up, father, or you&rsquo;ll be having the nightmare, and screeching
      out, I know.&mdash;Do you ever have the nightmare, cousin?&rsquo; he asked his
      neighbour, with characteristic gallantry, as he dropped his voice again.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Sometimes,&rsquo; answered Charity. &lsquo;Not often.&rsquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;The other one,&rsquo; said Mr Jonas, after a pause. &lsquo;Does <i>she </i>ever have the
      nightmare?&rsquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;I don&rsquo;t know,&rsquo; replied Charity. &lsquo;You had better ask her.&rsquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;She laughs so,&rsquo; said Jonas; &lsquo;there&rsquo;s no talking to her. Only hark how
      she&rsquo;s a-going on now! You&rsquo;re the sensible one, cousin!&rsquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Tut, tut!&rsquo; cried Charity.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Oh! But you are! You know you are!&rsquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Mercy is a little giddy,&rsquo; said Miss Charity. But she&rsquo;ll sober down in
      time.&rsquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;It&rsquo;ll be a very long time, then, if she does at all,&rsquo; rejoined her
      cousin. &lsquo;Take a little more room.&rsquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;I am afraid of crowding you,&rsquo; said Charity. But she took it
      notwithstanding; and after one or two remarks on the extreme heaviness of
      the coach, and the number of places it stopped at, they fell into a
      silence which remained unbroken by any member of the party until
      supper-time.
    </p>
    <p>
      Although Mr Jonas conducted Charity to the hotel and sat himself beside
      her at the board, it was pretty clear that he had an eye to &lsquo;the other
      one&rsquo; also, for he often glanced across at Mercy, and seemed to draw
      comparisons between the personal appearance of the two, which were not
      unfavourable to the superior plumpness of the younger sister. He allowed
      himself no great leisure for this kind of observation, however, being
      busily engaged with the supper, which, as he whispered in his fair
      companion&rsquo;s ear, was a contract business, and therefore the more she ate,
      the better the bargain was. His father and Mr Pecksniff, probably acting
      on the same wise principle, demolished everything that came within their
      reach, and by that means acquired a greasy expression of countenance,
      indicating contentment, if not repletion, which it was very pleasant to
      contemplate.
    </p>
    <p>
      When they could eat no more, Mr Pecksniff and Mr Jonas subscribed for two
      sixpenny-worths of hot brandy-and-water, which the latter gentleman
      considered a more politic order than one shillingsworth; there being a
      chance of their getting more spirit out of the innkeeper under this
      arrangement than if it were all in one glass. Having swallowed his share
      of the enlivening fluid, Mr Pecksniff, under pretence of going to see if
      the coach were ready, went secretly to the bar, and had his own little
      bottle filled, in order that he might refresh himself at leisure in the
      dark coach without being observed.
    </p>
    <p>
      These arrangements concluded, and the coach being ready, they got into
      their old places and jogged on again. But before he composed himself for a
      nap, Mr Pecksniff delivered a kind of grace after meat, in these words:
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;The process of digestion, as I have been informed by anatomical friends,
      is one of the most wonderful works of nature. I do not know how it may be
      with others, but it is a great satisfaction to me to know, when regaling
      on my humble fare, that I am putting in motion the most beautiful
      machinery with which we have any acquaintance. I really feel at such times
      as if I was doing a public service. When I have wound myself up, if I may
      employ such a term,&rsquo; said Mr Pecksniff with exquisite tenderness, &lsquo;and
      know that I am Going, I feel that in the lesson afforded by the works
      within me, I am a Benefactor to my Kind!&rsquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      As nothing could be added to this, nothing was said; and Mr Pecksniff,
      exulting, it may be presumed, in his moral utility, went to sleep again.
    </p>
    <p>
      The rest of the night wore away in the usual manner. Mr Pecksniff and Old
      Anthony kept tumbling against each other and waking up much terrified, or
      crushed their heads in opposite corners of the coach and strangely
      tattooed the surface of their faces&mdash;Heaven knows how&mdash;in their
      sleep. The coach stopped and went on, and went on and stopped, times out
      of number. Passengers got up and passengers got down, and fresh horses
      came and went and came again, with scarcely any interval between each team
      as it seemed to those who were dozing, and with a gap of a whole night
      between every one as it seemed to those who were broad awake. At length
      they began to jolt and rumble over horribly uneven stones, and Mr
      Pecksniff looking out of window said it was to-morrow morning, and they
      were there.
    </p>
    <p>
      Very soon afterwards the coach stopped at the office in the city; and the
      street in which it was situated was already in a bustle, that fully bore
      out Mr Pecksniff&rsquo;s words about its being morning, though for any signs of
      day yet appearing in the sky it might have been midnight. There was a
      dense fog too; as if it were a city in the clouds, which they had been
      travelling to all night up a magic beanstalk; and there was a thick crust
      upon the pavement like oilcake; which, one of the outsides (mad, no doubt)
      said to another (his keeper, of course), was Snow.
    </p>
    <p>
      Taking a confused leave of Anthony and his son, and leaving the luggage of
      himself and daughters at the office to be called for afterwards, Mr
      Pecksniff, with one of the young ladies under each arm, dived across the
      street, and then across other streets, and so up the queerest courts, and
      down the strangest alleys and under the blindest archways, in a kind of
      frenzy; now skipping over a kennel, now running for his life from a coach
      and horses; now thinking he had lost his way, now thinking he had found
      it; now in a state of the highest confidence, now despondent to the last
      degree, but always in a great perspiration and flurry; until at length
      they stopped in a kind of paved yard near the Monument. That is to say, Mr
      Pecksniff told them so; for as to anything they could see of the Monument,
      or anything else but the buildings close at hand, they might as well have
      been playing blindman&rsquo;s buff at Salisbury.
    </p>
    <p>
      Mr Pecksniff looked about him for a moment, and then knocked at the door
      of a very dingy edifice, even among the choice collection of dingy
      edifices at hand; on the front of which was a little oval board like a
      tea-tray, with this inscription&mdash;&lsquo;Commercial Boarding-House: M.
      Todgers.&rsquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      It seemed that M. Todgers was not up yet, for Mr Pecksniff knocked twice
      and rang thrice, without making any impression on anything but a dog over
      the way. At last a chain and some bolts were withdrawn with a rusty noise,
      as if the weather had made the very fastenings hoarse, and a small boy
      with a large red head, and no nose to speak of, and a very dirty
      Wellington boot on his left arm, appeared; who (being surprised) rubbed
      the nose just mentioned with the back of a shoe-brush, and said nothing.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Still a-bed my man?&rsquo; asked Mr Pecksniff.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Still a-bed!&rsquo; replied the boy. &lsquo;I wish they wos still a-bed. They&rsquo;re very
      noisy a-bed; all calling for their boots at once. I thought you was the
      Paper, and wondered why you didn&rsquo;t shove yourself through the grating as
      usual. What do you want?&rsquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      Considering his years, which were tender, the youth may be said to have
      preferred this question sternly, and in something of a defiant manner. But
      Mr Pecksniff, without taking umbrage at his bearing put a card in his
      hand, and bade him take that upstairs, and show them in the meanwhile into
      a room where there was a fire.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Or if there&rsquo;s one in the eating parlour,&rsquo; said Mr Pecksniff, &lsquo;I can find
      it myself.&rsquo; So he led his daughters, without waiting for any further
      introduction, into a room on the ground-floor, where a table-cloth (rather
      a tight and scanty fit in reference to the table it covered) was already
      spread for breakfast; displaying a mighty dish of pink boiled beef; an
      instance of that particular style of loaf which is known to housekeepers
      as a slack-baked, crummy quartern; a liberal provision of cups and
      saucers; and the usual appendages.
    </p>
    <p>
      Inside the fender were some half-dozen pairs of shoes and boots, of
      various sizes, just cleaned and turned with the soles upwards to dry; and
      a pair of short black gaiters, on one of which was chalked&mdash;in sport,
      it would appear, by some gentleman who had slipped down for the purpose,
      pending his toilet, and gone up again&mdash;&lsquo;Jinkins&rsquo;s Particular,&rsquo; while
      the other exhibited a sketch in profile, claiming to be the portrait of
      Jinkins himself.
    </p>
    <p>
      M. Todgers&rsquo;s Commercial Boarding-House was a house of that sort which is
      likely to be dark at any time; but that morning it was especially dark.
      There was an odd smell in the passage, as if the concentrated essence of
      all the dinners that had been cooked in the kitchen since the house was
      built, lingered at the top of the kitchen stairs to that hour, and like
      the Black Friar in Don Juan, &lsquo;wouldn&rsquo;t be driven away.&rsquo; In particular,
      there was a sensation of cabbage; as if all the greens that had ever been
      boiled there, were evergreens, and flourished in immortal strength. The
      parlour was wainscoted, and communicated to strangers a magnetic and
      instinctive consciousness of rats and mice. The staircase was very gloomy
      and very broad, with balustrades so thick and heavy that they would have
      served for a bridge. In a sombre corner on the first landing, stood a
      gruff old giant of a clock, with a preposterous coronet of three brass
      balls on his head; whom few had ever seen&mdash;none ever looked in the
      face&mdash;and who seemed to continue his heavy tick for no other reason
      than to warn heedless people from running into him accidentally. It had
      not been papered or painted, hadn&rsquo;t Todgers&rsquo;s, within the memory of man.
      It was very black, begrimed, and mouldy. And, at the top of the staircase,
      was an old, disjointed, rickety, ill-favoured skylight, patched and mended
      in all kinds of ways, which looked distrustfully down at everything that
      passed below, and covered Todgers&rsquo;s up as if it were a sort of human
      cucumber-frame, and only people of a peculiar growth were reared there.
    </p>
    <p>
      Mr Pecksniff and his fair daughters had not stood warming themselves at
      the fire ten minutes, when the sound of feet was heard upon the stairs,
      and the presiding deity of the establishment came hurrying in.
    </p>
    <p>
      M. Todgers was a lady, rather a bony and hard-featured lady, with a row of
      curls in front of her head, shaped like little barrels of beer; and on the
      top of it something made of net&mdash;you couldn&rsquo;t call it a cap exactly&mdash;which
      looked like a black cobweb. She had a little basket on her arm, and in it
      a bunch of keys that jingled as she came. In her other hand she bore a
      flaming tallow candle, which, after surveying Mr Pecksniff for one instant
      by its light, she put down upon the table, to the end that she might
      receive him with the greater cordiality.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Mr Pecksniff!&rsquo; cried Mrs Todgers. &lsquo;Welcome to London! Who would have
      thought of such a visit as this, after so&mdash;dear, dear!&mdash;so many
      years! How do you <i>do</i>, Mr Pecksniff?&rsquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;As well as ever; and as glad to see you, as ever;&rsquo; Mr Pecksniff made
      response. &lsquo;Why, you are younger than you used to be!&rsquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;<i>You </i>are, I am sure!&rsquo; said Mrs Todgers. &lsquo;You&rsquo;re not a bit changed.&rsquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;What do you say to this?&rsquo; cried Mr Pecksniff, stretching out his hand
      towards the young ladies. &lsquo;Does this make me no older?&rsquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Not your daughters!&rsquo; exclaimed the lady, raising her hands and clasping
      them. &lsquo;Oh, no, Mr Pecksniff! Your second, and her bridesmaid!&rsquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      Mr Pecksniff smiled complacently; shook his head; and said, &lsquo;My daughters,
      Mrs Todgers. Merely my daughters.&rsquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Ah!&rsquo; sighed the good lady, &lsquo;I must believe you, for now I look at &lsquo;em I
      think I should have known &lsquo;em anywhere. My dear Miss Pecksniffs, how happy
      your Pa has made me!&rsquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      She hugged them both; and being by this time overpowered by her feelings
      or the inclemency of the morning, jerked a little pocket handkerchief out
      of the little basket, and applied the same to her face.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Now, my good madam,&rsquo; said Mr Pecksniff, &lsquo;I know the rules of your
      establishment, and that you only receive gentlemen boarders. But it
      occurred to me, when I left home, that perhaps you would give my daughters
      house room, and make an exception in their favour.&rsquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Perhaps?&rsquo; cried Mrs Todgers ecstatically. &lsquo;Perhaps?&rsquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;I may say then, that I was sure you would,&rsquo; said Mr Pecksniff. &lsquo;I know
      that you have a little room of your own, and that they can be comfortable
      there, without appearing at the general table.&rsquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Dear girls!&rsquo; said Mrs Todgers. &lsquo;I must take that liberty once more.&rsquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      Mrs Todgers meant by this that she must embrace them once more, which she
      accordingly did with great ardour. But the truth was that the house being
      full with the exception of one bed, which would now be occupied by Mr
      Pecksniff, she wanted time for consideration; and so much time too (for it
      was a knotty point how to dispose of them), that even when this second
      embrace was over, she stood for some moments gazing at the sisters, with
      affection beaming in one eye, and calculation shining out of the other.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;I think I know how to arrange it,&rsquo; said Mrs Todgers, at length. &lsquo;A sofa
      bedstead in the little third room which opens from my own parlour.&mdash;Oh,
      you dear girls!&rsquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      Thereupon she embraced them once more, observing that she could not decide
      which was most like their poor mother (which was highly probable, seeing
      that she had never beheld that lady), but that she rather thought the
      youngest was; and then she said that as the gentlemen would be down
      directly, and the ladies were fatigued with travelling, would they step
      into her room at once?
    </p>
    <p>
      It was on the same floor; being, in fact, the back parlour; and had, as
      Mrs Todgers said, the great advantage (in London) of not being overlooked;
      as they would see when the fog cleared off. Nor was this a vainglorious
      boast, for it commanded at a perspective of two feet, a brown wall with a
      black cistern on the top. The sleeping apartment designed for the young
      ladies was approached from this chamber by a mightily convenient little
      door, which would only open when fallen against by a strong person. It
      commanded from a similar point of sight another angle of the wall, and
      another side of the cistern. &lsquo;Not the damp side,&rsquo; said Mrs Todgers. &lsquo;<i>That</i>
      is Mr Jinkins&rsquo;s.&rsquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      In the first of these sanctuaries a fire was speedily kindled by the
      youthful porter, who, whistling at his work in the absence of Mrs Todgers
      (not to mention his sketching figures on his corduroys with burnt
      firewood), and being afterwards taken by that lady in the fact, was
      dismissed with a box on his ears. Having prepared breakfast for the young
      ladies with her own hands, she withdrew to preside in the other room;
      where the joke at Mr Jinkins&rsquo;s expense seemed to be proceeding rather
      noisily.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;I won&rsquo;t ask you yet, my dears,&rsquo; said Mr Pecksniff, looking in at the
      door, &lsquo;how you like London. Shall I?&rsquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;We haven&rsquo;t seen much of it, Pa!&rsquo; cried Merry.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Nothing, I hope,&rsquo; said Cherry. (Both very miserably.)
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Indeed,&rsquo; said Mr Pecksniff, &lsquo;that&rsquo;s true. We have our pleasure, and our
      business too, before us. All in good time. All in good time!&rsquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      Whether Mr Pecksniff&rsquo;s business in London was as strictly professional as
      he had given his new pupil to understand, we shall see, to adopt that
      worthy man&rsquo;s phraseology, &lsquo;all in good time.&rsquo;

    <h2>
      CHAPTER NINE
    </h2>
    <h3>
      TOWN AND TODGER&rsquo;S
    </h3>
    <p>
      Surely there never was, in any other borough, city, or hamlet in the
      world, such a singular sort of a place as Todgers&rsquo;s. And surely London, to
      judge from that part of it which hemmed Todgers&rsquo;s round and hustled it,
      and crushed it, and stuck its brick-and-mortar elbows into it, and kept
      the air from it, and stood perpetually between it and the light, was
      worthy of Todgers&rsquo;s, and qualified to be on terms of close relationship
      and alliance with hundreds and thousands of the odd family to which
      Todgers&rsquo;s belonged.
    </p>
    <p>
      You couldn&rsquo;t walk about Todgers&rsquo;s neighbourhood, as you could in any other
      neighbourhood. You groped your way for an hour through lanes and byways,
      and court-yards, and passages; and you never once emerged upon anything
      that might be reasonably called a street. A kind of resigned distraction
      came over the stranger as he trod those devious mazes, and, giving himself
      up for lost, went in and out and round about and quietly turned back again
      when he came to a dead wall or was stopped by an iron railing, and felt
      that the means of escape might possibly present themselves in their own
      good time, but that to anticipate them was hopeless. Instances were known
      of people who, being asked to dine at Todgers&rsquo;s, had travelled round and
      round for a weary time, with its very chimney-pots in view; and finding
      it, at last, impossible of attainment, had gone home again with a gentle
      melancholy on their spirits, tranquil and uncomplaining. Nobody had ever
      found Todgers&rsquo;s on a verbal direction, though given within a few minutes&rsquo;
      walk of it. Cautious emigrants from Scotland or the North of England had
      been known to reach it safely, by impressing a charity-boy, town-bred, and
      bringing him along with them; or by clinging tenaciously to the postman;
      but these were rare exceptions, and only went to prove the rule that
      Todgers&rsquo;s was in a labyrinth, whereof the mystery was known but to a
      chosen few.
    </p>
    <p>
      Several fruit-brokers had their marts near Todgers&rsquo;s; and one of the first
      impressions wrought upon the stranger&rsquo;s senses was of oranges&mdash;of
      damaged oranges&mdash;with blue and green bruises on them, festering in
      boxes, or mouldering away in cellars. All day long, a stream of porters
      from the wharves beside the river, each bearing on his back a bursting
      chest of oranges, poured slowly through the narrow passages; while
      underneath the archway by the public-house, the knots of those who rested
      and regaled within, were piled from morning until night. Strange solitary
      pumps were found near Todgers&rsquo;s hiding themselves for the most part in
      blind alleys, and keeping company with fire-ladders. There were churches
      also by dozens, with many a ghostly little churchyard, all overgrown with
      such straggling vegetation as springs up spontaneously from damp, and
      graves, and rubbish. In some of these dingy resting-places which bore much
      the same analogy to green churchyards, as the pots of earth for mignonette
      and wall-flower in the windows overlooking them did to rustic gardens,
      there were trees; tall trees; still putting forth their leaves in each
      succeeding year, with such a languishing remembrance of their kind (so one
      might fancy, looking on their sickly boughs) as birds in cages have of
      theirs. Here, paralysed old watchmen guarded the bodies of the dead at
      night, year after year, until at last they joined that solemn brotherhood;
      and, saving that they slept below the ground a sounder sleep than even
      they had ever known above it, and were shut up in another kind of box,
      their condition can hardly be said to have undergone any material change
      when they, in turn, were watched themselves.
    </p>
    <p>
      Among the narrow thoroughfares at hand, there lingered, here and there, an
      ancient doorway of carved oak, from which, of old, the sounds of revelry
      and feasting often came; but now these mansions, only used for
      storehouses, were dark and dull, and, being filled with wool, and cotton,
      and the like&mdash;such heavy merchandise as stifles sound and stops the
      throat of echo&mdash;had an air of palpable deadness about them which,
      added to their silence and desertion, made them very grim. In like manner,
      there were gloomy courtyards in these parts, into which few but belated
      wayfarers ever strayed, and where vast bags and packs of goods, upward or
      downward bound, were for ever dangling between heaven and earth from lofty
      cranes There were more trucks near Todgers&rsquo;s than you would suppose whole
      city could ever need; not active trucks, but a vagabond race, for ever
      lounging in the narrow lanes before their masters&rsquo; doors and stopping up
      the pass; so that when a stray hackney-coach or lumbering waggon came that
      way, they were the cause of such an uproar as enlivened the whole
      neighbourhood, and made the bells in the next churchtower vibrate again.
      In the throats and maws of dark no-thoroughfares near Todgers&rsquo;s,
      individual wine-merchants and wholesale dealers in grocery-ware had
      perfect little towns of their own; and, deep among the foundations of
      these buildings, the ground was undermined and burrowed out into stables,
      where cart-horses, troubled by rats, might be heard on a quiet Sunday
      rattling their halters, as disturbed spirits in tales of haunted houses
      are said to clank their chains.
    </p>
    <p>
      To tell of half the queer old taverns that had a drowsy and secret
      existence near Todgers&rsquo;s, would fill a goodly book; while a second volume
      no less capacious might be devoted to an account of the quaint old guests
      who frequented their dimly lighted parlours. These were, in general,
      ancient inhabitants of that region; born, and bred there from boyhood, who
      had long since become wheezy and asthmatical, and short of breath, except
      in the article of story-telling; in which respect they were still
      marvellously long-winded. These gentry were much opposed to steam and all
      new-fangled ways, and held ballooning to be sinful, and deplored the
      degeneracy of the times; which that particular member of each little club
      who kept the keys of the nearest church, professionally, always attributed
      to the prevalence of dissent and irreligion; though the major part of the
      company inclined to the belief that virtue went out with hair-powder, and
      that Old England&rsquo;s greatness had decayed amain with barbers.
    </p>
    <p>
      As to Todgers&rsquo;s itself&mdash;speaking of it only as a house in that
      neighbourhood, and making no reference to its merits as a commercial
      boarding establishment&mdash;it was worthy to stand where it did. There
      was one staircase-window in it, at the side of the house, on the ground
      floor; which tradition said had not been opened for a hundred years at
      least, and which, abutting on an always dirty lane, was so begrimed and
      coated with a century&rsquo;s mud, that no one pane of glass could possibly fall
      out, though all were cracked and broken twenty times. But the grand
      mystery of Todgers&rsquo;s was the cellarage, approachable only by a little back
      door and a rusty grating; which cellarage within the memory of man had had
      no connection with the house, but had always been the freehold property of
      somebody else, and was reported to be full of wealth; though in what shape&mdash;whether
      in silver, brass, or gold, or butts of wine, or casks of gun-powder&mdash;was
      matter of profound uncertainty and supreme indifference to Todgers&rsquo;s and
      all its inmates.
    </p>
    <p>
      The top of the house was worthy of notice. There was a sort of terrace on
      the roof, with posts and fragments of rotten lines, once intended to dry
      clothes upon; and there were two or three tea-chests out there, full of
      earth, with forgotten plants in them, like old walking-sticks. Whoever
      climbed to this observatory, was stunned at first from having knocked his
      head against the little door in coming out; and after that, was for the
      moment choked from having looked perforce, straight down the kitchen
      chimney; but these two stages over, there were things to gaze at from the
      top of Todgers&rsquo;s, well worth your seeing too. For first and foremost, if
      the day were bright, you observed upon the house-tops, stretching far
      away, a long dark path; the shadow of the Monument; and turning round, the
      tall original was close beside you, with every hair erect upon his golden
      head, as if the doings of the city frightened him. Then there were
      steeples, towers, belfries, shining vanes, and masts of ships; a very
      forest. Gables, housetops, garret-windows, wilderness upon wilderness.
      Smoke and noise enough for all the world at once.
    </p>
    <p>
      After the first glance, there were slight features in the midst of this
      crowd of objects, which sprung out from the mass without any reason, as it
      were, and took hold of the attention whether the spectator would or no.
      Thus, the revolving chimney-pots on one great stack of buildings seemed to
      be turning gravely to each other every now and then, and whispering the
      result of their separate observation of what was going on below. Others,
      of a crook-backed shape, appeared to be maliciously holding themselves
      askew, that they might shut the prospect out and baffle Todgers&rsquo;s. The man
      who was mending a pen at an upper window over the way, became of paramount
      importance in the scene, and made a blank in it, ridiculously
      disproportionate in its extent, when he retired. The gambols of a piece of
      cloth upon the dyer&rsquo;s pole had far more interest for the moment than all
      the changing motion of the crowd. Yet even while the looker-on felt angry
      with himself for this, and wondered how it was, the tumult swelled into a
      roar; the hosts of objects seemed to thicken and expand a hundredfold, and
      after gazing round him, quite scared, he turned into Todgers&rsquo;s again, much
      more rapidly than he came out; and ten to one he told M. Todgers
      afterwards that if he hadn&rsquo;t done so, he would certainly have come into
      the street by the shortest cut; that is to say, head-foremost.
    </p>
    <p>
      So said the two Miss Pecksniffs, when they retired with Mrs Todgers from
      this place of espial, leaving the youthful porter to close the door and
      follow them downstairs; who, being of a playful temperament, and
      contemplating with a delight peculiar to his sex and time of life, any
      chance of dashing himself into small fragments, lingered behind to walk
      upon the parapet.
    </p>
    <p>
      It being the second day of their stay in London, the Miss Pecksniffs and
      Mrs Todgers were by this time highly confidential, insomuch that the
      last-named lady had already communicated the particulars of three early
      disappointments of a tender nature; and had furthermore possessed her
      young friends with a general summary of the life, conduct, and character
      of Mr Todgers. Who, it seemed, had cut his matrimonial career rather
      short, by unlawfully running away from his happiness, and establishing
      himself in foreign countries as a bachelor.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Your pa was once a little particular in his attentions, my dears,&rsquo; said
      Mrs Todgers, &lsquo;but to be your ma was too much happiness denied me. You&rsquo;d
      hardly know who this was done for, perhaps?&rsquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      She called their attention to an oval miniature, like a little blister,
      which was tacked up over the kettle-holder, and in which there was a
      dreamy shadowing forth of her own visage.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;It&rsquo;s a speaking likeness!&rsquo; cried the two Miss Pecksniffs.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;It was considered so once,&rsquo; said Mrs Todgers, warming herself in a
      gentlemanly manner at the fire; &lsquo;but I hardly thought you would have known
      it, my loves.&rsquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      They would have known it anywhere. If they could have met with it in the
      street, or seen it in a shop window, they would have cried &lsquo;Good gracious!
      Mrs Todgers!&rsquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Presiding over an establishment like this, makes sad havoc with the
      features, my dear Miss Pecksniffs,&rsquo; said Mrs Todgers. &lsquo;The gravy alone, is
      enough to add twenty years to one&rsquo;s age, I do assure you.&rsquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Lor&rsquo;!&rsquo; cried the two Miss Pecksniffs.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;The anxiety of that one item, my dears,&rsquo; said Mrs Todgers, &lsquo;keeps the
      mind continually upon the stretch. There is no such passion in human
      nature, as the passion for gravy among commercial gentlemen. It&rsquo;s nothing
      to say a joint won&rsquo;t yield&mdash;a whole animal wouldn&rsquo;t yield&mdash;the
      amount of gravy they expect each day at dinner. And what I have undergone
      in consequence,&rsquo; cried Mrs Todgers, raising her eyes and shaking her head,
      &lsquo;no one would believe!&rsquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Just like Mr Pinch, Merry!&rsquo; said Charity. &lsquo;We have always noticed it in
      him, you remember?&rsquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Yes, my dear,&rsquo; giggled Merry, &lsquo;but we have never given it him, you know.&rsquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;You, my dears, having to deal with your pa&rsquo;s pupils who can&rsquo;t help
      themselves, are able to take your own way,&rsquo; said Mrs Todgers; &lsquo;but in a
      commercial establishment, where any gentleman may say any Saturday
      evening, &ldquo;Mrs Todgers, this day week we part, in consequence of the
      cheese,&rdquo; it is not so easy to preserve a pleasant understanding. Your pa
      was kind enough,&rsquo; added the good lady, &lsquo;to invite me to take a ride with
      you to-day; and I think he mentioned that you were going to call upon Miss
      Pinch. Any relation to the gentleman you were speaking of just now, Miss
      Pecksniff?&rsquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;For goodness sake, Mrs Todgers,&rsquo; interposed the lively Merry, &lsquo;don&rsquo;t call
      him a gentleman. My dear Cherry, Pinch a gentleman! The idea!&rsquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;What a wicked girl you are!&rsquo; cried Mrs Todgers, embracing her with great
      affection. &lsquo;You are quite a quiz, I do declare! My dear Miss Pecksniff,
      what a happiness your sister&rsquo;s spirits must be to your pa and self!&rsquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;He&rsquo;s the most hideous, goggle-eyed creature, Mrs Todgers, in existence,&rsquo;
      resumed Merry: &lsquo;quite an ogre. The ugliest, awkwardest frightfullest
      being, you can imagine. This is his sister, so I leave you to suppose what
      <i>she </i>is. I shall be obliged to laugh outright, I know I shall!&rsquo; cried the
      charming girl, &lsquo;I never shall be able to keep my countenance. The notion
      of a Miss Pinch presuming to exist at all is sufficient to kill one, but
      to see her&mdash;oh my stars!&rsquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      Mrs Todgers laughed immensely at the dear love&rsquo;s humour, and declared she
      was quite afraid of her, that she was. She was so very severe.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Who is severe?&rsquo; cried a voice at the door. &lsquo;There is no such thing as
      severity in our family, I hope!&rsquo; And then Mr Pecksniff peeped smilingly
      into the room, and said, &lsquo;May I come in, Mrs Todgers?&rsquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      Mrs Todgers almost screamed, for the little door of communication between
      that room and the inner one being wide open, there was a full disclosure
      of the sofa bedstead in all its monstrous impropriety. But she had the
      presence of mind to close this portal in the twinkling of an eye; and
      having done so, said, though not without confusion, &lsquo;Oh yes, Mr Pecksniff,
      you can come in, if you please.&rsquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;How are we to-day,&rsquo; said Mr Pecksniff, jocosely, &lsquo;and what are our plans?
      Are we ready to go and see Tom Pinch&rsquo;s sister? Ha, ha, ha! Poor Thomas
      Pinch!&rsquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Are we ready,&rsquo; returned Mrs Todgers, nodding her head with mysterious
      intelligence, &lsquo;to send a favourable reply to Mr Jinkins&rsquo;s round-robin?
      That&rsquo;s the first question, Mr Pecksniff.&rsquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Why Mr Jinkins&rsquo;s robin, my dear madam?&rsquo; asked Mr Pecksniff, putting one
      arm round Mercy, and the other round Mrs Todgers, whom he seemed, in the
      abstraction of the moment, to mistake for Charity. &lsquo;Why Mr Jinkins&rsquo;s?&rsquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Because he began to get it up, and indeed always takes the lead in the
      house,&rsquo; said Mrs Todgers, playfully. &lsquo;That&rsquo;s why, sir.&rsquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Jinkins is a man of superior talents,&rsquo; observed Mr Pecksniff. &lsquo;I have
      conceived a great regard for Jinkins. I take Jinkins&rsquo;s desire to pay
      polite attention to my daughters, as an additional proof of the friendly
      feeling of Jinkins, Mrs Todgers.&rsquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Well now,&rsquo; returned that lady, &lsquo;having said so much, you must say the
      rest, Mr Pecksniff; so tell the dear young ladies all about it.&rsquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      With these words she gently eluded Mr Pecksniff&rsquo;s grasp, and took Miss
      Charity into her own embrace; though whether she was impelled to this
      proceeding solely by the irrepressible affection she had conceived for
      that young lady, or whether it had any reference to a lowering, not to say
      distinctly spiteful expression which had been visible in her face for some
      moments, has never been exactly ascertained. Be this as it may, Mr
      Pecksniff went on to inform his daughters of the purport and history of
      the round-robin aforesaid, which was in brief, that the commercial
      gentlemen who helped to make up the sum and substance of that noun of
      multitude signifying many, called Todgers&rsquo;s, desired the honour of their
      presence at the general table, so long as they remained in the house, and
      besought that they would grace the board at dinner-time next day, the same
      being Sunday. He further said, that Mrs Todgers being a consenting party
      to this invitation, he was willing, for his part, to accept it; and so
      left them that he might write his gracious answer, the while they armed
      themselves with their best bonnets for the utter defeat and overthrow of
      Miss Pinch.
    </p>
    <p>
      Tom Pinch&rsquo;s sister was governess in a family, a lofty family; perhaps the
      wealthiest brass and copper founders&rsquo; family known to mankind. They lived
      at Camberwell; in a house so big and fierce, that its mere outside, like
      the outside of a giant&rsquo;s castle, struck terror into vulgar minds and made
      bold persons quail. There was a great front gate; with a great bell, whose
      handle was in itself a note of admiration; and a great lodge; which being
      close to the house, rather spoilt the look-out certainly but made the
      look-in tremendous. At this entry, a great porter kept constant watch and
      ward; and when he gave the visitor high leave to pass, he rang a second
      great bell, responsive to whose note a great footman appeared in due time
      at the great halldoor, with such great tags upon his liveried shoulder
      that he was perpetually entangling and hooking himself among the chairs
      and tables, and led a life of torment which could scarcely have been
      surpassed, if he had been a blue-bottle in a world of cobwebs.
    </p>
    <p>
      To this mansion Mr Pecksniff, accompanied by his daughters and Mrs
      Todgers, drove gallantly in a one-horse fly. The foregoing ceremonies
      having been all performed, they were ushered into the house; and so, by
      degrees, they got at last into a small room with books in it, where Mr
      Pinch&rsquo;s sister was at that moment instructing her eldest pupil; to wit, a
      premature little woman of thirteen years old, who had already arrived at
      such a pitch of whalebone and education that she had nothing girlish about
      her, which was a source of great rejoicing to all her relations and
      friends.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Visitors for Miss Pinch!&rsquo; said the footman. He must have been an
      ingenious young man, for he said it very cleverly; with a nice
      discrimination between the cold respect with which he would have announced
      visitors to the family, and the warm personal interest with which he would
      have announced visitors to the cook.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Visitors for Miss Pinch!&rsquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      Miss Pinch rose hastily; with such tokens of agitation as plainly declared
      that her list of callers was not numerous. At the same time, the little
      pupil became alarmingly upright, and prepared herself to take mental notes
      of all that might be said and done. For the lady of the establishment was
      curious in the natural history and habits of the animal called Governess,
      and encouraged her daughters to report thereon whenever occasion served;
      which was, in reference to all parties concerned, very laudable,
      improving, and pleasant.

    </h5>
    <p>
      It is a melancholy fact; but it must be related, that Mr Pinch&rsquo;s sister
      was not at all ugly. On the contrary, she had a good face; a very mild and
      prepossessing face; and a pretty little figure&mdash;slight and short, but
      remarkable for its neatness. There was something of her brother, much of
      him indeed, in a certain gentleness of manner, and in her look of timid
      trustfulness; but she was so far from being a fright, or a dowdy, or a
      horror, or anything else, predicted by the two Miss Pecksniffs, that those
      young ladies naturally regarded her with great indignation, feeling that
      this was by no means what they had come to see.
    </p>
    <p>
      Miss Mercy, as having the larger share of gaiety, bore up the best against
      this disappointment, and carried it off, in outward show at least, with a
      titter; but her sister, not caring to hide her disdain, expressed it
      pretty openly in her looks. As to Mrs Todgers, she leaned on Mr
      Pecksniff&rsquo;s arm and preserved a kind of genteel grimness, suitable to any
      state of mind, and involving any shade of opinion.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Don&rsquo;t be alarmed, Miss Pinch,&rsquo; said Mr Pecksniff, taking her hand
      condescendingly in one of his, and patting it with the other. &lsquo;I have
      called to see you, in pursuance of a promise given to your brother, Thomas
      Pinch. My name&mdash;compose yourself, Miss Pinch&mdash;is Pecksniff.&rsquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      The good man emphasised these words as though he would have said, &lsquo;You see
      in me, young person, the benefactor of your race; the patron of your
      house; the preserver of your brother, who is fed with manna daily from my
      table; and in right of whom there is a considerable balance in my favour
      at present standing in the books beyond the sky. But I have no pride, for
      I can afford to do without it!&rsquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      The poor girl felt it all as if it had been Gospel truth. Her brother
      writing in the fullness of his simple heart, had often told her so, and
      how much more! As Mr Pecksniff ceased to speak, she hung her head, and
      dropped a tear upon his hand.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Oh very well, Miss Pinch!&rsquo; thought the sharp pupil, &lsquo;crying before
      strangers, as if you didn&rsquo;t like the situation!&rsquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Thomas is well,&rsquo; said Mr Pecksniff; &lsquo;and sends his love and this letter.
      I cannot say, poor fellow, that he will ever be distinguished in our
      profession; but he has the will to do well, which is the next thing to
      having the power; and, therefore, we must bear with him. Eh?&rsquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;I know he has the will, sir,&rsquo; said Tom Pinch&rsquo;s sister, &lsquo;and I know how
      kindly and considerately you cherish it, for which neither he nor I can
      ever be grateful enough, as we very often say in writing to each other.
      The young ladies too,&rsquo; she added, glancing gratefully at his two
      daughters, &lsquo;I know how much we owe to them.&rsquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;My dears,&rsquo; said Mr Pecksniff, turning to them with a smile: &lsquo;Thomas&rsquo;s
      sister is saying something you will be glad to hear, I think.&rsquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;We can&rsquo;t take any merit to ourselves, papa!&rsquo; cried Cherry, as they both
      apprised Tom Pinch&rsquo;s sister, with a curtsey, that they would feel obliged
      if she would keep her distance. &lsquo;Mr Pinch&rsquo;s being so well provided for is
      owing to you alone, and we can only say how glad we are to hear that he is
      as grateful as he ought to be.&rsquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Oh very well, Miss Pinch!&rsquo; thought the pupil again. &lsquo;Got a grateful
      brother, living on other people&rsquo;s kindness!&rsquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;It was very kind of you,&rsquo; said Tom Pinch&rsquo;s sister, with Tom&rsquo;s own
      simplicity and Tom&rsquo;s own smile, &lsquo;to come here; very kind indeed; though
      how great a kindness you have done me in gratifying my wish to see you,
      and to thank you with my own lips, you, who make so light of benefits
      conferred, can scarcely think.&rsquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Very grateful; very pleasant; very proper,&rsquo; murmured Mr Pecksniff.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;It makes me happy too,&rsquo; said Ruth Pinch, who now that her first surprise
      was over, had a chatty, cheerful way with her, and a single-hearted desire
      to look upon the best side of everything, which was the very moral and
      image of Tom; &lsquo;very happy to think that you will be able to tell him how
      more than comfortably I am situated here, and how unnecessary it is that
      he should ever waste a regret on my being cast upon my own resources. Dear
      me! So long as I heard that he was happy, and he heard that I was,&rsquo; said
      Tom&rsquo;s sister, &lsquo;we could both bear, without one impatient or complaining
      thought, a great deal more than ever we have had to endure, I am very
      certain.&rsquo; And if ever the plain truth were spoken on this occasionally
      false earth, Tom&rsquo;s sister spoke it when she said that.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Ah!&rsquo; cried Mr Pecksniff whose eyes had in the meantime wandered to the
      pupil; &lsquo;certainly. And how do <i>you </i>do, my very interesting child?&rsquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Quite well, I thank you, sir,&rsquo; replied that frosty innocent.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;A sweet face this, my dears,&rsquo; said Mr Pecksniff, turning to his
      daughters. &lsquo;A charming manner!&rsquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      Both young ladies had been in ecstasies with the scion of a wealthy house
      (through whom the nearest road and shortest cut to her parents might be
      supposed to lie) from the first. Mrs Todgers vowed that anything one
      quarter so angelic she had never seen. &lsquo;She wanted but a pair of wings, a
      dear,&rsquo; said that good woman, &lsquo;to be a young syrup&rsquo;&mdash;meaning,
      possibly, young sylph, or seraph.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;If you will give that to your distinguished parents, my amiable little
      friend,&rsquo; said Mr Pecksniff, producing one of his professional cards, &lsquo;and
      will say that I and my daughters&mdash;&rsquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;And Mrs Todgers, pa,&rsquo; said Merry.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;And Mrs Todgers, of London,&rsquo; added Mr Pecksniff; &lsquo;that I, and my
      daughters, and Mrs Todgers, of London, did not intrude upon them, as our
      object simply was to take some notice of Miss Pinch, whose brother is a
      young man in my employment; but that I could not leave this very chaste
      mansion, without adding my humble tribute, as an Architect, to the
      correctness and elegance of the owner&rsquo;s taste, and to his just
      appreciation of that beautiful art to the cultivation of which I have
      devoted a life, and to the promotion of whose glory and advancement I have
      sacrified a&mdash;a fortune&mdash;I shall be very much obliged to you.&rsquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Missis&rsquo;s compliments to Miss Pinch,&rsquo; said the footman, suddenly
      appearing, and speaking in exactly the same key as before, &lsquo;and begs to
      know wot my young lady is a-learning of just now.&rsquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Oh!&rsquo; said Mr Pecksniff, &lsquo;Here is the young man. <i>he</i> will take the card.
      With my compliments, if you please, young man. My dears, we are
      interrupting the studies. Let us go.&rsquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      Some confusion was occasioned for an instant by Mrs Todgers&rsquo;s unstrapping
      her little flat hand-basket, and hurriedly entrusting the &lsquo;young man&rsquo; with
      one of her own cards, which, in addition to certain detailed information
      relative to the terms of the commercial establishment, bore a foot-note to
      the effect that M. T. took that opportunity of thanking those gentlemen
      who had honoured her with their favours, and begged they would have the
      goodness, if satisfied with the table, to recommend her to their friends.
      But Mr Pecksniff, with admirable presence of mind, recovered this
      document, and buttoned it up in his own pocket.
    </p>
    <p>
      Then he said to Miss Pinch&mdash;with more condescension and kindness than
      ever, for it was desirable the footman should expressly understand that
      they were not friends of hers, but patrons:
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Good morning. Good-bye. God bless you! You may depend upon my continued
      protection of your brother Thomas. Keep your mind quite at ease, Miss
      Pinch!&rsquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Thank you,&rsquo; said Tom&rsquo;s sister heartily; &lsquo;a thousand times.&rsquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Not at all,&rsquo; he retorted, patting her gently on the head. &lsquo;Don&rsquo;t mention
      it. You will make me angry if you do. My sweet child&rsquo;&mdash;to the pupil&mdash;&lsquo;farewell!
      That fairy creature,&rsquo; said Mr Pecksniff, looking in his pensive mood hard
      at the footman, as if he meant him, &lsquo;has shed a vision on my path,
      refulgent in its nature, and not easily to be obliterated. My dears, are
      you ready?&rsquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      They were not quite ready yet, for they were still caressing the pupil.
      But they tore themselves away at length; and sweeping past Miss Pinch with
      each a haughty inclination of the head and a curtsey strangled in its
      birth, flounced into the passage.
    </p>
    <p>
      The young man had rather a long job in showing them out; for Mr
      Pecksniff&rsquo;s delight in the tastefulness of the house was such that he
      could not help often stopping (particularly when they were near the
      parlour door) and giving it expression, in a loud voice and very learned
      terms. Indeed, he delivered, between the study and the hall, a familiar
      exposition of the whole science of architecture as applied to
      dwelling-houses, and was yet in the freshness of his eloquence when they
      reached the garden.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;If you look,&rsquo; said Mr Pecksniff, backing from the steps, with his head on
      one side and his eyes half-shut that he might the better take in the
      proportions of the exterior: &lsquo;If you look, my dears, at the cornice which
      supports the roof, and observe the airiness of its construction,
      especially where it sweeps the southern angle of the building, you will
      feel with me&mdash;How do you do, sir? I hope you&rsquo;re well?&rsquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      Interrupting himself with these words, he very politely bowed to a
      middle-aged gentleman at an upper window, to whom he spoke&mdash;not
      because the gentleman could hear him (for he certainly could not), but as
      an appropriate accompaniment to his salutation.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;I have no doubt, my dears,&rsquo; said Mr Pecksniff, feigning to point out
      other beauties with his hand, &lsquo;that this is the proprietor. I should be
      glad to know him. It might lead to something. Is he looking this way,
      Charity?&rsquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;He is opening the window pa!&rsquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Ha, ha!&rsquo; cried Mr Pecksniff softly. &lsquo;All right! He has found I&rsquo;m
      professional. He heard me inside just now, I have no doubt. Don&rsquo;t look!
      With regard to the fluted pillars in the portico, my dears&mdash;&rsquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Hallo!&rsquo; cried the gentleman.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Sir, your servant!&rsquo; said Mr Pecksniff, taking off his hat. &lsquo;I am proud to
      make your acquaintance.&rsquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Come off the grass, will you!&rsquo; roared the gentleman.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;I beg your pardon, sir,&rsquo; said Mr Pecksniff, doubtful of his having heard
      aright. &lsquo;Did you&mdash;?&rsquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Come off the grass!&rsquo; repeated the gentleman, warmly.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;We are unwilling to intrude, sir,&rsquo; Mr Pecksniff smilingly began.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;But you <i>are </i>intruding,&rsquo; returned the other, &lsquo;unwarrantably intruding.
      Trespassing. You see a gravel walk, don&rsquo;t you? What do you think it&rsquo;s
      meant for? Open the gate there! Show that party out!&rsquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      With that he clapped down the window again, and disappeared.
    </p>
    <p>
      Mr Pecksniff put on his hat, and walked with great deliberation and in
      profound silence to the fly, gazing at the clouds as he went, with great
      interest. After helping his daughters and Mrs Todgers into that
      conveyance, he stood looking at it for some moments, as if he were not
      quite certain whether it was a carriage or a temple; but having settled
      this point in his mind, he got into his place, spread his hands out on his
      knees, and smiled upon the three beholders.
    </p>
    <p>
      But his daughters, less tranquil-minded, burst into a torrent of
      indignation. This came, they said, of cherishing such creatures as the
      Pinches. This came of lowering themselves to their level. This came of
      putting themselves in the humiliating position of seeming to know such
      bold, audacious, cunning, dreadful girls as that. They had expected this.
      They had predicted it to Mrs Todgers, as she (Todgers) could depone, that
      very morning. To this, they added, that the owner of the house, supposing
      them to be Miss Pinch&rsquo;s friends, had acted, in their opinion, quite
      correctly, and had done no more than, under such circumstances, might
      reasonably have been expected. To that they added (with a trifling
      inconsistency), that he was a brute and a bear; and then they merged into
      a flood of tears, which swept away all wandering epithets before it.
    </p>
    <p>
      Perhaps Miss Pinch was scarcely so much to blame in the matter as the
      Seraph, who, immediately on the withdrawal of the visitors, had hastened
      to report them at head-quarters, with a full account of their having
      presumptuously charged her with the delivery of a message afterwards
      consigned to the footman; which outrage, taken in conjunction with Mr
      Pecksniff&rsquo;s unobtrusive remarks on the establishment, might possibly have
      had some share in their dismissal. Poor Miss Pinch, however, had to bear
      the brunt of it with both parties; being so severely taken to task by the
      Seraph&rsquo;s mother for having such vulgar acquaintances, that she was fain to
      retire to her own room in tears, which her natural cheerfulness and
      submission, and the delight of having seen Mr Pecksniff, and having
      received a letter from her brother, were at first insufficient to repress.
    </p>
    <p>
      As to Mr Pecksniff, he told them in the fly, that a good action was its
      own reward; and rather gave them to understand, that if he could have been
      kicked in such a cause, he would have liked it all the better. But this
      was no comfort to the young ladies, who scolded violently the whole way
      back, and even exhibited, more than once, a keen desire to attack the
      devoted Mrs Todgers; on whose personal appearance, but particularly on
      whose offending card and hand-basket, they were secretly inclined to lay
      the blame of half their failure.
    </p>
    <p>
      Todgers&rsquo;s was in a great bustle that evening, partly owing to some
      additional domestic preparations for the morrow, and partly to the
      excitement always inseparable in that house from Saturday night, when
      every gentleman&rsquo;s linen arrived at a different hour in its own little
      bundle, with his private account pinned on the outside. There was always a
      great clinking of pattens downstairs, too, until midnight or so, on
      Saturdays; together with a frequent gleaming of mysterious lights in the
      area; much working at the pump; and a constant jangling of the iron handle
      of the pail. Shrill altercations from time to time arose between Mrs
      Todgers and unknown females in remote back kitchens; and sounds were
      occasionally heard, indicative of small articles of iron mongery and
      hardware being thrown at the boy. It was the custom of that youth on
      Saturdays, to roll up his shirt sleeves to his shoulders, and pervade all
      parts of the house in an apron of coarse green baize; moreover, he was
      more strongly tempted on Saturdays than on other days (it being a busy
      time), to make excursive bolts into the neighbouring alleys when he
      answered the door, and there to play at leap-frog and other sports with
      vagrant lads, until pursued and brought back by the hair of his head or
      the lobe of his ear; thus he was quite a conspicuous feature among the
      peculiar incidents of the last day in the week at Todgers&rsquo;s.
    </p>
    <p>
      He was especially so on this particular Saturday evening, and honoured the
      Miss Pecksniffs with a deal of notice; seldom passing the door of Mrs
      Todgers&rsquo;s private room, where they sat alone before the fire, working by
      the light of a solitary candle, without putting in his head and greeting
      them with some such compliments as, &lsquo;There you are agin!&rsquo; &lsquo;An&rsquo;t it nice?&rsquo;&mdash;and
      similar humorous attentions.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;I say,&rsquo; he whispered, stopping in one of his journeys to and fro, &lsquo;young
      ladies, there&rsquo;s soup to-morrow. She&rsquo;s a-making it now. An&rsquo;t she a-putting
      in the water? Oh! not at all neither!&rsquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      In the course of answering another knock, he thrust in his head again.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;I say! There&rsquo;s fowls to-morrow. Not skinny ones. Oh no!&rsquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      Presently he called through the key-hole:
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;There&rsquo;s a fish to-morrow. Just come. Don&rsquo;t eat none of him!&rsquo; And, with
      this special warning, vanished again.
    </p>
    <p>
      By-and-bye, he returned to lay the cloth for supper; it having been
      arranged between Mrs Todgers and the young ladies, that they should
      partake of an exclusive veal-cutlet together in the privacy of that
      apartment. He entertained them on this occasion by thrusting the lighted
      candle into his mouth, and exhibiting his face in a state of transparency;
      after the performance of which feat, he went on with his professional
      duties; brightening every knife as he laid it on the table, by breathing
      on the blade and afterwards polishing the same on the apron already
      mentioned. When he had completed his preparations, he grinned at the
      sisters, and expressed his belief that the approaching collation would be
      of &lsquo;rather a spicy sort.&rsquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Will it be long, before it&rsquo;s ready, Bailey?&rsquo; asked Mercy.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;No,&rsquo; said Bailey, &lsquo;it <i>is</i> cooked. When I come up, she was dodging among
      the tender pieces with a fork, and eating of &lsquo;em.&rsquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      But he had scarcely achieved the utterance of these words, when he
      received a manual compliment on the head, which sent him staggering
      against the wall; and Mrs Todgers, dish in hand, stood indignantly before
      him.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Oh you little villain!&rsquo; said that lady. &lsquo;Oh you bad, false boy!&rsquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;No worse than yerself,&rsquo; retorted Bailey, guarding his head, on a
      principle invented by Mr Thomas Cribb. &lsquo;Ah! Come now! Do that again, will
      yer?&rsquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;He&rsquo;s the most dreadful child,&rsquo; said Mrs Todgers, setting down the dish,
      &lsquo;I ever had to deal with. The gentlemen spoil him to that extent, and
      teach him such things, that I&rsquo;m afraid nothing but hanging will ever do
      him any good.&rsquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Won&rsquo;t it!&rsquo; cried Bailey. &lsquo;Oh! Yes! Wot do you go a-lowerin the table-beer
      for then, and destroying my constitooshun?&rsquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Go downstairs, you vicious boy,&rsquo; said Mrs Todgers, holding the door open.
      &lsquo;Do you hear me? Go along!&rsquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      After two or three dexterous feints, he went, and was seen no more that
      night, save once, when he brought up some tumblers and hot water, and much
      disturbed the two Miss Pecksniffs by squinting hideously behind the back
      of the unconscious Mrs Todgers. Having done this justice to his wounded
      feelings, he retired underground; where, in company with a swarm of black
      beetles and a kitchen candle, he employed his faculties in cleaning boots
      and brushing clothes until the night was far advanced.
    </p>
    <p>
      Benjamin was supposed to be the real name of this young retainer but he
      was known by a great variety of names. Benjamin, for instance, had been
      converted into Uncle Ben, and that again had been corrupted into Uncle;
      which, by an easy transition, had again passed into Barnwell, in memory of
      the celebrated relative in that degree who was shot by his nephew George,
      while meditating in his garden at Camberwell. The gentlemen at Todgers&rsquo;s
      had a merry habit, too, of bestowing upon him, for the time being, the
      name of any notorious malefactor or minister; and sometimes when current
      events were flat they even sought the pages of history for these
      distinctions; as Mr Pitt, Young Brownrigg, and the like. At the period of
      which we write, he was generally known among the gentlemen as Bailey
      junior; a name bestowed upon him in contradistinction, perhaps, to Old
      Bailey; and possibly as involving the recollection of an unfortunate lady
      of the same name, who perished by her own hand early in life, and has been
      immortalised in a ballad.
    </p>
    <p>
      The usual Sunday dinner-hour at Todgers&rsquo;s was two o&rsquo;clock&mdash;a suitable
      time, it was considered for all parties; convenient to Mrs Todgers, on
      account of the bakers; and convenient to the gentlemen with reference to
      their afternoon engagements. But on the Sunday which was to introduce the
      two Miss Pecksniffs to a full knowledge of Todgers&rsquo;s and its society, the
      dinner was postponed until five, in order that everything might be as
      genteel as the occasion demanded.
    </p>
    <p>
      When the hour drew nigh, Bailey junior, testifying great excitement,
      appeared in a complete suit of cast-off clothes several sizes too large
      for him, and in particular, mounted a clean shirt of such extraordinary
      magnitude, that one of the gentlemen (remarkable for his ready wit) called
      him &lsquo;collars&rsquo; on the spot. At about a quarter before five, a deputation,
      consisting of Mr Jinkins, and another gentleman, whose name was Gander,
      knocked at the door of Mrs Todgers&rsquo;s room, and, being formally introduced
      to the two Miss Pecksniffs by their parent who was in waiting, besought
      the honour of conducting them upstairs.
    </p>
    <p>
      The drawing-room at Todgers&rsquo;s was out of the common style; so much so
      indeed, that you would hardly have taken it to be a drawingroom, unless
      you were told so by somebody who was in the secret. It was floor-clothed
      all over; and the ceiling, including a great beam in the middle, was
      papered. Besides the three little windows, with seats in them, commanding
      the opposite archway, there was another window looking point blank,
      without any compromise at all about it into Jinkins&rsquo;s bedroom; and high
      up, all along one side of the wall was a strip of panes of glass,
      two-deep, giving light to the staircase. There were the oddest closets
      possible, with little casements in them like eight-day clocks, lurking in
      the wainscot and taking the shape of the stairs; and the very door itself
      (which was painted black) had two great glass eyes in its forehead, with
      an inquisitive green pupil in the middle of each.
    </p>
    <p>
      Here the gentlemen were all assembled. There was a general cry of &lsquo;Hear,
      hear!&rsquo; and &lsquo;Bravo Jink!&rsquo; when Mr Jinkins appeared with Charity on his arm;
      which became quite rapturous as Mr Gander followed, escorting Mercy, and
      Mr Pecksniff brought up the rear with Mrs Todgers.
    </p>
    <p>
      Then the presentations took place. They included a gentleman of a sporting
      turn, who propounded questions on jockey subjects to the editors of Sunday
      papers, which were regarded by his friends as rather stiff things to
      answer; and they included a gentleman of a theatrical turn, who had once
      entertained serious thoughts of &lsquo;coming out,&rsquo; but had been kept in by the
      wickedness of human nature; and they included a gentleman of a debating
      turn, who was strong at speech-making; and a gentleman of a literary turn,
      who wrote squibs upon the rest, and knew the weak side of everybody&rsquo;s
      character but his own. There was a gentleman of a vocal turn, and a
      gentleman of a smoking turn, and a gentleman of a convivial turn; some of
      the gentlemen had a turn for whist, and a large proportion of the
      gentlemen had a strong turn for billiards and betting. They had all, it
      may be presumed, a turn for business; being all commercially employed in
      one way or other; and had, every one in his own way, a decided turn for
      pleasure to boot. Mr Jinkins was of a fashionable turn; being a regular
      frequenter of the Parks on Sundays, and knowing a great many carriages by
      sight. He spoke mysteriously, too, of splendid women, and was suspected of
      having once committed himself with a Countess. Mr Gander was of a witty
      turn being indeed the gentleman who had originated the sally about
      &lsquo;collars;&rsquo; which sparkling pleasantry was now retailed from mouth to
      mouth, under the title of Gander&rsquo;s Last, and was received in all parts of
      the room with great applause. Mr Jinkins it may be added, was much the
      oldest of the party; being a fish-salesman&rsquo;s book-keeper, aged forty. He
      was the oldest boarder also; and in right of his double seniority, took
      the lead in the house, as Mrs Todgers had already said.
    </p>
    <p>
      There was considerable delay in the production of dinner, and poor Mrs
      Todgers, being reproached in confidence by Jinkins, slipped in and out, at
      least twenty times to see about it; always coming back as though she had
      no such thing upon her mind, and hadn&rsquo;t been out at all. But there was no
      hitch in the conversation nevertheless; for one gentleman, who travelled
      in the perfumery line, exhibited an interesting nick-nack, in the way of a
      remarkable cake of shaving soap which he had lately met with in Germany;
      and the gentleman of a literary turn repeated (by desire) some sarcastic
      stanzas he had recently produced on the freezing of the tank at the back
      of the house. These amusements, with the miscellaneous conversation
      arising out of them, passed the time splendidly, until dinner was
      announced by Bailey junior in these terms:
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;The wittles is up!&rsquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      On which notice they immediately descended to the banquet-hall; some of
      the more facetious spirits in the rear taking down gentlemen as if they
      were ladies, in imitation of the fortunate possessors of the two Miss
      Pecksniffs.
    </p>
    <p>
      Mr Pecksniff said grace&mdash;a short and pious grace, involving a
      blessing on the appetites of those present, and committing all persons who
      had nothing to eat, to the care of Providence; whose business (so said the
      grace, in effect) it clearly was, to look after them. This done, they fell
      to with less ceremony than appetite; the table groaning beneath the
      weight, not only of the delicacies whereof the Miss Pecksniffs had been
      previously forewarned, but of boiled beef, roast veal, bacon, pies and
      abundance of such heavy vegetables as are favourably known to housekeepers
      for their satisfying qualities. Besides which, there were bottles of
      stout, bottles of wine, bottles of ale, and divers other strong drinks,
      native and foreign.
    </p>
    <p>
      All this was highly agreeable to the two Miss Pecksniffs, who were in
      immense request; sitting one on either hand of Mr Jinkins at the bottom of
      the table; and who were called upon to take wine with some new admirer
      every minute. They had hardly ever felt so pleasant, and so full of
      conversation, in their lives; Mercy, in particular, was uncommonly
      brilliant, and said so many good things in the way of lively repartee that
      she was looked upon as a prodigy. &lsquo;In short,&rsquo; as that young lady observed,
      &lsquo;they felt now, indeed, that they were in London, and for the first time
      too.&rsquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      Their young friend Bailey sympathized in these feelings to the fullest
      extent, and, abating nothing of his patronage, gave them every
      encouragement in his power; favouring them, when the general attention was
      diverted from his proceedings, with many nods and winks and other tokens
      of recognition, and occasionally touching his nose with a corkscrew, as if
      to express the Bacchanalian character of the meeting. In truth, perhaps
      even the spirits of the two Miss Pecksniffs, and the hungry watchfulness
      of Mrs Todgers, were less worthy of note than the proceedings of this
      remarkable boy, whom nothing disconcerted or put out of his way. If any
      piece of crockery, a dish or otherwise, chanced to slip through his hands
      (which happened once or twice), he let it go with perfect good breeding,
      and never added to the painful emotions of the company by exhibiting the
      least regret. Nor did he, by hurrying to and fro, disturb the repose of
      the assembly, as many well-trained servants do; on the contrary, feeling
      the hopelessness of waiting upon so large a party, he left the gentlemen
      to help themselves to what they wanted, and seldom stirred from behind Mr
      Jinkins&rsquo;s chair, where, with his hands in his pockets, and his legs
      planted pretty wide apart, he led the laughter, and enjoyed the
      conversation.
    </p>
    <p>
      The dessert was splendid. No waiting either. The pudding-plates had been
      washed in a little tub outside the door while cheese was on, and though
      they were moist and warm with friction, still there they were again, up to
      the mark, and true to time. Quarts of almonds; dozens of oranges; pounds
      of raisins; stacks of biffins; soup-plates full of nuts.&mdash;Oh,
      Todgers&rsquo;s could do it when it chose! mind that.
    </p>
    <p>
      Then more wine came on; red wines and white wines; and a large china bowl
      of punch, brewed by the gentleman of a convivial turn, who adjured the
      Miss Pecksniffs not to be despondent on account of its dimensions, as
      there were materials in the house for the decoction of half a dozen more
      of the same size. Good gracious, how they laughed! How they coughed when
      they sipped it, because it was so strong; and how they laughed again when
      somebody vowed that but for its colour it might have been mistaken, in
      regard of its innocuous qualities, for new milk! What a shout of &lsquo;No!&rsquo;
      burst from the gentlemen when they pathetically implored Mr Jinkins to
      suffer them to qualify it with hot water; and how blushingly, by little
      and little, did each of them drink her whole glassful, down to its very
      dregs!
    </p>
    <p>
      Now comes the trying time. The sun, as Mr Jinkins says (gentlemanly
      creature, Jinkins&mdash;never at a loss!), is about to leave the
      firmament. &lsquo;Miss Pecksniff!&rsquo; says Mrs Todgers, softly, &lsquo;will you&mdash;?&rsquo;
      &lsquo;Oh dear, no more, Mrs Todgers.&rsquo; Mrs Todgers rises; the two Miss
      Pecksniffs rise; all rise. Miss Mercy Pecksniff looks downward for her
      scarf. Where is it? Dear me, where <i>can </i>it be? Sweet girl, she has it on;
      not on her fair neck, but loose upon her flowing figure. A dozen hands
      assist her. She is all confusion. The youngest gentleman in company
      thirsts to murder Jinkins. She skips and joins her sister at the door. Her
      sister has her arm about the waist of Mrs Todgers. She winds her arm
      around her sister. Diana, what a picture! The last things visible are a
      shape and a skip. &lsquo;Gentlemen, let us drink the ladies!&rsquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      The enthusiasm is tremendous. The gentleman of a debating turn rises in
      the midst, and suddenly lets loose a tide of eloquence which bears down
      everything before it. He is reminded of a toast&mdash;a toast to which
      they will respond. There is an individual present; he has him in his eye;
      to whom they owe a debt of gratitude. He repeats it&mdash;a debt of
      gratitude. Their rugged natures have been softened and ameliorated that
      day, by the society of lovely woman. There is a gentleman in company whom
      two accomplished and delightful females regard with veneration, as the
      fountain of their existence. Yes, when yet the two Miss Pecksniffs lisped
      in language scarce intelligible, they called that individual &lsquo;Father!&rsquo;
      There is great applause. He gives them &lsquo;Mr Pecksniff, and God bless him!&rsquo;
      They all shake hands with Mr Pecksniff, as they drink the toast. The
      youngest gentleman in company does so with a thrill; for he feels that a
      mysterious influence pervades the man who claims that being in the pink
      scarf for his daughter.
    </p>
    <p>
      What saith Mr Pecksniff in reply? Or rather let the question be, What
      leaves he unsaid? Nothing. More punch is called for, and produced, and
      drunk. Enthusiasm mounts still higher. Every man comes out freely in his
      own character. The gentleman of a theatrical turn recites. The vocal
      gentleman regales them with a song. Gander leaves the Gander of all former
      feasts whole leagues behind. <i>he</i> rises to propose a toast. It is, The
      Father of Todgers&rsquo;s. It is their common friend Jink&mdash;it is old Jink,
      if he may call him by that familiar and endearing appellation. The
      youngest gentleman in company utters a frantic negative. He won&rsquo;t have it&mdash;he
      can&rsquo;t bear it&mdash;it mustn&rsquo;t be. But his depth of feeling is
      misunderstood. He is supposed to be a little elevated; and nobody heeds
      him.
    </p>
    <p>
      Mr Jinkins thanks them from his heart. It is, by many degrees, the
      proudest day in his humble career. When he looks around him on the present
      occasion, he feels that he wants words in which to express his gratitude.
      One thing he will say. He hopes it has been shown that Todgers&rsquo;s can be
      true to itself; and that, an opportunity arising, it can come out quite as
      strong as its neighbours&mdash;perhaps stronger. He reminds them, amidst
      thunders of encouragement, that they have heard of a somewhat similar
      establishment in Cannon Street; and that they have heard it praised. He
      wishes to draw no invidious comparisons; he would be the last man to do
      it; but when that Cannon Street establishment shall be able to produce
      such a combination of wit and beauty as has graced that board that day,
      and shall be able to serve up (all things considered) such a dinner as
      that of which they have just partaken, he will be happy to talk to it.
      Until then, gentlemen, he will stick to Todgers&rsquo;s.
    </p>
    <p>
      More punch, more enthusiasm, more speeches. Everybody&rsquo;s health is drunk,
      saving the youngest gentleman&rsquo;s in company. He sits apart, with his elbow
      on the back of a vacant chair, and glares disdainfully at Jinkins. Gander,
      in a convulsing speech, gives them the health of Bailey junior; hiccups
      are heard; and a glass is broken. Mr Jinkins feels that it is time to join
      the ladies. He proposes, as a final sentiment, Mrs Todgers. She is worthy
      to be remembered separately. Hear, hear. So she is; no doubt of it. They
      all find fault with her at other times; but every man feels now, that he
      could die in her defence.
    </p>
    <p>
      They go upstairs, where they are not expected so soon; for Mrs Todgers is
      asleep, Miss Charity is adjusting her hair, and Mercy, who has made a sofa
      of one of the window-seats is in a gracefully recumbent attitude. She is
      rising hastily, when Mr Jinkins implores her, for all their sakes, not to
      stir; she looks too graceful and too lovely, he remarks, to be disturbed.
      She laughs, and yields, and fans herself, and drops her fan, and there is
      a rush to pick it up. Being now installed, by one consent, as the beauty
      of the party, she is cruel and capricious, and sends gentlemen on messages
      to other gentlemen, and forgets all about them before they can return with
      the answer, and invents a thousand tortures, rending their hearts to
      pieces. Bailey brings up the tea and coffee. There is a small cluster of
      admirers round Charity; but they are only those who cannot get near her
      sister. The youngest gentleman in company is pale, but collected, and
      still sits apart; for his spirit loves to hold communion with itself, and
      his soul recoils from noisy revellers. She has a consciousness of his
      presence and adoration. He sees it flashing sometimes in the corner of her
      eye. Have a care, Jinkins, ere you provoke a desperate man to frenzy!
    </p>
    <p>
      Mr Pecksniff had followed his younger friends upstairs, and taken a chair
      at the side of Mrs Todgers. He had also spilt a cup of coffee over his
      legs without appearing to be aware of the circumstance; nor did he seem to
      know that there was muffin on his knee.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;And how have they used you downstairs, sir?&rsquo; asked the hostess.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Their conduct has been such, my dear madam,&rsquo; said Mr Pecksniff, &lsquo;as I can
      never think of without emotion, or remember without a tear. Oh, Mrs
      Todgers!&rsquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;My goodness!&rsquo; exclaimed that lady. &lsquo;How low you are in your spirits,
      sir!&rsquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;I am a man, my dear madam,&rsquo; said Mr Pecksniff, shedding tears and
      speaking with an imperfect articulation, &lsquo;but I am also a father. I am
      also a widower. My feelings, Mrs Todgers, will not consent to be entirely
      smothered, like the young children in the Tower. They are grown up, and
      the more I press the bolster on them, the more they look round the corner
      of it.&rsquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      He suddenly became conscious of the bit of muffin, and stared at it
      intently; shaking his head the while, in a forlorn and imbecile manner, as
      if he regarded it as his evil genius, and mildly reproached it.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;She was beautiful, Mrs Todgers,&rsquo; he said, turning his glazed eye again
      upon her, without the least preliminary notice. &lsquo;She had a small
      property.&rsquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;So I have heard,&rsquo; cried Mrs Todgers with great sympathy.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Those are her daughters,&rsquo; said Mr Pecksniff, pointing out the young
      ladies, with increased emotion.
    </p>
    <p>
      Mrs Todgers had no doubt about it.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Mercy and Charity,&rsquo; said Mr Pecksniff, &lsquo;Charity and Mercy. Not unholy
      names, I hope?&rsquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Mr Pecksniff!&rsquo; cried Mrs Todgers. &lsquo;What a ghastly smile! Are you ill,
      sir?&rsquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      He pressed his hand upon her arm, and answered in a solemn manner, and a
      faint voice, &lsquo;Chronic.&rsquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Cholic?&rsquo; cried the frightened Mrs Todgers.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Chron-ic,&rsquo; he repeated with some difficulty. &lsquo;Chron-ic. A chronic
      disorder. I have been its victim from childhood. It is carrying me to my
      grave.&rsquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Heaven forbid!&rsquo; cried Mrs Todgers.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Yes, it is,&rsquo; said Mr Pecksniff, reckless with despair. &lsquo;I am rather glad
      of it, upon the whole. You are like her, Mrs Todgers.&rsquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Don&rsquo;t squeeze me so tight, pray, Mr Pecksniff. If any of the gentlemen
      should notice us.&rsquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;For her sake,&rsquo; said Mr Pecksniff. &lsquo;Permit me&mdash;in honour of her
      memory. For the sake of a voice from the tomb. You are <i>very </i>like her Mrs
      Todgers! What a world this is!&rsquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Ah! Indeed you may say that!&rsquo; cried Mrs Todgers.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;I&rsquo;m afraid it is a vain and thoughtless world,&rsquo; said Mr Pecksniff,
      overflowing with despondency. &lsquo;These young people about us. Oh! what sense
      have they of their responsibilities? None. Give me your other hand, Mrs
      Todgers.&rsquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      The lady hesitated, and said &lsquo;she didn&rsquo;t like.&rsquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Has a voice from the grave no influence?&rsquo; said Mr Pecksniff, with, dismal
      tenderness. &lsquo;This is irreligious! My dear creature.&rsquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Hush!&rsquo; urged Mrs Todgers. &lsquo;Really you mustn&rsquo;t.&rsquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;It&rsquo;s not me,&rsquo; said Mr Pecksniff. &lsquo;Don&rsquo;t suppose it&rsquo;s me; it&rsquo;s the voice;
      it&rsquo;s her voice.&rsquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      Mrs Pecksniff deceased, must have had an unusually thick and husky voice
      for a lady, and rather a stuttering voice, and to say the truth somewhat
      of a drunken voice, if it had ever borne much resemblance to that in which
      Mr Pecksniff spoke just then. But perhaps this was delusion on his part.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;It has been a day of enjoyment, Mrs Todgers, but still it has been a day
      of torture. It has reminded me of my loneliness. What am I in the world?&rsquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;An excellent gentleman, Mr Pecksniff,&rsquo; said Mrs Todgers.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;There is consolation in that too,&rsquo; cried Mr Pecksniff. &lsquo;Am I?&rsquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;There is no better man living,&rsquo; said Mrs Todgers, &lsquo;I am sure.&rsquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      Mr Pecksniff smiled through his tears, and slightly shook his head. &lsquo;You
      are very good,&rsquo; he said, &lsquo;thank you. It is a great happiness to me, Mrs
      Todgers, to make young people happy. The happiness of my pupils is my
      chief object. I dote upon &lsquo;em. They dote upon me too&mdash;sometimes.&rsquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Always,&rsquo; said Mrs Todgers.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;When they say they haven&rsquo;t improved, ma&rsquo;am,&rsquo; whispered Mr Pecksniff,
      looking at her with profound mystery, and motioning to her to advance her
      ear a little closer to his mouth. &lsquo;When they say they haven&rsquo;t improved,
      ma&rsquo;am, and the premium was too high, they lie! I shouldn&rsquo;t wish it to be
      mentioned; you will understand me; but I say to you as to an old friend,
      they lie.&rsquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Base wretches they must be!&rsquo; said Mrs Todgers.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Madam,&rsquo; said Mr Pecksniff, &lsquo;you are right. I respect you for that
      observation. A word in your ear. To Parents and Guardians. This is in
      confidence, Mrs Todgers?&rsquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;The strictest, of course!&rsquo; cried that lady.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;To Parents and Guardians,&rsquo; repeated Mr Pecksniff. &lsquo;An eligible
      opportunity now offers, which unites the advantages of the best practical
      architectural education with the comforts of a home, and the constant
      association with some, who, however humble their sphere and limited their
      capacity&mdash;observe!&mdash;are not unmindful of their moral
      responsibilities.&rsquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      Mrs Todgers looked a little puzzled to know what this might mean, as well
      she might; for it was, as the reader may perchance remember, Mr
      Pecksniff&rsquo;s usual form of advertisement when he wanted a pupil; and seemed
      to have no particular reference, at present, to anything. But Mr Pecksniff
      held up his finger as a caution to her not to interrupt him.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Do you know any parent or guardian, Mrs Todgers,&rsquo; said Mr Pecksniff, &lsquo;who
      desires to avail himself of such an opportunity for a young gentleman? An
      orphan would be preferred. Do you know of any orphan with three or four
      hundred pound?&rsquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      Mrs Todgers reflected, and shook her head.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;When you hear of an orphan with three or four hundred pound,&rsquo; said Mr
      Pecksniff, &lsquo;let that dear orphan&rsquo;s friends apply, by letter post-paid, to
      S. P., Post Office, Salisbury. I don&rsquo;t know who he is exactly. Don&rsquo;t be
      alarmed, Mrs Todgers,&rsquo; said Mr Pecksniff, falling heavily against her;
      &lsquo;Chronic&mdash;chronic! Let&rsquo;s have a little drop of something to drink.&rsquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Bless my life, Miss Pecksniffs!&rsquo; cried Mrs Todgers, aloud, &lsquo;your dear
      pa&rsquo;s took very poorly!&rsquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      Mr Pecksniff straightened himself by a surprising effort, as every one
      turned hastily towards him; and standing on his feet, regarded the
      assembly with a look of ineffable wisdom. Gradually it gave place to a
      smile; a feeble, helpless, melancholy smile; bland, almost to sickliness.
      &lsquo;Do not repine, my friends,&rsquo; said Mr Pecksniff, tenderly. &lsquo;Do not weep for
      me. It is chronic.&rsquo; And with these words, after making a futile attempt to
      pull off his shoes, he fell into the fireplace.
    </p>
    <p>
      The youngest gentleman in company had him out in a second. Yes, before a
      hair upon his head was singed, he had him on the hearth-rug&mdash;her
      father!
    </p>
    <p>
      She was almost beside herself. So was her sister. Jinkins consoled them
      both. They all consoled them. Everybody had something to say, except the
      youngest gentleman in company, who with a noble self-devotion did the
      heavy work, and held up Mr Pecksniff&rsquo;s head without being taken notice of
      by anybody. At last they gathered round, and agreed to carry him upstairs
      to bed. The youngest gentleman in company was rebuked by Jinkins for
      tearing Mr Pecksniff&rsquo;s coat! Ha, ha! But no matter.
    </p>
    <p>
      They carried him upstairs, and crushed the youngest gentleman at every
      step. His bedroom was at the top of the house, and it was a long way; but
      they got him there in course of time. He asked them frequently on the road
      for a little drop of something to drink. It seemed an idiosyncrasy. The
      youngest gentleman in company proposed a draught of water. Mr Pecksniff
      called him opprobious names for the suggestion.
    </p>
    <p>
      Jinkins and Gander took the rest upon themselves, and made him as
      comfortable as they could, on the outside of his bed; and when he seemed
      disposed to sleep, they left him. But before they had all gained the
      bottom of the staircase, a vision of Mr Pecksniff, strangely attired, was
      seen to flutter on the top landing. He desired to collect their
      sentiments, it seemed, upon the nature of human life.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;My friends,&rsquo; cried Mr Pecksniff, looking over the banisters, &lsquo;let us
      improve our minds by mutual inquiry and discussion. Let us be moral. Let
      us contemplate existence. Where is Jinkins?&rsquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Here,&rsquo; cried that gentleman. &lsquo;Go to bed again&rsquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;To bed!&rsquo; said Mr Pecksniff. &lsquo;Bed! &lsquo;Tis the voice of the sluggard, I hear
      him complain, you have woke me too soon, I must slumber again. If any
      young orphan will repeat the remainder of that simple piece from Doctor
      Watts&rsquo;s collection, an eligible opportunity now offers.&rsquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      Nobody volunteered.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;This is very soothing,&rsquo; said Mr Pecksniff, after a pause. &lsquo;Extremely so.
      Cool and refreshing; particularly to the legs! The legs of the human
      subject, my friends, are a beautiful production. Compare them with wooden
      legs, and observe the difference between the anatomy of nature and the
      anatomy of art. Do you know,&rsquo; said Mr Pecksniff, leaning over the
      banisters, with an odd recollection of his familiar manner among new
      pupils at home, &lsquo;that I should very much like to see Mrs Todgers&rsquo;s notion
      of a wooden leg, if perfectly agreeable to herself!&rsquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      As it appeared impossible to entertain any reasonable hopes of him after
      this speech, Mr Jinkins and Mr Gander went upstairs again, and once more
      got him into bed. But they had not descended to the second floor before he
      was out again; nor, when they had repeated the process, had they descended
      the first flight, before he was out again. In a word, as often as he was
      shut up in his own room, he darted out afresh, charged with some new moral
      sentiment, which he continually repeated over the banisters, with
      extraordinary relish, and an irrepressible desire for the improvement of
      his fellow creatures that nothing could subdue.
    </p>
    <p>
      Under these circumstances, when they had got him into bed for the
      thirtieth time or so, Mr Jinkins held him, while his companion went
      downstairs in search of Bailey junior, with whom he presently returned.
      That youth having been apprised of the service required of him, was in
      great spirits, and brought up a stool, a candle, and his supper; to the
      end that he might keep watch outside the bedroom door with tolerable
      comfort.
    </p>
    <p>
      When he had completed his arrangements, they locked Mr Pecksniff in, and
      left the key on the outside; charging the young page to listen attentively
      for symptoms of an apoplectic nature, with which the patient might be
      troubled, and, in case of any such presenting themselves, to summon them
      without delay. To which Mr Bailey modestly replied that &lsquo;he hoped he
      knowed wot o&rsquo;clock it wos in gineral, and didn&rsquo;t date his letters to his
      friends from Todgers&rsquo;s for nothing.&rsquo;

    <h2>
      CHAPTER TEN
    </h2>
    <p>
      CONTAINING STRANGE MATTER, ON WHICH MANY EVENTS IN THIS HISTORY MAY, FOR
      THEIR GOOD OR EVIL INFLUENCE, CHIEFLY DEPEND
    </p>
    <p>
      But Mr Pecksniff came to town on business. Had he forgotten that? Was he
      always taking his pleasure with Todgers&rsquo;s jovial brood, unmindful of the
      serious demands, whatever they might be, upon his calm consideration? No.
    </p>
    <p>
      Time and tide will wait for no man, saith the adage. But all men have to
      wait for time and tide. That tide which, taken at the flood, would lead
      Seth Pecksniff on to fortune, was marked down in the table, and about to
      flow. No idle Pecksniff lingered far inland, unmindful of the changes of
      the stream; but there, upon the water&rsquo;s edge, over his shoes already,
      stood the worthy creature, prepared to wallow in the very mud, so that it
      slid towards the quarter of his hope.
    </p>
    <p>
      The trustfulness of his two fair daughters was beautiful indeed. They had
      that firm reliance on their parent&rsquo;s nature, which taught them to feel
      certain that in all he did he had his purpose straight and full before
      him. And that its noble end and object was himself, which almost of
      necessity included them, they knew. The devotion of these maids was
      perfect.
    </p>
    <p>
      Their filial confidence was rendered the more touching, by their having no
      knowledge of their parent&rsquo;s real designs, in the present instance. All
      that they knew of his proceedings was, that every morning, after the early
      breakfast, he repaired to the post office and inquired for letters. That
      task performed, his business for the day was over; and he again relaxed,
      until the rising of another sun proclaimed the advent of another post.
    </p>
    <p>
      This went on for four or five days. At length, one morning, Mr Pecksniff
      returned with a breathless rapidity, strange to observe in him, at other
      times so calm; and, seeking immediate speech with his daughters, shut
      himself up with them in private conference for two whole hours. Of all
      that passed in this period, only the following words of Mr Pecksniff&rsquo;s
      utterance are known:
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;How he has come to change so very much (if it should turn out as I
      expect, that he has), we needn&rsquo;t stop to inquire. My dears, I have my
      thoughts upon the subject, but I will not impart them. It is enough that
      we will not be proud, resentful, or unforgiving. If he wants our
      friendship he shall have it. We know our duty, I hope!&rsquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      That same day at noon, an old gentleman alighted from a hackney-coach at
      the post-office, and, giving his name, inquired for a letter addressed to
      himself, and directed to be left till called for. It had been lying there
      some days. The superscription was in Mr Pecksniff&rsquo;s hand, and it was
      sealed with Mr Pecksniff&rsquo;s seal.
    </p>
    <p>
      It was very short, containing indeed nothing more than an address &lsquo;with Mr
      Pecksniff&rsquo;s respectful, and (not withstanding what has passed) sincerely
      affectionate regards.&rsquo; The old gentleman tore off the direction&mdash;scattering
      the rest in fragments to the winds&mdash;and giving it to the coachman,
      bade him drive as near that place as he could. In pursuance of these
      instructions he was driven to the Monument; where he again alighted, and
      dismissed the vehicle, and walked towards Todgers&rsquo;s.
    </p>
    <p>
      Though the face, and form, and gait of this old man, and even his grip of
      the stout stick on which he leaned, were all expressive of a resolution
      not easily shaken, and a purpose (it matters little whether right or
      wrong, just now) such as in other days might have survived the rack, and
      had its strongest life in weakest death; still there were grains of
      hesitation in his mind, which made him now avoid the house he sought, and
      loiter to and fro in a gleam of sunlight, that brightened the little
      churchyard hard by. There may have been, in the presence of those idle
      heaps of dust among the busiest stir of life, something to increase his
      wavering; but there he walked, awakening the echoes as he paced up and
      down, until the church clock, striking the quarters for the second time
      since he had been there, roused him from his meditation. Shaking off his
      incertitude as the air parted with the sound of the bells, he walked
      rapidly to the house, and knocked at the door.
    </p>
    <p>
      Mr Pecksniff was seated in the landlady&rsquo;s little room, and his visitor
      found him reading&mdash;by an accident; he apologised for it&mdash;an
      excellent theological work. There were cake and wine upon a little table&mdash;by
      another accident, for which he also apologised. Indeed he said, he had
      given his visitor up, and was about to partake of that simple refreshment
      with his children, when he knocked at the door.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Your daughters are well?&rsquo; said old Martin, laying down his hat and stick.
    </p>
    <p>
      Mr Pecksniff endeavoured to conceal his agitation as a father when he
      answered Yes, they were. They were good girls, he said, very good. He
      would not venture to recommend Mr Chuzzlewit to take the easy-chair, or to
      keep out of the draught from the door. If he made any such suggestion, he
      would expose himself, he feared, to most unjust suspicion. He would,
      therefore, content himself with remarking that there was an easy-chair in
      the room, and that the door was far from being air-tight. This latter
      imperfection, he might perhaps venture to add, was not uncommonly to be
      met with in old houses.
    </p>
    <p>
      The old man sat down in the easy-chair, and after a few moments&rsquo; silence,
      said:
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;In the first place, let me thank you for coming to London so promptly, at
      my almost unexplained request; I need scarcely add, at my cost.&rsquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;At <i>your </i>cost, my good sir!&rsquo; cried Mr Pecksniff, in a tone of great
      surprise.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;It is not,&rsquo; said Martin, waving his hand impatiently, &lsquo;my habit to put my&mdash;well!
      my relatives&mdash;to any personal expense to gratify my caprices.&rsquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Caprices, my good sir!&rsquo; cried Mr Pecksniff
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;That is scarcely the proper word either, in this instance,&rsquo; said the old
      man. &lsquo;No. You are right.&rsquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      Mr Pecksniff was inwardly very much relieved to hear it, though he didn&rsquo;t
      at all know why.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;You are right,&rsquo; repeated Martin. &lsquo;It is not a caprice. It is built up on
      reason, proof, and cool comparison. Caprices never are. Moreover, I am not
      a capricious man. I never was.&rsquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Most assuredly not,&rsquo; said Mr Pecksniff.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;How do you know?&rsquo; returned the other quickly. &lsquo;You are to begin to know
      it now. You are to test and prove it, in time to come. You and yours are
      to find that I can be constant, and am not to be diverted from my end. Do
      you hear?&rsquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Perfectly,&rsquo; said Mr Pecksniff.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;I very much regret,&rsquo; Martin resumed, looking steadily at him, and
      speaking in a slow and measured tone; &lsquo;I very much regret that you and I
      held such a conversation together, as that which passed between us at our
      last meeting. I very much regret that I laid open to you what were then my
      thoughts of you, so freely as I did. The intentions that I bear towards
      you now are of another kind; deserted by all in whom I have ever trusted;
      hoodwinked and beset by all who should help and sustain me; I fly to you
      for refuge. I confide in you to be my ally; to attach yourself to me by
      ties of Interest and Expectation&rsquo;&mdash;he laid great stress upon these
      words, though Mr Pecksniff particularly begged him not to mention it; &lsquo;and
      to help me to visit the consequences of the very worst species of
      meanness, dissimulation, and subtlety, on the right heads.&rsquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;My noble sir!&rsquo; cried Mr Pecksniff, catching at his outstretched hand.
      &lsquo;And <i>you </i>regret the having harboured unjust thoughts of me! <i>you </i>with those
      grey hairs!&rsquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Regrets,&rsquo; said Martin, &lsquo;are the natural property of grey hairs; and I
      enjoy, in common with all other men, at least my share of such
      inheritance. And so enough of that. I regret having been severed from you
      so long. If I had known you sooner, and sooner used you as you well
      deserve, I might have been a happier man.&rsquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      Mr Pecksniff looked up to the ceiling, and clasped his hands in rapture.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Your daughters,&rsquo; said Martin, after a short silence. &lsquo;I don&rsquo;t know them.
      Are they like you?&rsquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;In the nose of my eldest and the chin of my youngest, Mr Chuzzlewit,&rsquo;
      returned the widower, &lsquo;their sainted parent (not myself, their mother)
      lives again.&rsquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;I don&rsquo;t mean in person,&rsquo; said the old man. &lsquo;Morally, morally.&rsquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;&rsquo;Tis not for me to say,&rsquo; retorted Mr Pecksniff with a gentle smile. &lsquo;I
      have done my best, sir.&rsquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;I could wish to see them,&rsquo; said Martin; &lsquo;are they near at hand?&rsquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      They were, very near; for they had in fact been listening at the door from
      the beginning of this conversation until now, when they precipitately
      retired. Having wiped the signs of weakness from his eyes, and so given
      them time to get upstairs, Mr Pecksniff opened the door, and mildly cried
      in the passage,
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;My own darlings, where are you?&rsquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Here, my dear pa!&rsquo; replied the distant voice of Charity.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Come down into the back parlour, if you please, my love,&rsquo; said Mr
      Pecksniff, &lsquo;and bring your sister with you.&rsquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Yes, my dear pa,&rsquo; cried Merry; and down they came directly (being all
      obedience), singing as they came.
    </p>
    <p>
      Nothing could exceed the astonishment of the two Miss Pecksniffs when they
      found a stranger with their dear papa. Nothing could surpass their mute
      amazement when he said, &lsquo;My children, Mr Chuzzlewit!&rsquo; But when he told
      them that Mr Chuzzlewit and he were friends, and that Mr Chuzzlewit had
      said such kind and tender words as pierced his very heart, the two Miss
      Pecksniffs cried with one accord, &lsquo;Thank Heaven for this!&rsquo; and fell upon
      the old man&rsquo;s neck. And when they had embraced him with such fervour of
      affection that no words can describe it, they grouped themselves about his
      chair, and hung over him, as figuring to themselves no earthly joy like
      that of ministering to his wants, and crowding into the remainder of his
      life, the love they would have diffused over their whole existence, from
      infancy, if he&mdash;dear obdurate!&mdash;had but consented to receive the
      precious offering.

    <p>
      The old man looked attentively from one to the other, and then at Mr
      Pecksniff, several times.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;What,&rsquo; he asked of Mr Pecksniff, happening to catch his eye in its
      descent; for until now it had been piously upraised, with something of
      that expression which the poetry of ages has attributed to a domestic
      bird, when breathing its last amid the ravages of an electric storm: &lsquo;What
      are their names?&rsquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      Mr Pecksniff told him, and added, rather hastily; his caluminators would
      have said, with a view to any testamentary thoughts that might be flitting
      through old Martin&rsquo;s mind; &lsquo;Perhaps, my dears, you had better write them
      down. Your humble autographs are of no value in themselves, but affection
      may prize them.&rsquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Affection,&rsquo; said the old man, &lsquo;will expend itself on the living
      originals. Do not trouble yourselves, my girls, I shall not so easily
      forget you, Charity and Mercy, as to need such tokens of remembrance.
      Cousin!&rsquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Sir!&rsquo; said Mr Pecksniff, with alacrity.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Do you never sit down?&rsquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Why&mdash;yes&mdash;occasionally, sir,&rsquo; said Mr Pecksniff, who had been
      standing all this time.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Will you do so now?&rsquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Can you ask me,&rsquo; returned Mr Pecksniff, slipping into a chair
      immediately, &lsquo;whether I will do anything that you desire?&rsquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;You talk confidently,&rsquo; said Martin, &lsquo;and you mean well; but I fear you
      don&rsquo;t know what an old man&rsquo;s humours are. You don&rsquo;t know what it is to be
      required to court his likings and dislikings; to adapt yourself to his
      prejudices; to do his bidding, be it what it may; to bear with his
      distrusts and jealousies; and always still be zealous in his service. When
      I remember how numerous these failings are in me, and judge of their
      occasional enormity by the injurious thoughts I lately entertained of you,
      I hardly dare to claim you for my friend.&rsquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;My worthy sir,&rsquo; returned his relative, &lsquo;how <i>can </i>you talk in such a
      painful strain! What was more natural than that you should make one slight
      mistake, when in all other respects you were so very correct, and have had
      such reason&mdash;such very sad and undeniable reason&mdash;to judge of
      every one about you in the worst light!&rsquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;True,&rsquo; replied the other. &lsquo;You are very lenient with me.&rsquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;We always said, my girls and I,&rsquo; cried Mr Pecksniff with increasing
      obsequiousness, &lsquo;that while we mourned the heaviness of our misfortune in
      being confounded with the base and mercenary, still we could not wonder at
      it. My dears, you remember?&rsquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      Oh vividly! A thousand times!
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;We uttered no complaint,&rsquo; said Mr Pecksniff. &lsquo;Occasionally we had the
      presumption to console ourselves with the remark that Truth would in the
      end prevail, and Virtue be triumphant; but not often. My loves, you
      recollect?&rsquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      Recollect! Could he doubt it! Dearest pa, what strange unnecessary
      questions!
    </p>
<div class="fig" style="width:65%">

    </div>
    <h5>
      <a href="images/0075.jpg"><i>Original</i></a>
    </h5>
    <p>
      &lsquo;And when I saw you,&rsquo; resumed Mr Pecksniff, with still greater deference,
      &lsquo;in the little, unassuming village where we take the liberty of dwelling,
      I said you were mistaken in me, my dear sir; that was all, I think?&rsquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;No&mdash;not all,&rsquo; said Martin, who had been sitting with his hand upon
      his brow for some time past, and now looked up again; &lsquo;you said much more,
      which, added to other circumstances that have come to my knowledge, opened
      my eyes. You spoke to me, disinterestedly, on behalf of&mdash;I needn&rsquo;t
      name him. You know whom I mean.&rsquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      Trouble was expressed in Mr Pecksniff&rsquo;s visage, as he pressed his hot
      hands together, and replied, with humility, &lsquo;Quite disinterestedly, sir, I
      assure you.&rsquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;I know it,&rsquo; said old Martin, in his quiet way. &lsquo;I am sure of it. I said
      so. It was disinterested too, in you, to draw that herd of harpies off
      from me, and be their victim yourself; most other men would have suffered
      them to display themselves in all their rapacity, and would have striven
      to rise, by contrast, in my estimation. You felt for me, and drew them
      off, for which I owe you many thanks. Although I left the place, I know
      what passed behind my back, you see!&rsquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;You amaze me, sir!&rsquo; cried Mr Pecksniff; which was true enough.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;My knowledge of your proceedings,&rsquo; said the old man, does not stop at
      this. You have a new inmate in your house.&rsquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Yes, sir,&rsquo; rejoined the architect, &lsquo;I have.&rsquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;He must quit it&rsquo; said Martin.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;For&mdash;for yours?&rsquo; asked Mr Pecksniff, with a quavering mildness.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;For any shelter he can find,&rsquo; the old man answered. &lsquo;He has deceived
      you.&rsquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;I hope not&rsquo; said Mr Pecksniff, eagerly. &lsquo;I trust not. I have been
      extremely well disposed towards that young man. I hope it cannot be shown
      that he has forfeited all claim to my protection. Deceit&mdash;deceit, my
      dear Mr Chuzzlewit, would be final. I should hold myself bound, on proof
      of deceit, to renounce him instantly.&rsquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      The old man glanced at both his fair supporters, but especially at Miss
      Mercy, whom, indeed, he looked full in the face, with a greater
      demonstration of interest than had yet appeared in his features. His gaze
      again encountered Mr Pecksniff, as he said, composedly:
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Of course you know that he has made his matrimonial choice?&rsquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Oh dear!&rsquo; cried Mr Pecksniff, rubbing his hair up very stiff upon his
      head, and staring wildly at his daughters. &lsquo;This is becoming tremendous!&rsquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;You know the fact?&rsquo; repeated Martin
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Surely not without his grandfather&rsquo;s consent and approbation my dear
      sir!&rsquo; cried Mr Pecksniff. &lsquo;Don&rsquo;t tell me that. For the honour of human
      nature, say you&rsquo;re not about to tell me that!&rsquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;I thought he had suppressed it,&rsquo; said the old man.
    </p>
    <p>
      The indignation felt by Mr Pecksniff at this terrible disclosure, was only
      to be equalled by the kindling anger of his daughters. What! Had they
      taken to their hearth and home a secretly contracted serpent; a crocodile,
      who had made a furtive offer of his hand; an imposition on society; a
      bankrupt bachelor with no effects, trading with the spinster world on
      false pretences! And oh, to think that he should have disobeyed and
      practised on that sweet, that venerable gentleman, whose name he bore;
      that kind and tender guardian; his more than father&mdash;to say nothing
      at all of mother&mdash;horrible, horrible! To turn him out with ignominy
      would be treatment much too good. Was there nothing else that could be
      done to him? Had he incurred no legal pains and penalties? Could it be
      that the statutes of the land were so remiss as to have affixed no
      punishment to such delinquency? Monster; how basely had they been
      deceived!
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;I am glad to find you second me so warmly,&rsquo; said the old man holding up
      his hand to stay the torrent of their wrath. &lsquo;I will not deny that it is a
      pleasure to me to find you so full of zeal. We will consider that topic as
      disposed of.&rsquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;No, my dear sir,&rsquo; cried Mr Pecksniff, &lsquo;not as disposed of, until I have
      purged my house of this pollution.&rsquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;That will follow,&rsquo; said the old man, &lsquo;in its own time. I look upon that
      as done.&rsquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;You are very good, sir,&rsquo; answered Mr Pecksniff, shaking his hand. &lsquo;You do
      me honour. You <i>may </i>look upon it as done, I assure you.&rsquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;There is another topic,&rsquo; said Martin, &lsquo;on which I hope you will assist
      me. You remember Mary, cousin?&rsquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;The young lady that I mentioned to you, my dears, as having interested me
      so very much,&rsquo; remarked Mr Pecksniff. &lsquo;Excuse my interrupting you, sir.&rsquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;I told you her history?&rsquo; said the old man.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Which I also mentioned, you will recollect, my dears,&rsquo; cried Mr
      Pecksniff. &lsquo;Silly girls, Mr Chuzzlewit&mdash;quite moved by it, they
      were!&rsquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Why, look now!&rsquo; said Martin, evidently pleased; &lsquo;I feared I should have
      had to urge her case upon you, and ask you to regard her favourably for my
      sake. But I find you have no jealousies! Well! You have no cause for any,
      to be sure. She has nothing to gain from me, my dears, and she knows it.&rsquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      The two Miss Pecksniffs murmured their approval of this wise arrangement,
      and their cordial sympathy with its interesting object.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;If I could have anticipated what has come to pass between us four,&rsquo; said
      the old man thoughfully; &lsquo;but it is too late to think of that. You would
      receive her courteously, young ladies, and be kind to her, if need were?&rsquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      Where was the orphan whom the two Miss Pecksniffs would not have cherished
      in their sisterly bosom! But when that orphan was commended to their care
      by one on whom the dammed-up love of years was gushing forth, what
      exhaustless stores of pure affection yearned to expend themselves upon
      her!
    </p>
    <p>
      An interval ensued, during which Mr Chuzzlewit, in an absent frame of
      mind, sat gazing at the ground, without uttering a word; and as it was
      plain that he had no desire to be interrupted in his meditations, Mr
      Pecksniff and his daughters were profoundly silent also. During the whole
      of the foregoing dialogue, he had borne his part with a cold, passionless
      promptitude, as though he had learned and painfully rehearsed it all a
      hundred times. Even when his expressions were warmest and his language
      most encouraging, he had retained the same manner, without the least
      abatement. But now there was a keener brightness in his eye, and more
      expression in his voice, as he said, awakening from his thoughtful mood:
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;You know what will be said of this? Have you reflected?&rsquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Said of what, my dear sir?&rsquo; Mr Pecksniff asked.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Of this new understanding between us.&rsquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      Mr Pecksniff looked benevolently sagacious, and at the same time far above
      all earthly misconstruction, as he shook his head, and observed that a
      great many things would be said of it, no doubt.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;A great many,&rsquo; rejoined the old man. &lsquo;Some will say that I dote in my old
      age; that illness has shaken me; that I have lost all strength of mind,
      and have grown childish. You can bear that?&rsquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      Mr Pecksniff answered that it would be dreadfully hard to bear, but he
      thought he could, if he made a great effort.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Others will say&mdash;I speak of disappointed, angry people only&mdash;that
      you have lied and fawned, and wormed yourself through dirty ways into my
      favour; by such concessions and such crooked deeds, such meannesses and
      vile endurances, as nothing could repay; no, not the legacy of half the
      world we live in. You can bear that?&rsquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      Mr Pecksniff made reply that this would be also very hard to bear, as
      reflecting, in some degree, on the discernment of Mr Chuzzlewit. Still he
      had a modest confidence that he could sustain the calumny, with the help
      of a good conscience, and that gentleman&rsquo;s friendship.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;With the great mass of slanderers,&rsquo; said old Martin, leaning back in his
      chair, &lsquo;the tale, as I clearly foresee, will run thus: That to mark my
      contempt for the rabble whom I despised, I chose from among them the very
      worst, and made him do my will, and pampered and enriched him at the cost
      of all the rest. That, after casting about for the means of a punishment
      which should rankle in the bosoms of these kites the most, and strike into
      their gall, I devised this scheme at a time when the last link in the
      chain of grateful love and duty, that held me to my race, was roughly
      snapped asunder; roughly, for I loved him well; roughly, for I had ever
      put my trust in his affection; roughly, for that he broke it when I loved
      him most&mdash;God help me!&mdash;and he without a pang could throw me
      off, while I clung about his heart! Now,&rsquo; said the old man, dismissing
      this passionate outburst as suddenly as he had yielded to it, &lsquo;is your
      mind made up to bear this likewise? Lay your account with having it to
      bear, and put no trust in being set right by me.&rsquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;My dear Mr Chuzzlewit,&rsquo; cried Pecksniff in an ecstasy, &lsquo;for such a man as
      you have shown yourself to be this day; for a man so injured, yet so very
      humane; for a man so&mdash;I am at a loss what precise term to use&mdash;yet
      at the same time so remarkably&mdash;I don&rsquo;t know how to express my
      meaning; for such a man as I have described, I hope it is no presumption
      to say that I, and I am sure I may add my children also (my dears, we
      perfectly agree in this, I think?), would bear anything whatever!&rsquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Enough,&rsquo; said Martin. &lsquo;You can charge no consequences on me. When do you
      retire home?&rsquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Whenever you please, my dear sir. To-night if you desire it.&rsquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;I desire nothing,&rsquo; returned the old man, &lsquo;that is unreasonable. Such a
      request would be. Will you be ready to return at the end of this week?&rsquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      The very time of all others that Mr Pecksniff would have suggested if it
      had been left to him to make his own choice. As to his daughters&mdash;the
      words, &lsquo;Let us be at home on Saturday, dear pa,&rsquo; were actually upon their
      lips.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Your expenses, cousin,&rsquo; said Martin, taking a folded slip of paper from
      his pocketbook, &lsquo;may possibly exceed that amount. If so, let me know the
      balance that I owe you, when we next meet. It would be useless if I told
      you where I live just now; indeed, I have no fixed abode. When I have, you
      shall know it. You and your daughters may expect to see me before long; in
      the meantime I need not tell you that we keep our own confidence. What you
      will do when you get home is understood between us. Give me no account of
      it at any time; and never refer to it in any way. I ask that as a favour.
      I am commonly a man of few words, cousin; and all that need be said just
      now is said, I think.&rsquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;One glass of wine&mdash;one morsel of this homely cake?&rsquo; cried Mr
      Pecksniff, venturing to detain him. &lsquo;My dears&mdash;!&rsquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      The sisters flew to wait upon him.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Poor girls!&rsquo; said Mr Pecksniff. &lsquo;You will excuse their agitation, my dear
      sir. They are made up of feeling. A bad commodity to go through the world
      with, Mr Chuzzlewit! My youngest daughter is almost as much of a woman as
      my eldest, is she not, sir?&rsquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Which <i>is</i> the youngest?&rsquo; asked the old man.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Mercy, by five years,&rsquo; said Mr Pecksniff. &lsquo;We sometimes venture to
      consider her rather a fine figure, sir. Speaking as an artist, I may
      perhaps be permitted to suggest that its outline is graceful and correct.
      I am naturally,&rsquo; said Mr Pecksniff, drying his hands upon his
      handkerchief, and looking anxiously in his cousin&rsquo;s face at almost every
      word, &lsquo;proud, if I may use the expression, to have a daughter who is
      constructed on the best models.&rsquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;She seems to have a lively disposition,&rsquo; observed Martin.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Dear me!&rsquo; said Mr Pecksniff. &lsquo;That is quite remarkable. You have defined
      her character, my dear sir, as correctly as if you had known her from her
      birth. She <i>has </i>a lively disposition. I assure you, my dear sir, that in
      our unpretending home her gaiety is delightful.&rsquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;No doubt,&rsquo; returned the old man.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Charity, upon the other hand,&rsquo; said Mr Pecksniff, &lsquo;is remarkable for
      strong sense, and for rather a deep tone of sentiment, if the partiality
      of a father may be excused in saying so. A wonderful affection between
      them, my dear sir! Allow me to drink your health. Bless you!&rsquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;I little thought,&rsquo; retorted Martin, &lsquo;but a month ago, that I should be
      breaking bread and pouring wine with you. I drink to you.&rsquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      Not at all abashed by the extraordinary abruptness with which these latter
      words were spoken, Mr Pecksniff thanked him devoutly.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Now let me go,&rsquo; said Martin, putting down the wine when he had merely
      touched it with his lips. &lsquo;My dears, good morning!&rsquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      But this distant form of farewell was by no means tender enough for the
      yearnings of the young ladies, who again embraced him with all their
      hearts&mdash;with all their arms at any rate&mdash;to which parting
      caresses their new-found friend submitted with a better grace than might
      have been expected from one who, not a moment before, had pledged their
      parent in such a very uncomfortable manner. These endearments terminated,
      he took a hasty leave of Mr Pecksniff and withdrew, followed to the door
      by both father and daughters, who stood there kissing their hands and
      beaming with affection until he disappeared; though, by the way, he never
      once looked back, after he had crossed the threshold.
    </p>
    <p>
      When they returned into the house, and were again alone in Mrs Todgers&rsquo;s
      room, the two young ladies exhibited an unusual amount of gaiety; insomuch
      that they clapped their hands, and laughed, and looked with roguish
      aspects and a bantering air upon their dear papa. This conduct was so very
      unaccountable, that Mr Pecksniff (being singularly grave himself) could
      scarcely choose but ask them what it meant; and took them to task, in his
      gentle manner, for yielding to such light emotions.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;If it was possible to divine any cause for this merriment, even the most
      remote,&rsquo; he said, &lsquo;I should not reprove you. But when you can have none
      whatever&mdash;oh, really, really!&rsquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      This admonition had so little effect on Mercy, that she was obliged to
      hold her handkerchief before her rosy lips, and to throw herself back in
      her chair, with every demonstration of extreme amusement; which want of
      duty so offended Mr Pecksniff that he reproved her in set terms, and gave
      her his parental advice to correct herself in solitude and contemplation.
      But at that juncture they were disturbed by the sound of voices in
      dispute; and as it proceeded from the next room, the subject matter of the
      altercation quickly reached their ears.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;I don&rsquo;t care that! Mrs Todgers,&rsquo; said the young gentleman who had been
      the youngest gentleman in company on the day of the festival; &lsquo;I don&rsquo;t
      care <i>that</i>, ma&rsquo;am,&rsquo; said he, snapping his fingers, &lsquo;for Jinkins. Don&rsquo;t
      suppose I do.&rsquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;I am quite certain you don&rsquo;t, sir,&rsquo; replied Mrs Todgers. &lsquo;You have too
      independent a spirit, I know, to yield to anybody. And quite right. There
      is no reason why you should give way to any gentleman. Everybody must be
      well aware of that.&rsquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;I should think no more of admitting daylight into the fellow,&rsquo; said the
      youngest gentleman, in a desperate voice, &lsquo;than if he was a bulldog.&rsquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      Mrs Todgers did not stop to inquire whether, as a matter of principle,
      there was any particular reason for admitting daylight even into a
      bulldog, otherwise than by the natural channel of his eyes, but she seemed
      to wring her hands, and she moaned.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Let him be careful,&rsquo; said the youngest gentleman. &lsquo;I give him warning. No
      man shall step between me and the current of my vengeance. I know a Cove&mdash;&rsquo;
      he used that familiar epithet in his agitation but corrected himself by
      adding, &lsquo;a gentleman of property, I mean&mdash;who practices with a pair
      of pistols (fellows too) of his own. If I am driven to borrow &lsquo;em, and to
      send at friend to Jinkins, a tragedy will get into the papers. That&rsquo;s
      all.&rsquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      Again Mrs Todgers moaned.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;I have borne this long enough,&rsquo; said the youngest gentleman but now my
      soul rebels against it, and I won&rsquo;t stand it any longer. I left home
      originally, because I had that within me which wouldn&rsquo;t be domineered over
      by a sister; and do you think I&rsquo;m going to be put down by <i>him</i>? No.&rsquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;It is very wrong in Mr Jinkins; I know it is perfectly inexcusable in Mr
      Jinkins, if he intends it,&rsquo; observed Mrs Todgers
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;If he intends it!&rsquo; cried the youngest gentleman. &lsquo;Don&rsquo;t he interrupt and
      contradict me on every occasion? Does he ever fail to interpose himself
      between me and anything or anybody that he sees I have set my mind upon?
      Does he make a point of always pretending to forget me, when he&rsquo;s pouring
      out the beer? Does he make bragging remarks about his razors, and
      insulting allusions to people who have no necessity to shave more than
      once a week? But let him look out! He&rsquo;ll find himself shaved, pretty
      close, before long, and so I tell him.&rsquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      The young gentleman was mistaken in this closing sentence, inasmuch as he
      never told it to Jinkins, but always to Mrs Todgers.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;However,&rsquo; he said, &lsquo;these are not proper subjects for ladies&rsquo; ears. All
      I&rsquo;ve got to say to you, Mrs Todgers, is, a week&rsquo;s notice from next
      Saturday. The same house can&rsquo;t contain that miscreant and me any longer.
      If we get over the intermediate time without bloodshed, you may think
      yourself pretty fortunate. I don&rsquo;t myself expect we shall.&rsquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Dear, dear!&rsquo; cried Mrs Todgers, &lsquo;what would I have given to have
      prevented this? To lose you, sir, would be like losing the house&rsquo;s
      right-hand. So popular as you are among the gentlemen; so generally looked
      up to; and so much liked! I do hope you&rsquo;ll think better of it; if on
      nobody else&rsquo;s account, on mine.&rsquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;There&rsquo;s Jinkins,&rsquo; said the youngest gentleman, moodily. &lsquo;Your favourite.
      He&rsquo;ll console you, and the gentlemen too, for the loss of twenty such as
      me. I&rsquo;m not understood in this house. I never have been.&rsquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Don&rsquo;t run away with that opinion, sir!&rsquo; cried Mrs Todgers, with a show of
      honest indignation. &lsquo;Don&rsquo;t make such a charge as that against the
      establishment, I must beg of you. It is not so bad as that comes to, sir.
      Make any remark you please against the gentlemen, or against me; but don&rsquo;t
      say you&rsquo;re not understood in this house.&rsquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;I&rsquo;m not treated as if I was,&rsquo; said the youngest gentleman.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;There you make a great mistake, sir,&rsquo; returned Mrs Todgers, in the same
      strain. &lsquo;As many of the gentlemen and I have often said, you are too
      sensitive. That&rsquo;s where it is. You are of too susceptible a nature; it&rsquo;s
      in your spirit.&rsquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      The young gentleman coughed.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;And as,&rsquo; said Mrs Todgers, &lsquo;as to Mr Jinkins, I must beg of you, if we
      <i>are </i>to part, to understand that I don&rsquo;t abet Mr Jinkins by any means. Far
      from it. I could wish that Mr Jinkins would take a lower tone in this
      establishment, and would not be the means of raising differences between
      me and gentlemen that I can much less bear to part with than I could with
      Mr Jinkins. Mr Jinkins is not such a boarder, sir,&rsquo; added Mrs Todgers,
      &lsquo;that all considerations of private feeling and respect give way before
      him. Quite the contrary, I assure you.&rsquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      The young gentleman was so much mollified by these and similar speeches on
      the part of Mrs Todgers, that he and that lady gradually changed
      positions; so that she became the injured party, and he was understood to
      be the injurer; but in a complimentary, not in an offensive sense; his
      cruel conduct being attributable to his exalted nature, and to that alone.
      So, in the end, the young gentleman withdrew his notice, and assured Mrs
      Todgers of his unalterable regard; and having done so, went back to
      business.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Goodness me, Miss Pecksniffs!&rsquo; cried that lady, as she came into the back
      room, and sat wearily down, with her basket on her knees, and her hands
      folded upon it, &lsquo;what a trial of temper it is to keep a house like this!
      You must have heard most of what has just passed. Now did you ever hear
      the like?&rsquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Never!&rsquo; said the two Miss Pecksniffs.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Of all the ridiculous young fellows that ever I had to deal with,&rsquo;
      resumed Mrs Todgers, &lsquo;that is the most ridiculous and unreasonable. Mr
      Jinkins is hard upon him sometimes, but not half as hard as he deserves.
      To mention such a gentleman as Mr Jinkins in the same breath with <i>him</i>&mdash;you
      know it&rsquo;s too much! And yet he&rsquo;s as jealous of him, bless you, as if he
      was his equal.&rsquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      The young ladies were greatly entertained by Mrs Todgers&rsquo;s account, no
      less than with certain anecdotes illustrative of the youngest gentleman&rsquo;s
      character, which she went on to tell them. But Mr Pecksniff looked quite
      stern and angry; and when she had concluded, said in a solemn voice:
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Pray, Mrs Todgers, if I may inquire, what does that young gentleman
      contribute towards the support of these premises?&rsquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Why, sir, for what <i>he</i> has, he pays about eighteen shillings a week!&rsquo; said
      Mrs Todgers.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Eighteen shillings a week!&rsquo; repeated Mr Pecksniff.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Taking one week with another; as near that as possible,&rsquo; said Mrs
      Todgers.
    </p>
    <p>
      Mr Pecksniff rose from his chair, folded his arms, looked at her, and
      shook his head.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;And do you mean to say, ma&rsquo;am&mdash;is it possible, Mrs Todgers&mdash;that
      for such a miserable consideration as eighteen shillings a week, a female
      of your understanding can so far demean herself as to wear a double face,
      even for an instant?&rsquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;I am forced to keep things on the square if I can, sir,&rsquo; faltered Mrs
      Todgers. &lsquo;I must preserve peace among them, and keep my connection
      together, if possible, Mr Pecksniff. The profit is very small.&rsquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;The profit!&rsquo; cried that gentleman, laying great stress upon the word.
      &lsquo;The profit, Mrs Todgers! You amaze me!&rsquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      He was so severe, that Mrs Todgers shed tears.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;The profit!&rsquo; repeated Mr pecksniff. &lsquo;The profit of dissimulation! To
      worship the golden calf of Baal, for eighteen shillings a week!&rsquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Don&rsquo;t in your own goodness be too hard upon me, Mr Pecksniff,&rsquo; cried Mrs
      Todgers, taking out her handkerchief.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Oh Calf, Calf!&rsquo; cried Mr Pecksniff mournfully. &lsquo;Oh, Baal, Baal! oh my
      friend, Mrs Todgers! To barter away that precious jewel, self-esteem, and
      cringe to any mortal creature&mdash;for eighteen shillings a week!&rsquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      He was so subdued and overcome by the reflection, that he immediately took
      down his hat from its peg in the passage, and went out for a walk, to
      compose his feelings. Anybody passing him in the street might have known
      him for a good man at first sight; for his whole figure teemed with a
      consciousness of the moral homily he had read to Mrs Todgers.
    </p>
    <p>
      Eighteen shillings a week! Just, most just, thy censure, upright
      Pecksniff! Had it been for the sake of a ribbon, star, or garter; sleeves
      of lawn, a great man&rsquo;s smile, a seat in parliament, a tap upon the
      shoulder from a courtly sword; a place, a party, or a thriving lie, or
      eighteen thousand pounds, or even eighteen hundred;&mdash;but to worship
      the golden calf for eighteen shillings a week! oh pitiful, pitiful!

      CHAPTER ELEVEN
    </h2>
    <p>
      WHEREIN A CERTAIN GENTLEMAN BECOMES PARTICULAR IN HIS ATTENTIONS TO A
      CERTAIN LADY; AND MORE COMING EVENTS THAN ONE, CAST THEIR SHADOWS BEFORE
    </p>
    <p>
      The family were within two or three days of their departure from Mrs
      Todgers&rsquo;s, and the commercial gentlemen were to a man despondent and not
      to be comforted, because of the approaching separation, when Bailey
      junior, at the jocund time of noon, presented himself before Miss Charity
      Pecksniff, then sitting with her sister in the banquet chamber, hemming
      six new pocket-handkerchiefs for Mr Jinkins; and having expressed a hope,
      preliminary and pious, that he might be blest, gave her in his pleasant
      way to understand that a visitor attended to pay his respects to her, and
      was at that moment waiting in the drawing-room. Perhaps this last
      announcement showed in a more striking point of view than many lengthened
      speeches could have done, the trustfulness and faith of Bailey&rsquo;s nature;
      since he had, in fact, last seen the visitor on the door-mat, where, after
      signifying to him that he would do well to go upstairs, he had left him to
      the guidance of his own sagacity. Hence it was at least an even chance
      that the visitor was then wandering on the roof of the house, or vainly
      seeking to extricate himself from the maze of bedrooms; Todgers&rsquo;s being
      precisely that kind of establishment in which an unpiloted stranger is
      pretty sure to find himself in some place where he least expects and least
      desires to be.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;A gentleman for me!&rsquo; cried Charity, pausing in her work; &lsquo;my gracious,
      Bailey!&rsquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Ah!&rsquo; said Bailey. &lsquo;It <i>is</i> my gracious, an&rsquo;t it? Wouldn&rsquo;t I be gracious
      neither, not if I wos him!&rsquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      The remark was rendered somewhat obscure in itself, by reason (as the
      reader may have observed) of a redundancy of negatives; but accompanied by
      action expressive of a faithful couple walking arm-in-arm towards a
      parochial church, mutually exchanging looks of love, it clearly signified
      this youth&rsquo;s conviction that the caller&rsquo;s purpose was of an amorous
      tendency. Miss Charity affected to reprove so great a liberty; but she
      could not help smiling. He was a strange boy, to be sure. There was always
      some ground of probability and likelihood mingled with his absurd
      behaviour. That was the best of it!
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;But I don&rsquo;t know any gentlemen, Bailey,&rsquo; said Miss Pecksniff. &lsquo;I think
      you must have made a mistake.&rsquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      Mr Bailey smiled at the extreme wildness of such a supposition, and
      regarded the young ladies with unimpaired affability.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;My dear Merry,&rsquo; said Charity, &lsquo;who <i>can </i>it be? Isn&rsquo;t it odd? I have a
      great mind not to go to him really. So very strange, you know!&rsquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      The younger sister plainly considered that this appeal had its origin in
      the pride of being called upon and asked for; and that it was intended as
      an assertion of superiority, and a retaliation upon her for having
      captured the commercial gentlemen. Therefore, she replied, with great
      affection and politeness, that it was, no doubt, very strange indeed; and
      that she was totally at a loss to conceive what the ridiculous person
      unknown could mean by it.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Quite impossible to divine!&rsquo; said Charity, with some sharpness, &lsquo;though
      still, at the same time, you needn&rsquo;t be angry, my dear.&rsquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Thank you,&rsquo; retorted Merry, singing at her needle. &lsquo;I am quite aware of
      that, my love.&rsquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;I am afraid your head is turned, you silly thing,&rsquo; said Cherry.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Do you know, my dear,&rsquo; said Merry, with engaging candour, &lsquo;that I have
      been afraid of that, myself, all along! So much incense and nonsense, and
      all the rest of it, is enough to turn a stronger head than mine. What a
      relief it must be to you, my dear, to be so very comfortable in that
      respect, and not to be worried by those odious men! How do you do it,
      Cherry?&rsquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      This artless inquiry might have led to turbulent results, but for the
      strong emotions of delight evinced by Bailey junior, whose relish in the
      turn the conversation had lately taken was so acute, that it impelled and
      forced him to the instantaneous performance of a dancing step, extremely
      difficult in its nature, and only to be achieved in a moment of ecstasy,
      which is commonly called The Frog&rsquo;s Hornpipe. A manifestation so lively,
      brought to their immediate recollection the great virtuous precept, &lsquo;Keep
      up appearances whatever you do,&rsquo; in which they had been educated. They
      forbore at once, and jointly signified to Mr Bailey that if he should
      presume to practice that figure any more in their presence, they would
      instantly acquaint Mrs Todgers with the fact, and would demand his condign
      punishment, at the hands of that lady. The young gentleman having
      expressed the bitterness of his contrition by affecting to wipe away
      scalding tears with his apron, and afterwards feigning to wring a vast
      amount of water from that garment, held the door open while Miss Charity
      passed out; and so that damsel went in state upstairs to receive her
      mysterious adorer.
    </p>
    <p>
      By some strange occurrence of favourable circumstances he had found out
      the drawing-room, and was sitting there alone.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Ah, cousin!&rsquo; he said. &lsquo;Here I am, you see. You thought I was lost, I&rsquo;ll
      be bound. Well! how do you find yourself by this time?&rsquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      Miss Charity replied that she was quite well, and gave Mr Jonas Chuzzlewit
      her hand.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;That&rsquo;s right,&rsquo; said Mr Jonas, &lsquo;and you&rsquo;ve got over the fatigues of the
      journey have you? I say. How&rsquo;s the other one?&rsquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;My sister is very well, I believe,&rsquo; returned the young lady. &lsquo;I have not
      heard her complain of any indisposition, sir. Perhaps you would like to
      see her, and ask her yourself?&rsquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;No, no cousin!&rsquo; said Mr Jonas, sitting down beside her on the
      window-seat. &lsquo;Don&rsquo;t be in a hurry. There&rsquo;s no occasion for that, you know.
      What a cruel girl you are!&rsquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;It&rsquo;s impossible for <i>you </i>to know,&rsquo; said Cherry, &lsquo;whether I am or not.&rsquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Well, perhaps it is,&rsquo; said Mr Jonas. &lsquo;I say&mdash;Did you think I was
      lost? You haven&rsquo;t told me that.&rsquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;I didn&rsquo;t think at all about it,&rsquo; answered Cherry.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Didn&rsquo;t you though?&rsquo; said Jonas, pondering upon this strange reply. &lsquo;Did
      the other one?&rsquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;I am sure it&rsquo;s impossible for me to say what my sister may, or may not
      have thought on such a subject,&rsquo; cried Cherry. &lsquo;She never said anything to
      me about it, one way or other.&rsquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Didn&rsquo;t she laugh about it?&rsquo; inquired Jonas.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;No. She didn&rsquo;t even laugh about it,&rsquo; answered Charity.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;She&rsquo;s a terrible one to laugh, an&rsquo;t she?&rsquo; said Jonas, lowering his voice.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;She is very lively,&rsquo; said Cherry.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Liveliness is a pleasant thing&mdash;when it don&rsquo;t lead to spending
      money. An&rsquo;t it?&rsquo; asked Mr Jonas.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Very much so, indeed,&rsquo; said Cherry, with a demureness of manner that gave
      a very disinterested character to her assent.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Such liveliness as yours I mean, you know,&rsquo; observed Mr Jonas, as he
      nudged her with his elbow. &lsquo;I should have come to see you before, but I
      didn&rsquo;t know where you was. How quick you hurried off, that morning!&rsquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;I was amenable to my papa&rsquo;s directions,&rsquo; said Miss Charity.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;I wish he had given me his direction,&rsquo; returned her cousin, &lsquo;and then I
      should have found you out before. Why, I shouldn&rsquo;t have found you even
      now, if I hadn&rsquo;t met him in the street this morning. What a sleek, sly
      chap he is! Just like a tomcat, an&rsquo;t he?&rsquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;I must trouble you to have the goodness to speak more respectfully of my
      papa, Mr Jonas,&rsquo; said Charity. &lsquo;I can&rsquo;t allow such a tone as that, even in
      jest.&rsquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Ecod, you may say what you like of <i>my</i> father, then, and so I give you
      leave,&rsquo; said Jonas. &lsquo;I think it&rsquo;s liquid aggravation that circulates
      through his veins, and not regular blood. How old should you think my
      father was, cousin?&rsquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Old, no doubt,&rsquo; replied Miss Charity; &lsquo;but a fine old gentleman.&rsquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;A fine old gentleman!&rsquo; repeated Jonas, giving the crown of his hat an
      angry knock. &lsquo;Ah! It&rsquo;s time he was thinking of being drawn out a little
      finer too. Why, he&rsquo;s eighty!&rsquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Is he, indeed?&rsquo; said the young lady.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;And ecod,&rsquo; cried Jonas, &lsquo;now he&rsquo;s gone so far without giving in, I don&rsquo;t
      see much to prevent his being ninety; no, nor even a hundred. Why, a man
      with any feeling ought to be ashamed of being eighty, let alone more.
      Where&rsquo;s his religion, I should like to know, when he goes flying in the
      face of the Bible like that? Threescore-and-ten&rsquo;s the mark, and no man
      with a conscience, and a proper sense of what&rsquo;s expected of him, has any
      business to live longer.&rsquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      Is any one surprised at Mr Jonas making such a reference to such a book
      for such a purpose? Does any one doubt the old saw, that the Devil (being
      a layman) quotes Scripture for his own ends? If he will take the trouble
      to look about him, he may find a greater number of confirmations of the
      fact in the occurrences of any single day, than the steam-gun can
      discharge balls in a minute.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;But there&rsquo;s enough of my father,&rsquo; said Jonas; &lsquo;it&rsquo;s of no use to go
      putting one&rsquo;s self out of the way by talking about <i>him</i>. I called to ask
      you to come and take a walk, cousin, and see some of the sights; and to
      come to our house afterwards, and have a bit of something. Pecksniff will
      most likely look in in the evening, he says, and bring you home. See,
      here&rsquo;s his writing; I made him put it down this morning when he told me he
      shouldn&rsquo;t be back before I came here; in case you wouldn&rsquo;t believe me.
      There&rsquo;s nothing like proof, is there? Ha, ha! I say&mdash;you&rsquo;ll bring the
      other one, you know!&rsquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      Miss Charity cast her eyes upon her father&rsquo;s autograph, which merely said&mdash;&lsquo;Go,
      my children, with your cousin. Let there be union among us when it is
      possible;&rsquo; and after enough of hesitation to impart a proper value to her
      consent, withdrew to prepare her sister and herself for the excursion. She
      soon returned, accompanied by Miss Mercy, who was by no means pleased to
      leave the brilliant triumphs of Todgers&rsquo;s for the society of Mr Jonas and
      his respected father.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Aha!&rsquo; cried Jonas. &lsquo;There you are, are you?&rsquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Yes, fright,&rsquo; said Mercy, &lsquo;here I am; and I would much rather be anywhere
      else, I assure you.&rsquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;You don&rsquo;t mean that,&rsquo; cried Mr Jonas. &lsquo;You can&rsquo;t, you know. It isn&rsquo;t
      possible.&rsquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;You can have what opinion you like, fright,&rsquo; retorted Mercy. &lsquo;I am
      content to keep mine; and mine is that you are a very unpleasant, odious,
      disagreeable person.&rsquo; Here she laughed heartily, and seemed to enjoy
      herself very much.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Oh, you&rsquo;re a sharp gal!&rsquo; said Mr Jonas. &lsquo;She&rsquo;s a regular teaser, an&rsquo;t
      she, cousin?&rsquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      Miss Charity replied in effect, that she was unable to say what the habits
      and propensities of a regular teaser might be; and that even if she
      possessed such information, it would ill become her to admit the existence
      of any creature with such an unceremonious name in her family; far less in
      the person of a beloved sister; &lsquo;whatever,&rsquo; added Cherry with an angry
      glance, &lsquo;whatever her real nature may be.&rsquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Well, my dear,&rsquo; said Merry, &lsquo;the only observation I have to make is, that
      if we don&rsquo;t go out at once, I shall certainly take my bonnet off again,
      and stay at home.&rsquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      This threat had the desired effect of preventing any farther altercation,
      for Mr Jonas immediately proposed an adjournment, and the same being
      carried unanimously, they departed from the house straightway. On the
      doorstep, Mr Jonas gave an arm to each cousin; which act of gallantry
      being observed by Bailey junior, from the garret window, was by him
      saluted with a loud and violent fit of coughing, to which paroxysm he was
      still the victim when they turned the corner.
    </p>
    <p>
      Mr Jonas inquired in the first instance if they were good walkers and
      being answered, &lsquo;Yes,&rsquo; submitted their pedestrian powers to a pretty
      severe test; for he showed them as many sights, in the way of bridges,
      churches, streets, outsides of theatres, and other free spectacles, in
      that one forenoon, as most people see in a twelvemonth. It was observable
      in this gentleman, that he had an insurmountable distaste to the insides
      of buildings, and that he was perfectly acquainted with the merits of all
      shows, in respect of which there was any charge for admission, which it
      seemed were every one detestable, and of the very lowest grade of merit.
      He was so thoroughly possessed with this opinion, that when Miss Charity
      happened to mention the circumstance of their having been twice or thrice
      to the theatre with Mr Jinkins and party, he inquired, as a matter of
      course, &lsquo;where the orders came from?&rsquo; and being told that Mr Jinkins and
      party paid, was beyond description entertained, observing that &lsquo;they must
      be nice flats, certainly;&rsquo; and often in the course of the walk, bursting
      out again into a perfect convulsion of laughter at the surpassing
      silliness of those gentlemen, and (doubtless) at his own superior wisdom.
    </p>
    <p>
      When they had been out for some hours and were thoroughly fatigued, it
      being by that time twilight, Mr Jonas intimated that he would show them
      one of the best pieces of fun with which he was acquainted. This joke was
      of a practical kind, and its humour lay in taking a hackney-coach to the
      extreme limits of possibility for a shilling. Happily it brought them to
      the place where Mr Jonas dwelt, or the young ladies might have rather
      missed the point and cream of the jest.
    </p>
    <p>
      The old-established firm of Anthony Chuzzlewit and Son, Manchester
      Warehousemen, and so forth, had its place of business in a very narrow
      street somewhere behind the Post Office; where every house was in the
      brightest summer morning very gloomy; and where light porters watered the
      pavement, each before his own employer&rsquo;s premises, in fantastic patterns,
      in the dog-days; and where spruce gentlemen with their hands in the
      pockets of symmetrical trousers, were always to be seen in warm weather,
      contemplating their undeniable boots in dusty warehouse doorways; which
      appeared to be the hardest work they did, except now and then carrying
      pens behind their ears. A dim, dirty, smoky, tumble-down, rotten old house
      it was, as anybody would desire to see; but there the firm of Anthony
      Chuzzlewit and Son transacted all their business and their pleasure too,
      such as it was; for neither the young man nor the old had any other
      residence, or any care or thought beyond its narrow limits.
    </p>
    <p>
      Business, as may be readily supposed, was the main thing in this
      establishment; insomuch indeed that it shouldered comfort out of doors,
      and jostled the domestic arrangements at every turn. Thus in the miserable
      bedrooms there were files of moth-eaten letters hanging up against the
      walls; and linen rollers, and fragments of old patterns, and odds and ends
      of spoiled goods, strewed upon the ground; while the meagre bedsteads,
      washing-stands, and scraps of carpet, were huddled away into corners as
      objects of secondary consideration, not to be thought of but as
      disagreeable necessities, furnishing no profit, and intruding on the one
      affair of life. The single sitting-room was on the same principle, a chaos
      of boxes and old papers, and had more counting-house stools in it than
      chairs; not to mention a great monster of a desk straddling over the
      middle of the floor, and an iron safe sunk into the wall above the
      fireplace. The solitary little table for purposes of refection and social
      enjoyment, bore as fair a proportion to the desk and other business
      furniture, as the graces and harmless relaxations of life had ever done,
      in the persons of the old man and his son, to their pursuit of wealth. It
      was meanly laid out now for dinner; and in a chair before the fire sat
      Anthony himself, who rose to greet his son and his fair cousins as they
      entered.
    </p>
    <p>
      An ancient proverb warns us that we should not expect to find old heads
      upon young shoulders; to which it may be added that we seldom meet with
      that unnatural combination, but we feel a strong desire to knock them off;
      merely from an inherent love we have of seeing things in their right
      places. It is not improbable that many men, in no wise choleric by nature,
      felt this impulse rising up within them, when they first made the
      acquaintance of Mr Jonas; but if they had known him more intimately in his
      own house, and had sat with him at his own board, it would assuredly have
      been paramount to all other considerations.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Well, ghost!&rsquo; said Mr Jonas, dutifully addressing his parent by that
      title. &lsquo;Is dinner nearly ready?&rsquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;I should think it was,&rsquo; rejoined the old man.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;What&rsquo;s the good of that?&rsquo; rejoined the son. &lsquo;I should think it was. I
      want to know.&rsquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Ah! I don&rsquo;t know for certain,&rsquo; said Anthony.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;You don&rsquo;t know for certain,&rsquo; rejoined his son in a lower tone. &lsquo;No. You
      don&rsquo;t know anything for certain, <i>you </i>don&rsquo;t. Give me your candle here. I
      want it for the gals.&rsquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      Anthony handed him a battered old office candlestick, with which Mr Jonas
      preceded the young ladies to the nearest bedroom, where he left them to
      take off their shawls and bonnets; and returning, occupied himself in
      opening a bottle of wine, sharpening the carving-knife, and muttering
      compliments to his father, until they and the dinner appeared together.
      The repast consisted of a hot leg of mutton with greens and potatoes; and
      the dishes having been set upon the table by a slipshod old woman, they
      were left to enjoy it after their own manner.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Bachelor&rsquo;s Hall, you know, cousin,&rsquo; said Mr Jonas to Charity. &lsquo;I say&mdash;the
      other one will be having a laugh at this when she gets home, won&rsquo;t she?
      Here; you sit on the right side of me, and I&rsquo;ll have her upon the left.
      Other one, will you come here?&rsquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;You&rsquo;re such a fright,&rsquo; replied Mercy, &lsquo;that I know I shall have no
      appetite if I sit so near you; but I suppose I must.&rsquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;An&rsquo;t she lively?&rsquo; whispered Mr Jonas to the elder sister, with his
      favourite elbow emphasis.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Oh I really don&rsquo;t know!&rsquo; replied Miss Pecksniff, tartly. &lsquo;I am tired of
      being asked such ridiculous questions.&rsquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;What&rsquo;s that precious old father of mine about now?&rsquo; said Mr Jonas, seeing
      that his parent was travelling up and down the room instead of taking his
      seat at table. &lsquo;What are you looking for?&rsquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;I&rsquo;ve lost my glasses, Jonas,&rsquo; said old Anthony.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Sit down without your glasses, can&rsquo;t you?&rsquo; returned his son. &lsquo;You don&rsquo;t
      eat or drink out of &lsquo;em, I think; and where&rsquo;s that sleepy-headed old
      Chuffey got to! Now, stupid. Oh! you know your name, do you?&rsquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      It would seem that he didn&rsquo;t, for he didn&rsquo;t come until the father called.
      As he spoke, the door of a small glass office, which was partitioned off
      from the rest of the room, was slowly opened, and a little blear-eyed,
      weazen-faced, ancient man came creeping out. He was of a remote fashion,
      and dusty, like the rest of the furniture; he was dressed in a decayed
      suit of black; with breeches garnished at the knees with rusty wisps of
      ribbon, the very paupers of shoestrings; on the lower portion of his
      spindle legs were dingy worsted stockings of the same colour. He looked as
      if he had been put away and forgotten half a century before, and somebody
      had just found him in a lumber-closet.
    </p>
    <p>
      Such as he was, he came slowly creeping on towards the table, until at
      last he crept into the vacant chair, from which, as his dim faculties
      became conscious of the presence of strangers, and those strangers ladies,
      he rose again, apparently intending to make a bow. But he sat down once
      more without having made it, and breathing on his shrivelled hands to warm
      them, remained with his poor blue nose immovable above his plate, looking
      at nothing, with eyes that saw nothing, and a face that meant nothing.
      Take him in that state, and he was an embodiment of nothing. Nothing else.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Our clerk,&rsquo; said Mr Jonas, as host and master of the ceremonies: &lsquo;Old
      Chuffey.&rsquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Is he deaf?&rsquo; inquired one of the young ladies.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;No, I don&rsquo;t know that he is. He an&rsquo;t deaf, is he, father?&rsquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;I never heard him say he was,&rsquo; replied the old man.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Blind?&rsquo; inquired the young ladies.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;N&mdash;no. I never understood that he was at all blind,&rsquo; said Jonas,
      carelessly. &lsquo;You don&rsquo;t consider him so, do you, father?&rsquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Certainly not,&rsquo; replied Anthony.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;What is he, then?&rsquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Why, I&rsquo;ll tell you what he is,&rsquo; said Mr Jonas, apart to the young ladies,
      &lsquo;he&rsquo;s precious old, for one thing; and I an&rsquo;t best pleased with him for
      that, for I think my father must have caught it of him. He&rsquo;s a strange old
      chap, for another,&rsquo; he added in a louder voice, &lsquo;and don&rsquo;t understand any
      one hardly, but <i>him</i>!&rsquo; He pointed to his honoured parent with the
      carving-fork, in order that they might know whom he meant.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;How very strange!&rsquo; cried the sisters.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Why, you see,&rsquo; said Mr Jonas, &lsquo;he&rsquo;s been addling his old brains with
      figures and book-keeping all his life; and twenty years ago or so he went
      and took a fever. All the time he was out of his head (which was three
      weeks) he never left off casting up; and he got to so many million at last
      that I don&rsquo;t believe he&rsquo;s ever been quite right since. We don&rsquo;t do much
      business now though, and he an&rsquo;t a bad clerk.&rsquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;A very good one,&rsquo; said Anthony.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Well! He an&rsquo;t a dear one at all events,&rsquo; observed Jonas; &lsquo;and he earns
      his salt, which is enough for our look-out. I was telling you that he
      hardly understands any one except my father; he always understands him,
      though, and wakes up quite wonderful. He&rsquo;s been used to his ways so long,
      you see! Why, I&rsquo;ve seen him play whist, with my father for a partner; and
      a good rubber too; when he had no more notion what sort of people he was
      playing against, than you have.&rsquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Has he no appetite?&rsquo; asked Merry.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Oh, yes,&rsquo; said Jonas, plying his own knife and fork very fast. &lsquo;He eats&mdash;when
      he&rsquo;s helped. But he don&rsquo;t care whether he waits a minute or an hour, as
      long as father&rsquo;s here; so when I&rsquo;m at all sharp set, as I am to-day, I
      come to him after I&rsquo;ve taken the edge off my own hunger, you know. Now,
      Chuffey, stupid, are you ready?&rsquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      Chuffey remained immovable.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Always a perverse old file, he was,&rsquo; said Mr Jonas, coolly helping
      himself to another slice. &lsquo;Ask him, father.&rsquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Are you ready for your dinner, Chuffey?&rsquo; asked the old man
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Yes, yes,&rsquo; said Chuffey, lighting up into a sentient human creature at
      the first sound of the voice, so that it was at once a curious and quite a
      moving sight to see him. &lsquo;Yes, yes. Quite ready, Mr Chuzzlewit. Quite
      ready, sir. All ready, all ready, all ready.&rsquo; With that he stopped,
      smilingly, and listened for some further address; but being spoken to no
      more, the light forsook his face by little and little, until he was
      nothing again.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;He&rsquo;ll be very disagreeable, mind,&rsquo; said Jonas, addressing his cousins as
      he handed the old man&rsquo;s portion to his father. &lsquo;He always chokes himself
      when it an&rsquo;t broth. Look at him, now! Did you ever see a horse with such a
      wall-eyed expression as he&rsquo;s got? If it hadn&rsquo;t been for the joke of it I
      wouldn&rsquo;t have let him come in to-day; but I thought he&rsquo;d amuse you.&rsquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      The poor old subject of this humane speech was, happily for himself, as
      unconscious of its purport as of most other remarks that were made in his
      presence. But the mutton being tough, and his gums weak, he quickly
      verified the statement relative to his choking propensities, and underwent
      so much in his attempts to dine, that Mr Jonas was infinitely amused;
      protesting that he had seldom seen him better company in all his life, and
      that he was enough to make a man split his sides with laughing. Indeed, he
      went so far as to assure the sisters, that in this point of view he
      considered Chuffey superior to his own father; which, as he significantly
      added, was saying a great deal.
    </p>
    <p>
      It was strange enough that Anthony Chuzzlewit, himself so old a man,
      should take a pleasure in these gibings of his estimable son at the
      expense of the poor shadow at their table. But he did, unquestionably;
      though not so much&mdash;to do him justice&mdash;with reference to their
      ancient clerk, as in exultation at the sharpness of Jonas. For the same
      reason that young man&rsquo;s coarse allusions, even to himself, filled him with
      a stealthy glee; causing him to rub his hands and chuckle covertly, as if
      he said in his sleeve, &lsquo;I taught him. I trained him. This is the heir of
      my bringing-up. Sly, cunning, and covetous, he&rsquo;ll not squander my money. I
      worked for this; I hoped for this; it has been the great end and aim of my
      life.&rsquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      What a noble end and aim it was to contemplate in the attainment truly!
      But there be some who manufacture idols after the fashion of themselves,
      and fail to worship them when they are made; charging their deformity on
      outraged nature. Anthony was better than these at any rate.
    </p>
    <p>
      Chuffey boggled over his plate so long, that Mr Jonas, losing patience,
      took it from him at last with his own hands, and requested his father to
      signify to that venerable person that he had better &lsquo;peg away at his
      bread;&rsquo; which Anthony did.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Aye, aye!&rsquo; cried the old man, brightening up as before, when this was
      communicated to him in the same voice, &lsquo;quite right, quite right. He&rsquo;s
      your own son, Mr Chuzzlewit! Bless him for a sharp lad! Bless him, bless
      him!&rsquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      Mr Jonas considered this so particularly childish (perhaps with some
      reason), that he only laughed the more, and told his cousins that he was
      afraid one of these fine days, Chuffey would be the death of him. The
      cloth was then removed, and the bottle of wine set upon the table, from
      which Mr Jonas filled the young ladies&rsquo; glasses, calling on them not to
      spare it, as they might be certain there was plenty more where that came
      from. But he added with some haste after this sally that it was only his
      joke, and they wouldn&rsquo;t suppose him to be in earnest, he was sure.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;I shall drink,&rsquo; said Anthony, &lsquo;to Pecksniff. Your father, my dears. A
      clever man, Pecksniff. A wary man! A hypocrite, though, eh? A hypocrite,
      girls, eh? Ha, ha, ha! Well, so he is. Now, among friends, he is. I don&rsquo;t
      think the worse of him for that, unless it is that he overdoes it. You may
      overdo anything, my darlings. You may overdo even hypocrisy. Ask Jonas!&rsquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;You can&rsquo;t overdo taking care of yourself,&rsquo; observed that hopeful
      gentleman with his mouth full.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Do you hear that, my dears?&rsquo; cried Anthony, quite enraptured. &lsquo;Wisdom,
      wisdom! A good exception, Jonas. No. It&rsquo;s not easy to overdo that.&rsquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Except,&rsquo; whispered Mr Jonas to his favourite cousin, &lsquo;except when one
      lives too long. Ha, ha! Tell the other one that&mdash;I say!&rsquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Good gracious me!&rsquo; said Cherry, in a petulant manner. &lsquo;You can tell her
      yourself, if you wish, can&rsquo;t you?&rsquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;She seems to make such game of one,&rsquo; replied Mr Jonas.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Then why need you trouble yourself about her?&rsquo; said Charity. &lsquo;I am sure
      she doesn&rsquo;t trouble herself much about you.&rsquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Don&rsquo;t she though?&rsquo; asked Jonas.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Good gracious me, need I tell you that she don&rsquo;t?&rsquo; returned the young
      lady.
    </p>
    <p>
      Mr Jonas made no verbal rejoinder, but he glanced at Mercy with an odd
      expression in his face; and said <i>that </i>wouldn&rsquo;t break his heart, she might
      depend upon it. Then he looked on Charity with even greater favour than
      before, and besought her, as his polite manner was, to &lsquo;come a little
      closer.&rsquo;
    </p>
<div class="fig" style="width:65%">

    </h5>
    <p>
      &lsquo;There&rsquo;s another thing that&rsquo;s not easily overdone, father,&rsquo; remarked
      Jonas, after a short silence.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;What&rsquo;s that?&rsquo; asked the father; grinning already in anticipation.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;A bargain,&rsquo; said the son. &lsquo;Here&rsquo;s the rule for bargains&mdash;&ldquo;Do other
      men, for they would do you.&rdquo; That&rsquo;s the true business precept. All others
      are counterfeits.&rsquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      The delighted father applauded this sentiment to the echo; and was so much
      tickled by it, that he was at the pains of imparting the same to his
      ancient clerk, who rubbed his hands, nodded his palsied head, winked his
      watery eyes, and cried in his whistling tones, &lsquo;Good! good! Your own son,
      Mr Chuzzlewit&rsquo; with every feeble demonstration of delight that he was
      capable of making. But this old man&rsquo;s enthusiasm had the redeeming quality
      of being felt in sympathy with the only creature to whom he was linked by
      ties of long association, and by his present helplessness. And if there
      had been anybody there, who cared to think about it, some dregs of a
      better nature unawakened, might perhaps have been descried through that
      very medium, melancholy though it was, yet lingering at the bottom of the
      worn-out cask called Chuffey.
    </p>
    <p>
      As matters stood, nobody thought or said anything upon the subject; so
      Chuffey fell back into a dark corner on one side of the fireplace, where
      he always spent his evenings, and was neither seen nor heard again that
      night; save once, when a cup of tea was given him, in which he was seen to
      soak his bread mechanically. There was no reason to suppose that he went
      to sleep at these seasons, or that he heard, or saw, or felt, or thought.
      He remained, as it were, frozen up&mdash;if any term expressive of such a
      vigorous process can be applied to him&mdash;until he was again thawed for
      the moment by a word or touch from Anthony.
    </p>
    <p>
      Miss Charity made tea by desire of Mr Jonas, and felt and looked so like
      the lady of the house that she was in the prettiest confusion imaginable;
      the more so from Mr Jonas sitting close beside her, and whispering a
      variety of admiring expressions in her ear. Miss Mercy, for her part, felt
      the entertainment of the evening to be so distinctly and exclusively
      theirs, that she silently deplored the commercial gentlemen&mdash;at that
      moment, no doubt, wearying for her return&mdash;and yawned over
      yesterday&rsquo;s newspaper. As to Anthony, he went to sleep outright, so Jonas
      and Cherry had a clear stage to themselves as long as they chose to keep
      possession of it.
    </p>
    <p>
      When the tea-tray was taken away, as it was at last, Mr Jonas produced a
      dirty pack of cards, and entertained the sisters with divers small feats
      of dexterity: whereof the main purpose of every one was, that you were to
      decoy somebody into laying a wager with you that you couldn&rsquo;t do it; and
      were then immediately to win and pocket his money. Mr Jonas informed them
      that these accomplishments were in high vogue in the most intellectual
      circles, and that large amounts were constantly changing hands on such
      hazards. And it may be remarked that he fully believed this; for there is
      a simplicity of cunning no less than a simplicity of innocence; and in all
      matters where a lively faith in knavery and meanness was required as the
      ground-work of belief, Mr Jonas was one of the most credulous of men. His
      ignorance, which was stupendous, may be taken into account, if the reader
      pleases, separately.

    <p>
      This fine young man had all the inclination to be a profligate of the
      first water, and only lacked the one good trait in the common catalogue of
      debauched vices&mdash;open-handedness&mdash;to be a notable vagabond. But
      there his griping and penurious habits stepped in; and as one poison will
      sometimes neutralise another, when wholesome remedies would not avail, so
      he was restrained by a bad passion from quaffing his full measure of evil,
      when virtue might have sought to hold him back in vain.
    </p>
    <p>
      By the time he had unfolded all the peddling schemes he knew upon the
      cards, it was growing late in the evening; and Mr Pecksniff not making his
      appearance, the young ladies expressed a wish to return home. But this, Mr
      Jonas, in his gallantry, would by no means allow, until they had partaken
      of some bread and cheese and porter; and even then he was excessively
      unwilling to allow them to depart; often beseeching Miss Charity to come a
      little closer, or to stop a little longer, and preferring many other
      complimentary petitions of that nature in his own hospitable and earnest
      way. When all his efforts to detain them were fruitless, he put on his hat
      and greatcoat preparatory to escorting them to Todgers&rsquo;s; remarking that
      he knew they would rather walk thither than ride; and that for his part he
      was quite of their opinion.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Good night,&rsquo; said Anthony. &lsquo;Good night; remember me to&mdash;ha, ha, ha!&mdash;to
      Pecksniff. Take care of your cousin, my dears; beware of Jonas; he&rsquo;s a
      dangerous fellow. Don&rsquo;t quarrel for him, in any case!&rsquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Oh, the creature!&rsquo; cried Mercy. &lsquo;The idea of quarrelling for <i>him</i>! You may
      take him, Cherry, my love, all to yourself. I make you a present of my
      share.&rsquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;What! I&rsquo;m a sour grape, am I, cousin?&rsquo; said Jonas.
    </p>
    <p>
      Miss Charity was more entertained by this repartee than one would have
      supposed likely, considering its advanced age and simple character. But in
      her sisterly affection she took Mr Jonas to task for leaning so very hard
      upon a broken reed, and said that he must not be so cruel to poor Merry
      any more, or she (Charity) would positively be obliged to hate him. Mercy,
      who really had her share of good humour, only retorted with a laugh; and
      they walked home in consequence without any angry passages of words upon
      the way. Mr Jonas being in the middle, and having a cousin on each arm,
      sometimes squeezed the wrong one; so tightly too, as to cause her not a
      little inconvenience; but as he talked to Charity in whispers the whole
      time, and paid her great attention, no doubt this was an accidental
      circumstance. When they arrived at Todgers&rsquo;s, and the door was opened,
      Mercy broke hastily from them, and ran upstairs; but Charity and Jonas
      lingered on the steps talking together for more than five minutes; so, as
      Mrs Todgers observed next morning, to a third party, &lsquo;It was pretty clear
      what was going on <i>there</i>, and she was glad of it, for it really was high
      time that Miss Pecksniff thought of settling.&rsquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      And now the day was coming on, when that bright vision which had burst on
      Todgers&rsquo;s so suddenly, and made a sunshine in the shady breast of Jinkins,
      was to be seen no more; when it was to be packed, like a brown paper
      parcel, or a fish-basket, or an oyster barrel or a fat gentleman, or any
      other dull reality of life, in a stagecoach and carried down into the
      country.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Never, my dear Miss Pecksniffs,&rsquo; said Mrs Todgers, when they retired to
      rest on the last night of their stay, &lsquo;never have I seen an establishment
      so perfectly broken-hearted as mine is at this present moment of time. I
      don&rsquo;t believe the gentlemen will be the gentlemen they were, or anything
      like it&mdash;no, not for weeks to come. You have a great deal to answer
      for, both of you.&rsquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      They modestly disclaimed any wilful agency in this disastrous state of
      things, and regretted it very much.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Your pious pa, too,&rsquo; said Mrs Todgers. &lsquo;There&rsquo;s a loss! My dear Miss
      Pecksniffs, your pa is a perfect missionary of peace and love.&rsquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      Entertaining an uncertainty as to the particular kind of love supposed to
      be comprised in Mr Pecksniff&rsquo;s mission, the young ladies received the
      compliment rather coldly.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;If I dared,&rsquo; said Mrs Todgers, perceiving this, &lsquo;to violate a confidence
      which has been reposed in me, and to tell you why I must beg of you to
      leave the little door between your room and mine open tonight, I think you
      would be interested. But I mustn&rsquo;t do it, for I promised Mr Jinkins
      faithfully, that I would be as silent as the tomb.&rsquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Dear Mrs Todgers! What can you mean?&rsquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Why, then, my sweet Miss Pecksniffs,&rsquo; said the lady of the house; &lsquo;my own
      loves, if you will allow me the privilege of taking that freedom on the
      eve of our separation, Mr Jinkins and the gentlemen have made up a little
      musical party among themselves, and <i>do</i> intend, in the dead of this night,
      to perform a serenade upon the stairs outside the door. I could have
      wished, I own,&rsquo; said Mrs Todgers, with her usual foresight, &lsquo;that it had
      been fixed to take place an hour or two earlier; because when gentlemen
      sit up late they drink, and when they drink they&rsquo;re not so musical,
      perhaps, as when they don&rsquo;t. But this is the arrangement; and I know you
      will be gratified, my dear Miss Pecksniffs, by such a mark of their
      attention.&rsquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      The young ladies were at first so much excited by the news, that they
      vowed they couldn&rsquo;t think of going to bed until the serenade was over. But
      half an hour of cool waiting so altered their opinion that they not only
      went to bed, but fell asleep; and were, moreover, not ecstatically charmed
      to be awakened some time afterwards by certain dulcet strains breaking in
      upon the silent watches of the night.
    </p>
    <p>
      It was very affecting&mdash;very. Nothing more dismal could have been
      desired by the most fastidious taste. The gentleman of a vocal turn was
      head mute, or chief mourner; Jinkins took the bass; and the rest took
      anything they could get. The youngest gentleman blew his melancholy into a
      flute. He didn&rsquo;t blow much out of it, but that was all the better. If the
      two Miss Pecksniffs and Mrs Todgers had perished by spontaneous
      combustion, and the serenade had been in honour of their ashes, it would
      have been impossible to surpass the unutterable despair expressed in that
      one chorus, &lsquo;Go where glory waits thee!&rsquo; It was a requiem, a dirge, a
      moan, a howl, a wail, a lament, an abstract of everything that is
      sorrowful and hideous in sound. The flute of the youngest gentleman was
      wild and fitful. It came and went in gusts, like the wind. For a long time
      together he seemed to have left off, and when it was quite settled by Mrs
      Todgers and the young ladies that, overcome by his feelings, he had
      retired in tears, he unexpectedly turned up again at the very top of the
      tune, gasping for breath. He was a tremendous performer. There was no
      knowing where to have him; and exactly when you thought he was doing
      nothing at all, then was he doing the very thing that ought to astonish
      you most.
    </p>
    <p>
      There were several of these concerted pieces; perhaps two or three too
      many, though that, as Mrs Todgers said, was a fault on the right side. But
      even then, even at that solemn moment, when the thrilling sounds may be
      presumed to have penetrated into the very depths of his nature, if he had
      any depths, Jinkins couldn&rsquo;t leave the youngest gentleman alone. He asked
      him distinctly, before the second song began&mdash;as a personal favour
      too, mark the villain in that&mdash;not to play. Yes; he said so; not to
      play. The breathing of the youngest gentleman was heard through the
      key-hole of the door. He <i>didn&rsquo;t</i> play. What vent was a flute for the
      passions swelling up within his breast? A trombone would have been a world
      too mild.
    </p>
    <p>
      The serenade approached its close. Its crowning interest was at hand. The
      gentleman of a literary turn had written a song on the departure of the
      ladies, and adapted it to an old tune. They all joined, except the
      youngest gentleman in company, who, for the reasons aforesaid, maintained
      a fearful silence. The song (which was of a classical nature) invoked the
      oracle of Apollo, and demanded to know what would become of Todgers&rsquo;s when
      <i>CHARITY </i>and <i>MERCY </i>were banished from its walls. The oracle delivered no
      opinion particularly worth remembering, according to the not infrequent
      practice of oracles from the earliest ages down to the present time. In
      the absence of enlightenment on that subject, the strain deserted it, and
      went on to show that the Miss Pecksniffs were nearly related to Rule
      Britannia, and that if Great Britain hadn&rsquo;t been an island, there could
      have been no Miss Pecksniffs. And being now on a nautical tack, it closed
      with this verse:
    </p>
<pre xml:space="preserve">
     &lsquo;All hail to the vessel of Pecksniff the sire!
            And favouring breezes to fan;
     While Tritons flock round it, and proudly admire
            The architect, artist, and man!&rsquo;
</pre>
    <p>
      As they presented this beautiful picture to the imagination, the gentlemen
      gradually withdrew to bed to give the music the effect of distance; and so
      it died away, and Todgers&rsquo;s was left to its repose.
    </p>
    <p>
      Mr Bailey reserved his vocal offering until the morning, when he put his
      head into the room as the young ladies were kneeling before their trunks,
      packing up, and treated them to an imitation of the voice of a young dog
      in trying circumstances; when that animal is supposed by persons of a
      lively fancy, to relieve his feelings by calling for pen and ink.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Well, young ladies,&rsquo; said the youth, &lsquo;so you&rsquo;re a-going home, are you,
      worse luck?&rsquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Yes, Bailey, we&rsquo;re going home,&rsquo; returned Mercy.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;An&rsquo;t you a-going to leave none of &lsquo;em a lock of your hair?&rsquo; inquired the
      youth. &lsquo;It&rsquo;s real, an&rsquo;t it?&rsquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      They laughed at this, and told him of course it was.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Oh, is it of course, though?&rsquo; said Bailey. &lsquo;I know better than that. Hers
      an&rsquo;t. Why, I see it hanging up once, on that nail by the winder. Besides,
      I have gone behind her at dinner-time and pulled it; and she never know&rsquo;d.
      I say, young ladies, I&rsquo;m a-going to leave. I an&rsquo;t a-going to stand being
      called names by her, no longer.&rsquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      Miss Mercy inquired what his plans for the future might be; in reply to
      whom Mr Bailey intimated that he thought of going either into top-boots,
      or into the army.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Into the army!&rsquo; cried the young ladies, with a laugh.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Ah!&rsquo; said Bailey, &lsquo;why not? There&rsquo;s a many drummers in the Tower. I&rsquo;m
      acquainted with &lsquo;em. Don&rsquo;t their country set a valley on &lsquo;em, mind you!
      Not at all!&rsquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;You&rsquo;ll be shot, I see,&rsquo; observed Mercy.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Well!&rsquo; cried Mr Bailey, &lsquo;wot if I am? There&rsquo;s something gamey in it,
      young ladies, an&rsquo;t there? I&rsquo;d sooner be hit with a cannon-ball than a
      rolling-pin, and she&rsquo;s always a-catching up something of that sort, and
      throwing it at me, when the gentlemans&rsquo; appetites is good. Wot,&rsquo; said Mr
      Bailey, stung by the recollection of his wrongs, &lsquo;wot, if they <i>do</i> consume
      the per-vishuns. It an&rsquo;t <i>my</i> fault, is it?&rsquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Surely no one says it is,&rsquo; said Mercy.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Don&rsquo;t they though?&rsquo; retorted the youth. &lsquo;No. Yes. Ah! oh! No one mayn&rsquo;t
      say it is! but some one knows it is. But I an&rsquo;t a-going to have every rise
      in prices wisited on me. I an&rsquo;t a-going to be killed because the markets
      is dear. I won&rsquo;t stop. And therefore,&rsquo; added Mr Bailey, relenting into a
      smile, &lsquo;wotever you mean to give me, you&rsquo;d better give me all at once,
      becos if ever you come back agin, I shan&rsquo;t be here; and as to the other
      boy, <i>he</i> won&rsquo;t deserve nothing, I know.&rsquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      The young ladies, on behalf of Mr Pecksniff and themselves, acted on this
      thoughtful advice; and in consideration of their private friendship,
      presented Mr Bailey with a gratuity so liberal that he could hardly do
      enough to show his gratitude; which found but an imperfect vent, during
      the remainder of the day, in divers secret slaps upon his pocket, and
      other such facetious pantomime. Nor was it confined to these ebullitions;
      for besides crushing a bandbox, with a bonnet in it, he seriously damaged
      Mr Pecksniff&rsquo;s luggage, by ardently hauling it down from the top of the
      house; and in short evinced, by every means in his power, a lively sense
      of the favours he had received from that gentleman and his family.
    </p>
    <p>
      Mr Pecksniff and Mr Jinkins came home to dinner arm-in-arm; for the latter
      gentleman had made half-holiday on purpose; thus gaining an immense
      advantage over the youngest gentleman and the rest, whose time, as it
      perversely chanced, was all bespoke, until the evening. The bottle of wine
      was Mr Pecksniff&rsquo;s treat, and they were very sociable indeed; though full
      of lamentations on the necessity of parting. While they were in the midst
      of their enjoyment, old Anthony and his son were announced; much to the
      surprise of Mr Pecksniff, and greatly to the discomfiture of Jinkins.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Come to say good-bye, you see,&rsquo; said Anthony, in a low voice, to Mr
      Pecksniff, as they took their seats apart at the table, while the rest
      conversed among themselves. &lsquo;Where&rsquo;s the use of a division between you and
      me? We are the two halves of a pair of scissors, when apart, Pecksniff;
      but together we are something. Eh?&rsquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Unanimity, my good sir,&rsquo; rejoined Mr Pecksniff, &lsquo;is always delightful.&rsquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;I don&rsquo;t know about that,&rsquo; said the old man, &lsquo;for there are some people I
      would rather differ from than agree with. But you know my opinion of you.&rsquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      Mr Pecksniff, still having &lsquo;hypocrite&rsquo; in his mind, only replied by a
      motion of his head, which was something between an affirmative bow, and a
      negative shake.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Complimentary,&rsquo; said Anthony. &lsquo;Complimentary, upon my word. It was an
      involuntary tribute to your abilities, even at the time; and it was not a
      time to suggest compliments either. But we agreed in the coach, you know,
      that we quite understood each other.&rsquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Oh, quite!&rsquo; assented Mr Pecksniff, in a manner which implied that he
      himself was misunderstood most cruelly, but would not complain.
    </p>
    <p>
      Anthony glanced at his son as he sat beside Miss Charity, and then at Mr
      Pecksniff, and then at his son again, very many times. It happened that Mr
      Pecksniff&rsquo;s glances took a similar direction; but when he became aware of
      it, he first cast down his eyes, and then closed them; as if he were
      determined that the old man should read nothing there.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Jonas is a shrewd lad,&rsquo; said the old man.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;He appears,&rsquo; rejoined Mr Pecksniff in his most candid manner, &lsquo;to be very
      shrewd.&rsquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;And careful,&rsquo; said the old man.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;And careful, I have no doubt,&rsquo; returned Mr Pecksniff.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Look ye!&rsquo; said Anthony in his ear. &lsquo;I think he is sweet upon you
      daughter.&rsquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Tut, my good sir,&rsquo; said Mr Pecksniff, with his eyes still closed; &lsquo;young
      people&mdash;young people&mdash;a kind of cousins, too&mdash;no more
      sweetness than is in that, sir.&rsquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Why, there is very little sweetness in that, according to our
      experience,&rsquo; returned Anthony. &lsquo;Isn&rsquo;t there a trifle more here?&rsquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Impossible to say,&rsquo; rejoined Mr Pecksniff. &lsquo;Quite impossible! You
      surprise me.&rsquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Yes, I know that,&rsquo; said the old man, drily. &lsquo;It may last; I mean the
      sweetness, not the surprise; and it may die off. Supposing it should last,
      perhaps (you having feathered your nest pretty well, and I having done the
      same), we might have a mutual interest in the matter.&rsquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      Mr Pecksniff, smiling gently, was about to speak, but Anthony stopped him.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;I know what you are going to say. It&rsquo;s quite unnecessary. You have never
      thought of this for a moment; and in a point so nearly affecting the
      happiness of your dear child, you couldn&rsquo;t, as a tender father, express an
      opinion; and so forth. Yes, quite right. And like you! But it seems to me,
      my dear Pecksniff,&rsquo; added Anthony, laying his hand upon his sleeve, &lsquo;that
      if you and I kept up the joke of pretending not to see this, one of us
      might possibly be placed in a position of disadvantage; and as I am very
      unwilling to be that party myself, you will excuse my taking the liberty
      of putting the matter beyond a doubt thus early; and having it distinctly
      understood, as it is now, that we do see it, and do know it. Thank you for
      your attention. We are now upon an equal footing; which is agreeable to us
      both, I am sure.&rsquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      He rose as he spoke; and giving Mr Pecksniff a nod of intelligence, moved
      away from him to where the young people were sitting; leaving that good
      man somewhat puzzled and discomfited by such very plain dealing, and not
      quite free from a sense of having been foiled in the exercise of his
      familiar weapons.
    </p>
    <p>
      But the night-coach had a punctual character, and it was time to join it
      at the office; which was so near at hand that they had already sent their
      luggage and arranged to walk. Thither the whole party repaired, therefore,
      after no more delay than sufficed for the equipment of the Miss Pecksniffs
      and Mrs Todgers. They found the coach already at its starting-place, and
      the horses in; there, too, were a large majority of the commercial
      gentlemen, including the youngest, who was visibly agitated, and in a
      state of deep mental dejection.
    </p>
    <p>
      Nothing could equal the distress of Mrs Todgers in parting from the young
      ladies, except the strong emotions with which she bade adieu to Mr
      Pecksniff. Never surely was a pocket-handkerchief taken in and out of a
      flat reticule so often as Mrs Todgers&rsquo;s was, as she stood upon the
      pavement by the coach-door supported on either side by a commercial
      gentleman; and by the sight of the coach-lamps caught such brief snatches
      and glimpses of the good man&rsquo;s face, as the constant interposition of Mr
      Jinkins allowed. For Jinkins, to the last the youngest gentleman&rsquo;s rock
      a-head in life, stood upon the coachstep talking to the ladies. Upon the
      other step was Mr Jonas, who maintained that position in right of his
      cousinship; whereas the youngest gentleman, who had been first upon the
      ground, was deep in the booking-office among the black and red placards,
      and the portraits of fast coaches, where he was ignominiously harassed by
      porters, and had to contend and strive perpetually with heavy baggage.
      This false position, combined with his nervous excitement, brought about
      the very consummation and catastrophe of his miseries; for when in the
      moment of parting he aimed a flower, a hothouse flower that had cost
      money, at the fair hand of Mercy, it reached, instead, the coachman on the
      box, who thanked him kindly, and stuck it in his buttonhole.
    </p>
    <p>
      They were off now; and Todgers&rsquo;s was alone again. The two young ladies,
      leaning back in their separate corners, resigned themselves to their own
      regretful thoughts. But Mr Pecksniff, dismissing all ephemeral
      considerations of social pleasure and enjoyment, concentrated his
      meditations on the one great virtuous purpose before him, of casting out
      that ingrate and deceiver, whose presence yet troubled his domestic
      hearth, and was a sacrilege upon the altars of his household gods.

      CHAPTER TWELVE
    </h2>
    <p>
      WILL BE SEEN IN THE LONG RUN, IF NOT IN THE SHORT ONE, TO CONCERN MR PINCH
      AND OTHERS, NEARLY. MR PECKSNIFF ASSERTS THE DIGNITY OF OUTRAGED VIRTUE.
      YOUNG MARTIN CHUZZLEWIT FORMS A DESPERATE RESOLUTION
    </p>
    <p>
      Mr Pinch and Martin, little dreaming of the stormy weather that impended,
      made themselves very comfortable in the Pecksniffian halls, and improved
      their friendship daily. Martin&rsquo;s facility, both of invention and
      execution, being remarkable, the grammar-school proceeded with great
      vigour; and Tom repeatedly declared, that if there were anything like
      certainty in human affairs, or impartiality in human judges, a design so
      new and full of merit could not fail to carry off the first prize when the
      time of competition arrived. Without being quite so sanguine himself,
      Martin had his hopeful anticipations too; and they served to make him
      brisk and eager at his task.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;If I should turn out a great architect, Tom,&rsquo; said the new pupil one day,
      as he stood at a little distance from his drawing, and eyed it with much
      complacency, &lsquo;I&rsquo;ll tell you what should be one of the things I&rsquo;d build.&rsquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Aye!&rsquo; cried Tom. &lsquo;What?&rsquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Why, your fortune.&rsquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;No!&rsquo; said Tom Pinch, quite as much delighted as if the thing were done.
      &lsquo;Would you though? How kind of you to say so.&rsquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;I&rsquo;d build it up, Tom,&rsquo; returned Martin, &lsquo;on such a strong foundation,
      that it should last your life&mdash;aye, and your children&rsquo;s lives too,
      and their children&rsquo;s after them. I&rsquo;d be your patron, Tom. I&rsquo;d take you
      under my protection. Let me see the man who should give the cold shoulder
      to anybody I chose to protect and patronise, if I were at the top of the
      tree, Tom!&rsquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Now, I don&rsquo;t think,&rsquo; said Mr Pinch, &lsquo;upon my word, that I was ever more
      gratified than by this. I really don&rsquo;t.&rsquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Oh! I mean what I say,&rsquo; retorted Martin, with a manner as free and easy
      in its condescension to, not to say in its compassion for, the other, as
      if he were already First Architect in ordinary to all the Crowned Heads in
      Europe. &lsquo;I&rsquo;d do it. I&rsquo;d provide for you.&rsquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;I am afraid,&rsquo; said Tom, shaking his head, &lsquo;that I should be a mighty
      awkward person to provide for.&rsquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Pooh, pooh!&rsquo; rejoined Martin. &lsquo;Never mind that. If I took it in my head
      to say, &ldquo;Pinch is a clever fellow; I approve of Pinch;&rdquo; I should like to
      know the man who would venture to put himself in opposition to me.
      Besides, confound it, Tom, you could be useful to me in a hundred ways.&rsquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;If I were not useful in one or two, it shouldn&rsquo;t be for want of trying,&rsquo;
      said Tom.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;For instance,&rsquo; pursued Martin, after a short reflection, &lsquo;you&rsquo;d be a
      capital fellow, now, to see that my ideas were properly carried out; and
      to overlook the works in their progress before they were sufficiently
      advanced to be very interesting to <i>me</i>; and to take all that sort of plain
      sailing. Then you&rsquo;d be a splendid fellow to show people over my studio,
      and to talk about Art to &lsquo;em, when I couldn&rsquo;t be bored myself, and all
      that kind of thing. For it would be devilish creditable, Tom (I&rsquo;m quite in
      earnest, I give you my word), to have a man of your information about one,
      instead of some ordinary blockhead. Oh, I&rsquo;d take care of you. You&rsquo;d be
      useful, rely upon it!&rsquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      To say that Tom had no idea of playing first fiddle in any social
      orchestra, but was always quite satisfied to be set down for the hundred
      and fiftieth violin in the band, or thereabouts, is to express his modesty
      in very inadequate terms. He was much delighted, therefore, by these
      observations.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;I should be married to her then, Tom, of course,&rsquo; said Martin.
    </p>
    <p>
      What was that which checked Tom Pinch so suddenly, in the high flow of his
      gladness; bringing the blood into his honest cheeks, and a remorseful
      feeling to his honest heart, as if he were unworthy of his friend&rsquo;s
      regard?
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;I should be married to her then,&rsquo; said Martin, looking with a smile
      towards the light; &lsquo;and we should have, I hope, children about us. They&rsquo;d
      be very fond of you, Tom.&rsquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      But not a word said Mr Pinch. The words he would have uttered died upon
      his lips, and found a life more spiritual in self-denying thoughts.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;All the children hereabouts are fond of you, Tom, and mine would be, of
      course,&rsquo; pursued Martin. &lsquo;Perhaps I might name one of &lsquo;em after you. Tom,
      eh? Well, I don&rsquo;t know. Tom&rsquo;s not a bad name. Thomas Pinch Chuzzlewit. T.
      P. C. on his pinafores&mdash;no objection to that, I should say?&rsquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      Tom cleared his throat, and smiled.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;<i>She </i>would like you, Tom, I know,&rsquo; said Martin.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Aye!&rsquo; cried Tom Pinch, faintly.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;I can tell exactly what she would think of you,&rsquo; said Martin leaning his
      chin upon his hand, and looking through the window-glass as if he read
      there what he said; &lsquo;I know her so well. She would smile, Tom, often at
      first when you spoke to her, or when she looked at you&mdash;merrily too&mdash;but
      you wouldn&rsquo;t mind that. A brighter smile you never saw.&rsquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;No, no,&rsquo; said Tom. &lsquo;I wouldn&rsquo;t mind that.&rsquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;She would be as tender with you, Tom,&rsquo; said Martin, &lsquo;as if you were a
      child yourself. So you are almost, in some things, an&rsquo;t you, Tom?&rsquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      Mr Pinch nodded his entire assent.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;She would always be kind and good-humoured, and glad to see you,&rsquo; said
      Martin; &lsquo;and when she found out exactly what sort of fellow you were
      (which she&rsquo;d do very soon), she would pretend to give you little
      commissions to execute, and to ask little services of you, which she knew
      you were burning to render; so that when she really pleased you most, she
      would try to make you think you most pleased her. She would take to you
      uncommonly, Tom; and would understand you far more delicately than I ever
      shall; and would often say, I know, that you were a harmless, gentle,
      well-intentioned, good fellow.&rsquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      How silent Tom Pinch was!
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;In honour of old time,&rsquo; said Martin, &lsquo;and of her having heard you play
      the organ in this damp little church down here&mdash;for nothing too&mdash;we
      will have one in the house. I shall build an architectural music-room on a
      plan of my own, and it&rsquo;ll look rather knowing in a recess at one end.
      There you shall play away, Tom, till you tire yourself; and, as you like
      to do so in the dark, it shall <i>be</i> dark; and many&rsquo;s the summer evening she
      and I will sit and listen to you, Tom; be sure of that!&rsquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      It may have required a stronger effort on Tom Pinch&rsquo;s part to leave the
      seat on which he sat, and shake his friend by both hands, with nothing but
      serenity and grateful feeling painted on his face; it may have required a
      stronger effort to perform this simple act with a pure heart, than to
      achieve many and many a deed to which the doubtful trumpet blown by Fame
      has lustily resounded. Doubtful, because from its long hovering over
      scenes of violence, the smoke and steam of death have clogged the keys of
      that brave instrument; and it is not always that its notes are either true
      or tuneful.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;It&rsquo;s a proof of the kindness of human nature,&rsquo; said Tom,
      characteristically putting himself quite out of sight in the matter, &lsquo;that
      everybody who comes here, as you have done, is more considerate and
      affectionate to me than I should have any right to hope, if I were the
      most sanguine creature in the world; or should have any power to express,
      if I were the most eloquent. It really overpowers me. But trust me,&rsquo; said
      Tom, &lsquo;that I am not ungrateful&mdash;that I never forget&mdash;and that if
      I can ever prove the truth of my words to you, I will.&rsquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;That&rsquo;s all right,&rsquo; observed Martin, leaning back in his chair with a hand
      in each pocket, and yawning drearily. &lsquo;Very fine talking, Tom; but I&rsquo;m at
      Pecksniff&rsquo;s, I remember, and perhaps a mile or so out of the high-road to
      fortune just at this minute. So you&rsquo;ve heard again this morning from
      what&rsquo;s his name, eh?&rsquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Who may that be?&rsquo; asked Tom, seeming to enter a mild protest on behalf of
      the dignity of an absent person.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;<i>You </i>know. What is it? Northkey.&rsquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Westlock,&rsquo; rejoined Tom, in rather a louder tone than usual.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Ah! to be sure,&rsquo; said Martin, &lsquo;Westlock. I knew it was something
      connected with a point of the compass and a door. Well! and what says
      Westlock?&rsquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Oh! he has come into his property,&rsquo; answered Tom, nodding his head, and
      smiling.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;He&rsquo;s a lucky dog,&rsquo; said Martin. &lsquo;I wish it were mine instead. Is that all
      the mystery you were to tell me?&rsquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;No,&rsquo; said Tom; &lsquo;not all.&rsquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;What&rsquo;s the rest?&rsquo; asked Martin.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;For the matter of that,&rsquo; said Tom, &lsquo;it&rsquo;s no mystery, and you won&rsquo;t think
      much of it; but it&rsquo;s very pleasant to me. John always used to say when he
      was here, &ldquo;Mark my words, Pinch. When my father&rsquo;s executors cash up&rdquo;&mdash;he
      used strange expressions now and then, but that was his way.&rsquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Cash-up&rsquo;s a very good expression,&rsquo; observed Martin, &lsquo;when other people
      don&rsquo;t apply it to you. Well!&mdash;What a slow fellow you are, Pinch!&rsquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Yes, I am I know,&rsquo; said Tom; &lsquo;but you&rsquo;ll make me nervous if you tell me
      so. I&rsquo;m afraid you have put me out a little now, for I forget what I was
      going to say.&rsquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;When John&rsquo;s father&rsquo;s executors cashed up,&rsquo; said Martin impatiently.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Oh yes, to be sure,&rsquo; cried Tom; &lsquo;yes. &ldquo;Then,&rdquo; says John, &ldquo;I&rsquo;ll give you a
      dinner, Pinch, and come down to Salisbury on purpose.&rdquo; Now, when John
      wrote the other day&mdash;the morning Pecksniff left, you know&mdash;he
      said his business was on the point of being immediately settled, and as he
      was to receive his money directly, when could I meet him at Salisbury? I
      wrote and said, any day this week; and I told him besides, that there was
      a new pupil here, and what a fine fellow you were, and what friends we had
      become. Upon which John writes back this letter&rsquo;&mdash;Tom produced it&mdash;&lsquo;fixes
      to-morrow; sends his compliments to you; and begs that we three may have
      the pleasure of dining together; not at the house where you and I were,
      either; but at the very first hotel in the town. Read what he says.&rsquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Very well,&rsquo; said Martin, glancing over it with his customary coolness;
      &lsquo;much obliged to him. I&rsquo;m agreeable.&rsquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      Tom could have wished him to be a little more astonished, a little more
      pleased, or in some form or other a little more interested in such a great
      event. But he was perfectly self-possessed; and falling into his favourite
      solace of whistling, took another turn at the grammar-school, as if
      nothing at all had happened.
    </p>
    <p>
      Mr Pecksniff&rsquo;s horse being regarded in the light of a sacred animal, only
      to be driven by him, the chief priest of that temple, or by some person
      distinctly nominated for the time being to that high office by himself,
      the two young men agreed to walk to Salisbury; and so, when the time came,
      they set off on foot; which was, after all, a better mode of travelling
      than in the gig, as the weather was very cold and very dry.
    </p>
    <p>
      Better! A rare strong, hearty, healthy walk&mdash;four statute miles an
      hour&mdash;preferable to that rumbling, tumbling, jolting, shaking,
      scraping, creaking, villanous old gig? Why, the two things will not admit
      of comparison. It is an insult to the walk, to set them side by side.
      Where is an instance of a gig having ever circulated a man&rsquo;s blood, unless
      when, putting him in danger of his neck, it awakened in his veins and in
      his ears, and all along his spine, a tingling heat, much more peculiar
      than agreeable? When did a gig ever sharpen anybody&rsquo;s wits and energies,
      unless it was when the horse bolted, and, crashing madly down a steep hill
      with a stone wall at the bottom, his desperate circumstances suggested to
      the only gentleman left inside, some novel and unheard-of mode of dropping
      out behind? Better than the gig!
    </p>
    <p>
      The air was cold, Tom; so it was, there was no denying it; but would it
      have been more genial in the gig? The blacksmith&rsquo;s fire burned very
      bright, and leaped up high, as though it wanted men to warm; but would it
      have been less tempting, looked at from the clammy cushions of a gig? The
      wind blew keenly, nipping the features of the hardy wight who fought his
      way along; blinding him with his own hair if he had enough to it, and
      wintry dust if he hadn&rsquo;t; stopping his breath as though he had been soused
      in a cold bath; tearing aside his wrappings-up, and whistling in the very
      marrow of his bones; but it would have done all this a hundred times more
      fiercely to a man in a gig, wouldn&rsquo;t it? A fig for gigs!
    </p>
    <p>
      Better than the gig! When were travellers by wheels and hoofs seen with
      such red-hot cheeks as those? when were they so good-humouredly and
      merrily bloused? when did their laughter ring upon the air, as they turned
      them round, what time the stronger gusts came sweeping up; and, facing
      round again as they passed by, dashed on, in such a glow of ruddy health
      as nothing could keep pace with, but the high spirits it engendered?
      Better than the gig! Why, here is a man in a gig coming the same way now.
      Look at him as he passes his whip into his left hand, chafes his numbed
      right fingers on his granite leg, and beats those marble toes of his upon
      the foot-board. Ha, ha, ha! Who would exchange this rapid hurry of the
      blood for yonder stagnant misery, though its pace were twenty miles for
      one?
    </p>
    <p>
      Better than the gig! No man in a gig could have such interest in the
      milestones. No man in a gig could see, or feel, or think, like merry users
      of their legs. How, as the wind sweeps on, upon these breezy downs, it
      tracks its flight in darkening ripples on the grass, and smoothest shadows
      on the hills! Look round and round upon this bare bleak plain, and see
      even here, upon a winter&rsquo;s day, how beautiful the shadows are! Alas! it is
      the nature of their kind to be so. The loveliest things in life, Tom, are
      but shadows; and they come and go, and change and fade away, as rapidly as
      these!
    </p>
    <p>
      Another mile, and then begins a fall of snow, making the crow, who skims
      away so close above the ground to shirk the wind, a blot of ink upon the
      landscape. But though it drives and drifts against them as they walk,
      stiffening on their skirts, and freezing in the lashes of their eyes, they
      wouldn&rsquo;t have it fall more sparingly, no, not so much as by a single
      flake, although they had to go a score of miles. And, lo! the towers of
      the Old Cathedral rise before them, even now! and by-and-bye they come
      into the sheltered streets, made strangely silent by their white carpet;
      and so to the Inn for which they are bound; where they present such
      flushed and burning faces to the cold waiter, and are so brimful of
      vigour, that he almost feels assaulted by their presence; and, having
      nothing to oppose to the attack (being fresh, or rather stale, from the
      blazing fire in the coffee-room), is quite put out of his pale
      countenance.
    </p>
    <p>
      A famous Inn! the hall a very grove of dead game, and dangling joints of
      mutton; and in one corner an illustrious larder, with glass doors,
      developing cold fowls and noble joints, and tarts wherein the raspberry
      jam coyly withdrew itself, as such a precious creature should, behind a
      lattice work of pastry. And behold, on the first floor, at the court-end
      of the house, in a room with all the window-curtains drawn, a fire piled
      half-way up the chimney, plates warming before it, wax candles gleaming
      everywhere, and a table spread for three, with silver and glass enough for
      thirty&mdash;John Westlock; not the old John of Pecksniff&rsquo;s, but a proper
      gentleman; looking another and a grander person, with the consciousness of
      being his own master and having money in the bank; and yet in some
      respects the old John too, for he seized Tom Pinch by both his hands the
      instant he appeared, and fairly hugged him, in his cordial welcome.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;And this,&rsquo; said John, &lsquo;is Mr Chuzzlewit. I am very glad to see him!&rsquo;&mdash;John
      had an off-hand manner of his own; so they shook hands warmly, and were
      friends in no time.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Stand off a moment, Tom,&rsquo; cried the old pupil, laying one hand on each of
      Mr Pinch&rsquo;s shoulders, and holding him out at arm&rsquo;s length. &lsquo;Let me look at
      you! Just the same! Not a bit changed!&rsquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Why, it&rsquo;s not so very long ago, you know,&rsquo; said Tom Pinch, &lsquo;after all.&rsquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;It seems an age to me,&rsquo; cried John, &lsquo;and so it ought to seem to you, you
      dog.&rsquo; And then he pushed Tom down into the easiest chair, and clapped him
      on the back so heartily, and so like his old self in their old bedroom at
      old Pecksniff&rsquo;s that it was a toss-up with Tom Pinch whether he should
      laugh or cry. Laughter won it; and they all three laughed together.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;I have ordered everything for dinner, that we used to say we&rsquo;d have,
      Tom,&rsquo; observed John Westlock.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;No!&rsquo; said Tom Pinch. &lsquo;Have you?&rsquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Everything. Don&rsquo;t laugh, if you can help it, before the waiters. I
      couldn&rsquo;t when I was ordering it. It&rsquo;s like a dream.&rsquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      John was wrong there, because nobody ever dreamed such soup as was put
      upon the table directly afterwards; or such fish; or such side-dishes; or
      such a top and bottom; or such a course of birds and sweets; or in short
      anything approaching the reality of that entertainment at ten-and-sixpence
      a head, exclusive of wines. As to <i>them</i>, the man who can dream such iced
      champagne, such claret, port, or sherry, had better go to bed and stop
      there.
    </p>
    <p>
      But perhaps the finest feature of the banquet was, that nobody was half so
      much amazed by everything as John himself, who in his high delight was
      constantly bursting into fits of laughter, and then endeavouring to appear
      preternaturally solemn, lest the waiters should conceive he wasn&rsquo;t used to
      it. Some of the things they brought him to carve, were such outrageous
      practical jokes, though, that it was impossible to stand it; and when Tom
      Pinch insisted, in spite of the deferential advice of an attendant, not
      only on breaking down the outer wall of a raised pie with a tablespoon,
      but on trying to eat it afterwards, John lost all dignity, and sat behind
      the gorgeous dish-cover at the head of the table, roaring to that extent
      that he was audible in the kitchen. Nor had he the least objection to
      laugh at himself, as he demonstrated when they had all three gathered
      round the fire and the dessert was on the table; at which period the head
      waiter inquired with respectful solicitude whether that port, being a
      light and tawny wine, was suited to his taste, or whether he would wish to
      try a fruity port with greater body. To this John gravely answered that he
      was well satisfied with what he had, which he esteemed, as one might say,
      a pretty tidy vintage; for which the waiter thanked him and withdrew. And
      then John told his friends, with a broad grin, that he supposed it was all
      right, but he didn&rsquo;t know; and went off into a perfect shout.
    </p>
    <p>
      They were very merry and full of enjoyment the whole time, but not the
      least pleasant part of the festival was when they all three sat about the
      fire, cracking nuts, drinking wine and talking cheerfully. It happened
      that Tom Pinch had a word to say to his friend the organist&rsquo;s assistant,
      and so deserted his warm corner for a few minutes at this season, lest it
      should grow too late; leaving the other two young men together.
    </p>
    <p>
      They drank his health in his absence, of course; and John Westlock took
      that opportunity of saying, that he had never had even a peevish word with
      Tom during the whole term of their residence in Mr Pecksniff&rsquo;s house. This
      naturally led him to dwell upon Tom&rsquo;s character, and to hint that Mr
      Pecksniff understood it pretty well. He only hinted this, and very
      distantly; knowing that it pained Tom Pinch to have that gentleman
      disparaged, and thinking it would be as well to leave the new pupil to his
      own discoveries.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Yes,&rsquo; said Martin. &lsquo;It&rsquo;s impossible to like Pinch better than I do, or to
      do greater justice to his good qualities. He is the most willing fellow I
      ever saw.&rsquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;He&rsquo;s rather too willing,&rsquo; observed John, who was quick in observation.
      &lsquo;It&rsquo;s quite a fault in him.&rsquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;So it is,&rsquo; said Martin. &lsquo;Very true. There was a fellow only a week or so
      ago&mdash;a Mr Tigg&mdash;who borrowed all the money he had, on a promise
      to repay it in a few days. It was but half a sovereign, to be sure; but
      it&rsquo;s well it was no more, for he&rsquo;ll never see it again.&rsquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Poor fellow!&rsquo; said John, who had been very attentive to these few words.
      &lsquo;Perhaps you have not had an opportunity of observing that, in his own
      pecuniary transactions, Tom&rsquo;s proud.&rsquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;You don&rsquo;t say so! No, I haven&rsquo;t. What do you mean? Won&rsquo;t he borrow?&rsquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      John Westlock shook his head.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;That&rsquo;s very odd,&rsquo; said Martin, setting down his empty glass. &lsquo;He&rsquo;s a
      strange compound, to be sure.&rsquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;As to receiving money as a gift,&rsquo; resumed John Westlock; &lsquo;I think he&rsquo;d
      die first.&rsquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;He&rsquo;s made up of simplicity,&rsquo; said Martin. &lsquo;Help yourself.&rsquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;You, however,&rsquo; pursued John, filling his own glass, and looking at his
      companion with some curiosity, &lsquo;who are older than the majority of Mr
      Pecksniff&rsquo;s assistants, and have evidently had much more experience,
      understand him, I have no doubt, and see how liable he is to be imposed
      upon.&rsquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Certainly,&rsquo; said Martin, stretching out his legs, and holding his wine
      between his eye and the light. &lsquo;Mr Pecksniff knows that too. So do his
      daughters. Eh?&rsquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      John Westlock smiled, but made no answer.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;By the bye,&rsquo; said Martin, &lsquo;that reminds me. What&rsquo;s your opinion of
      Pecksniff? How did he use you? What do you think of him now?&mdash;Coolly,
      you know, when it&rsquo;s all over?&rsquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Ask Pinch,&rsquo; returned the old pupil. &lsquo;He knows what my sentiments used to
      be upon the subject. They are not changed, I assure you.&rsquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;No, no,&rsquo; said Martin, &lsquo;I&rsquo;d rather have them from you.&rsquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;But Pinch says they are unjust,&rsquo; urged John with a smile.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Oh! well! Then I know what course they take beforehand,&rsquo; said Martin;
      &lsquo;and, therefore, you can have no delicacy in speaking plainly. Don&rsquo;t mind
      me, I beg. I don&rsquo;t like him I tell you frankly. I am with him because it
      happens from particular circumstances to suit my convenience. I have some
      ability, I believe, in that way; and the obligation, if any, will most
      likely be on his side and not mine. At the lowest mark, the balance will
      be even, and there&rsquo;ll be no obligation at all. So you may talk to me, as
      if I had no connection with him.&rsquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;If you press me to give my opinion&mdash;&rsquo; returned John Westlock.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Yes, I do,&rsquo; said Martin. &lsquo;You&rsquo;ll oblige me.&rsquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;&mdash;I should say,&rsquo; resumed the other, &lsquo;that he is the most consummate
      scoundrel on the face of the earth.&rsquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Oh!&rsquo; said Martin, as coolly as ever. &lsquo;That&rsquo;s rather strong.&rsquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Not stronger than he deserves,&rsquo; said John; &lsquo;and if he called upon me to
      express my opinion of him to his face, I would do so in the very same
      terms, without the least qualification. His treatment of Pinch is in
      itself enough to justify them; but when I look back upon the five years I
      passed in that house, and remember the hyprocrisy, the knavery, the
      meannesses, the false pretences, the lip service of that fellow, and his
      trading in saintly semblances for the very worst realities; when I
      remember how often I was the witness of all this and how often I was made
      a kind of party to it, by the fact of being there, with him for my
      teacher; I swear to you that I almost despise myself.&rsquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      Martin drained his glass, and looked at the fire.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;I don&rsquo;t mean to say that is a right feeling,&rsquo; pursued John Westlock
      &lsquo;because it was no fault of mine; and I can quite understand&mdash;you for
      instance, fully appreciating him, and yet being forced by circumstances to
      remain there. I tell you simply what my feeling is; and even now, when, as
      you say, it&rsquo;s all over; and when I have the satisfaction of knowing that
      he always hated me, and we always quarrelled, and I always told him my
      mind; even now, I feel sorry that I didn&rsquo;t yield to an impulse I often
      had, as a boy, of running away from him and going abroad.&rsquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Why abroad?&rsquo; asked Martin, turning his eyes upon the speaker.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;In search,&rsquo; replied John Westlock, shrugging his shoulders, &lsquo;of the
      livelihood I couldn&rsquo;t have earned at home. There would have been something
      spirited in that. But, come! Fill your glass, and let us forget him.&rsquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;As soon as you please,&rsquo; said Martin. &lsquo;In reference to myself and my
      connection with him, I have only to repeat what I said before. I have
      taken my own way with him so far, and shall continue to do so, even more
      than ever; for the fact is, to tell you the truth, that I believe he looks
      to me to supply his defects, and couldn&rsquo;t afford to lose me. I had a
      notion of that in first going there. Your health!&rsquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Thank you,&rsquo; returned young Westlock. &lsquo;Yours. And may the new pupil turn
      out as well as you can desire!&rsquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;What new pupil?&rsquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;The fortunate youth, born under an auspicious star,&rsquo; returned John
      Westlock, laughing; &lsquo;whose parents, or guardians, are destined to be
      hooked by the advertisement. What! Don&rsquo;t you know that he has advertised
      again?&rsquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;No.&rsquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Oh, yes. I read it just before dinner in the old newspaper. I know it to
      be his; having some reason to remember the style. Hush! Here&rsquo;s Pinch.
      Strange, is it not, that the more he likes Pecksniff (if he can like him
      better than he does), the greater reason one has to like <i>him? </i>Not a word
      more, or we shall spoil his whole enjoyment.&rsquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      Tom entered as the words were spoken, with a radiant smile upon his face;
      and rubbing his hands, more from a sense of delight than because he was
      cold (for he had been running fast), sat down in his warm corner again,
      and was as happy as only Tom Pinch could be. There is no other simile that
      will express his state of mind.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;And so,&rsquo; he said, when he had gazed at his friend for some time in silent
      pleasure, &lsquo;so you really are a gentleman at last, John. Well, to be sure!&rsquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Trying to be, Tom; trying to be,&rsquo; he rejoined good-humouredly. &lsquo;There is
      no saying what I may turn out, in time.&rsquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;I suppose you wouldn&rsquo;t carry your own box to the mail now?&rsquo; said Tom
      Pinch, smiling; &lsquo;although you lost it altogether by not taking it.&rsquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Wouldn&rsquo;t I?&rsquo; retorted John. &lsquo;That&rsquo;s all you know about it, Pinch. It must
      be a very heavy box that I wouldn&rsquo;t carry to get away from Pecksniff&rsquo;s,
      Tom.&rsquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;There!&rsquo; cried Pinch, turning to Martin, &lsquo;I told you so. The great fault
      in his character is his injustice to Pecksniff. You mustn&rsquo;t mind a word he
      says on that subject. His prejudice is most extraordinary.&rsquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;The absence of anything like prejudice on Tom&rsquo;s part, you know,&rsquo; said
      John Westlock, laughing heartily, as he laid his hand on Mr Pinch&rsquo;s
      shoulder, &lsquo;is perfectly wonderful. If one man ever had a profound
      knowledge of another, and saw him in a true light, and in his own proper
      colours, Tom has that knowledge of Mr Pecksniff.&rsquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Why, of course I have,&rsquo; cried Tom. &lsquo;That&rsquo;s exactly what I have so often
      said to you. If you knew him as well as I do&mdash;John, I&rsquo;d give almost
      any money to bring that about&mdash;you&rsquo;d admire, respect, and reverence
      him. You couldn&rsquo;t help it. Oh, how you wounded his feelings when you went
      away!&rsquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;If I had known whereabout his feelings lay,&rsquo; retorted young Westlock,
      &lsquo;I&rsquo;d have done my best, Tom, with that end in view, you may depend upon
      it. But as I couldn&rsquo;t wound him in what he has not, and in what he knows
      nothing of, except in his ability to probe them to the quick in other
      people, I am afraid I can lay no claim to your compliment.&rsquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      Mr Pinch, being unwilling to protract a discussion which might possibly
      corrupt Martin, forbore to say anything in reply to this speech; but John
      Westlock, whom nothing short of an iron gag would have silenced when Mr
      Pecksniff&rsquo;s merits were once in question, continued notwithstanding.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;<i>His </i>feelings! Oh, he&rsquo;s a tender-hearted man. <i>His </i>feelings! Oh, he&rsquo;s a
      considerate, conscientious, self-examining, moral vagabond, he is! <i>His</i>
      feelings! Oh!&mdash;what&rsquo;s the matter, Tom?&rsquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      Mr Pinch was by this time erect upon the hearth-rug, buttoning his coat
      with great energy.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;I can&rsquo;t bear it,&rsquo; said Tom, shaking his head. &lsquo;No. I really cannot. You
      must excuse me, John. I have a great esteem and friendship for you; I love
      you very much; and have been perfectly charmed and overjoyed to-day, to
      find you just the same as ever; but I cannot listen to this.&rsquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Why, it&rsquo;s my old way, Tom; and you say yourself that you are glad to find
      me unchanged.&rsquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Not in this respect,&rsquo; said Tom Pinch. &lsquo;You must excuse me, John. I
      cannot, really; I will not. It&rsquo;s very wrong; you should be more guarded in
      your expressions. It was bad enough when you and I used to be alone
      together, but under existing circumstances, I can&rsquo;t endure it, really. No.
      I cannot, indeed.&rsquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;You are quite right!&rsquo; exclaimed the other, exchanging looks with Martin.
      &lsquo;and I am quite wrong, Tom, I don&rsquo;t know how the deuce we fell on this
      unlucky theme. I beg your pardon with all my heart.&rsquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;You have a free and manly temper, I know,&rsquo; said Pinch; &lsquo;and therefore,
      your being so ungenerous in this one solitary instance, only grieves me
      the more. It&rsquo;s not my pardon you have to ask, John. You have done <i>me</i>
      nothing but kindnesses.&rsquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Well! Pecksniff&rsquo;s pardon then,&rsquo; said young Westlock. &lsquo;Anything Tom, or
      anybody. Pecksniff&rsquo;s pardon&mdash;will that do? Here! let us drink
      Pecksniff&rsquo;s health!&rsquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Thank you,&rsquo; cried Tom, shaking hands with him eagerly, and filling a
      bumper. &lsquo;Thank you; I&rsquo;ll drink it with all my heart, John. Mr Pecksniff&rsquo;s
      health, and prosperity to him!&rsquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      John Westlock echoed the sentiment, or nearly so; for he drank Mr
      Pecksniff&rsquo;s health, and Something to him&mdash;but what, was not quite
      audible. The general unanimity being then completely restored, they drew
      their chairs closer round the fire, and conversed in perfect harmony and
      enjoyment until bed-time.
    </p>
    <p>
      No slight circumstance, perhaps, could have better illustrated the
      difference of character between John Westlock and Martin Chuzzlewit, than
      the manner in which each of the young men contemplated Tom Pinch, after
      the little rupture just described. There was a certain amount of
      jocularity in the looks of both, no doubt, but there all resemblance
      ceased. The old pupil could not do enough to show Tom how cordially he
      felt towards him, and his friendly regard seemed of a graver and more
      thoughtful kind than before. The new one, on the other hand, had no
      impulse but to laugh at the recollection of Tom&rsquo;s extreme absurdity; and
      mingled with his amusement there was something slighting and contemptuous,
      indicative, as it appeared, of his opinion that Mr Pinch was much too far
      gone in simplicity to be admitted as the friend, on serious and equal
      terms, of any rational man.
    </p>
    <p>
      John Westlock, who did nothing by halves, if he could help it, had
      provided beds for his two guests in the hotel; and after a very happy
      evening, they retired. Mr Pinch was sitting on the side of his bed with
      his cravat and shoes off, ruminating on the manifold good qualities of his
      old friend, when he was interrupted by a knock at his chamber door, and
      the voice of John himself.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;You&rsquo;re not asleep yet, are you, Tom?&rsquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Bless you, no! not I. I was thinking of you,&rsquo; replied Tom, opening the
      door. &lsquo;Come in.&rsquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;I am not going to detail you,&rsquo; said John; &lsquo;but I have forgotten all the
      evening a little commission I took upon myself; and I am afraid I may
      forget it again, if I fail to discharge it at once. You know a Mr Tigg,
      Tom, I believe?&rsquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Tigg!&rsquo; cried Tom. &lsquo;Tigg! The gentleman who borrowed some money of me?&rsquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Exactly,&rsquo; said John Westlock. &lsquo;He begged me to present his compliments,
      and to return it with many thanks. Here it is. I suppose it&rsquo;s a good one,
      but he is rather a doubtful kind of customer, Tom.&rsquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      Mr Pinch received the little piece of gold with a face whose brightness
      might have shamed the metal; and said he had no fear about that. He was
      glad, he added, to find Mr Tigg so prompt and honourable in his dealings;
      very glad.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Why, to tell you the truth, Tom,&rsquo; replied his friend, &lsquo;he is not always
      so. If you&rsquo;ll take my advice, you&rsquo;ll avoid him as much as you can, in the
      event of your encountering him again. And by no means, Tom&mdash;pray bear
      this in mind, for I am very serious&mdash;by no means lend him money any
      more.&rsquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Aye, aye!&rsquo; said Tom, with his eyes wide open.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;He is very far from being a reputable acquaintance,&rsquo; returned young
      Westlock; &lsquo;and the more you let him know you think so, the better for you,
      Tom.&rsquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;I say, John,&rsquo; quoth Mr Pinch, as his countenance fell, and he shook his
      head in a dejected manner. &lsquo;I hope you are not getting into bad company.&rsquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;No, no,&rsquo; he replied laughing. &lsquo;Don&rsquo;t be uneasy on that score.&rsquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Oh, but I <i>am</i> uneasy,&rsquo; said Tom Pinch; &lsquo;I can&rsquo;t help it, when I hear you
      talking in that way. If Mr Tigg is what you describe him to be, you have
      no business to know him, John. You may laugh, but I don&rsquo;t consider it by
      any means a laughing matter, I assure you.&rsquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;No, no,&rsquo; returned his friend, composing his features. &lsquo;Quite right. It is
      not, certainly.&rsquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;You know, John,&rsquo; said Mr Pinch, &lsquo;your very good nature and kindness of
      heart make you thoughtless, and you can&rsquo;t be too careful on such a point
      as this. Upon my word, if I thought you were falling among bad companions,
      I should be quite wretched, for I know how difficult you would find it to
      shake them off. I would much rather have lost this money, John, than I
      would have had it back again on such terms.&rsquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;I tell you, my dear good old fellow,&rsquo; cried his friend, shaking him to
      and fro with both hands, and smiling at him with a cheerful, open
      countenance, that would have carried conviction to a mind much more
      suspicious than Tom&rsquo;s; &lsquo;I tell you there is no danger.&rsquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Well!&rsquo; cried Tom, &lsquo;I am glad to hear it; I am overjoyed to hear it. I am
      sure there is not, when you say so in that manner. You won&rsquo;t take it ill,
      John, that I said what I did just now!&rsquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Ill!&rsquo; said the other, giving his hand a hearty squeeze; &lsquo;why what do you
      think I am made of? Mr Tigg and I are not on such an intimate footing that
      you need be at all uneasy, I give you my solemn assurance of that, Tom.
      You are quite comfortable now?&rsquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Quite,&rsquo; said Tom.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Then once more, good night!&rsquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Good night!&rsquo; cried Tom; &lsquo;and such pleasant dreams to you as should attend
      the sleep of the best fellow in the world!&rsquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;&mdash;Except Pecksniff,&rsquo; said his friend, stopping at the door for a
      moment, and looking gayly back.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Except Pecksniff,&rsquo; answered Tom, with great gravity; &lsquo;of course.&rsquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      And thus they parted for the night; John Westlock full of
      light-heartedness and good humour, and poor Tom Pinch quite satisfied;
      though still, as he turned over on his side in bed, he muttered to
      himself, &lsquo;I really do wish, for all that, though, that he wasn&rsquo;t
      acquainted with Mr Tigg.&rsquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      They breakfasted together very early next morning, for the two young men
      desired to get back again in good season; and John Westlock was to return
      to London by the coach that day. As he had some hours to spare, he bore
      them company for three or four miles on their walk, and only parted from
      them at last in sheer necessity. The parting was an unusually hearty one,
      not only as between him and Tom Pinch, but on the side of Martin also, who
      had found in the old pupil a very different sort of person from the
      milksop he had prepared himself to expect.
    </p>
    <p>
      Young Westlock stopped upon a rising ground, when he had gone a little
      distance, and looked back. They were walking at a brisk pace, and Tom
      appeared to be talking earnestly. Martin had taken off his greatcoat, the
      wind being now behind them, and carried it upon his arm. As he looked, he
      saw Tom relieve him of it, after a faint resistance, and, throwing it upon
      his own, encumber himself with the weight of both. This trivial incident
      impressed the old pupil mightily, for he stood there, gazing after them,
      until they were hidden from his view; when he shook his head, as if he
      were troubled by some uneasy reflection, and thoughtfully retraced his
      steps to Salisbury.
    </p>
    <p>
      In the meantime, Martin and Tom pursued their way, until they halted, safe
      and sound, at Mr Pecksniff&rsquo;s house, where a brief epistle from that good
      gentleman to Mr Pinch announced the family&rsquo;s return by that night&rsquo;s coach.
      As it would pass the corner of the lane at about six o&rsquo;clock in the
      morning, Mr Pecksniff requested that the gig might be in waiting at the
      finger-post about that time, together with a cart for the luggage. And to
      the end that he might be received with the greater honour, the young men
      agreed to rise early, and be upon the spot themselves.
    </p>
    <p>
      It was the least cheerful day they had yet passed together. Martin was out
      of spirits and out of humour, and took every opportunity of comparing his
      condition and prospects with those of young Westlock; much to his own
      disadvantage always. This mood of his depressed Tom; and neither that
      morning&rsquo;s parting, nor yesterday&rsquo;s dinner, helped to mend the matter. So
      the hours dragged on heavily enough; and they were glad to go to bed
      early.
    </p>
    <p>
      They were not quite so glad to get up again at half-past four o&rsquo;clock, in
      all the shivering discomfort of a dark winter&rsquo;s morning; but they turned
      out punctually, and were at the finger-post full half-an-hour before the
      appointed time. It was not by any means a lively morning, for the sky was
      black and cloudy, and it rained hard; but Martin said there was some
      satisfaction in seeing that brute of a horse (by this, he meant Mr
      Pecksniff&rsquo;s Arab steed) getting very wet; and that he rejoiced, on his
      account, that it rained so fast. From this it may be inferred that
      Martin&rsquo;s spirits had not improved, as indeed they had not; for while he
      and Mr Pinch stood waiting under a hedge, looking at the rain, the gig,
      the cart, and its reeking driver, he did nothing but grumble; and, but
      that it is indispensable to any dispute that there should be two parties
      to it, he would certainly have picked a quarrel with Tom.
    </p>
    <p>
      At length the noise of wheels was faintly audible in the distance and
      presently the coach came splashing through the mud and mire with one
      miserable outside passenger crouching down among wet straw, under a
      saturated umbrella; and the coachman, guard, and horses, in a fellowship
      of dripping wretchedness. Immediately on its stopping, Mr Pecksniff let
      down the window-glass and hailed Tom Pinch.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Dear me, Mr Pinch! Is it possible that you are out upon this very
      inclement morning?&rsquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Yes, sir,&rsquo; cried Tom, advancing eagerly, &lsquo;Mr Chuzzlewit and I, sir.&rsquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Oh!&rsquo; said Mr Pecksniff, looking not so much at Martin as at the spot on
      which he stood. &lsquo;Oh! Indeed. Do me the favour to see to the trunks, if you
      please, Mr Pinch.&rsquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      Then Mr Pecksniff descended, and helped his daughters to alight; but
      neither he nor the young ladies took the slightest notice of Martin, who
      had advanced to offer his assistance, but was repulsed by Mr Pecksniff&rsquo;s
      standing immediately before his person, with his back towards him. In the
      same manner, and in profound silence, Mr Pecksniff handed his daughters
      into the gig; and following himself and taking the reins, drove off home.
    </p>
    <p>
      Lost in astonishment, Martin stood staring at the coach, and when the
      coach had driven away, at Mr Pinch, and the luggage, until the cart moved
      off too; when he said to Tom:
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Now will you have the goodness to tell me what <i>this </i>portends?&rsquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;What?&rsquo; asked Tom.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;This fellow&rsquo;s behaviour. Mr Pecksniff&rsquo;s, I mean. You saw it?&rsquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;No. Indeed I did not,&rsquo; cried Tom. &lsquo;I was busy with the trunks.&rsquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;It is no matter,&rsquo; said Martin. &lsquo;Come! Let us make haste back!&rsquo; And
      without another word started off at such a pace, that Tom had some
      difficulty in keeping up with him.
    </p>
    <p>
      He had no care where he went, but walked through little heaps of mud and
      little pools of water with the utmost indifference; looking straight
      before him, and sometimes laughing in a strange manner within himself. Tom
      felt that anything he could say would only render him the more obstinate,
      and therefore trusted to Mr Pecksniff&rsquo;s manner when they reached the
      house, to remove the mistaken impression under which he felt convinced so
      great a favourite as the new pupil must unquestionably be labouring. But
      he was not a little amazed himself, when they did reach it, and entered
      the parlour where Mr Pecksniff was sitting alone before the fire, drinking
      some hot tea, to find that instead of taking favourable notice of his
      relative and keeping him, Mr Pinch, in the background, he did exactly the
      reverse, and was so lavish in his attentions to Tom, that Tom was
      thoroughly confounded.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Take some tea, Mr Pinch&mdash;take some tea,&rsquo; said Pecksniff, stirring
      the fire. &lsquo;You must be very cold and damp. Pray take some tea, and come
      into a warm place, Mr Pinch.&rsquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      Tom saw that Martin looked at Mr Pecksniff as though he could have easily
      found it in his heart to give <i>him </i>an invitation to a very warm place; but
      he was quite silent, and standing opposite that gentleman at the table,
      regarded him attentively.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Take a chair, Pinch,&rsquo; said Pecksniff. &lsquo;Take a chair, if you please. How
      have things gone on in our absence, Mr Pinch?&rsquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;You&mdash;you will be very much pleased with the grammar-school, sir,&rsquo;
      said Tom. &lsquo;It&rsquo;s nearly finished.&rsquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;If you will have the goodness, Mr Pinch,&rsquo; said Pecksniff, waving his hand
      and smiling, &lsquo;we will not discuss anything connected with that question at
      present. What have <i>you </i>been doing, Thomas, humph?&rsquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      Mr Pinch looked from master to pupil, and from pupil to master, and was so
      perplexed and dismayed that he wanted presence of mind to answer the
      question. In this awkward interval, Mr Pecksniff (who was perfectly
      conscious of Martin&rsquo;s gaze, though he had never once glanced towards him)
      poked the fire very much, and when he couldn&rsquo;t do that any more, drank tea
      assiduously.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Now, Mr Pecksniff,&rsquo; said Martin at last, in a very quiet voice, &lsquo;if you
      have sufficiently refreshed and recovered yourself, I shall be glad to
      hear what you mean by this treatment of me.&rsquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;And what,&rsquo; said Mr Pecksniff, turning his eyes on Tom Pinch, even more
      placidly and gently than before, &lsquo;what have <i>you </i>been doing, Thomas,
      humph?&rsquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      When he had repeated this inquiry, he looked round the walls of the room
      as if he were curious to see whether any nails had been left there by
      accident in former times.
    </p>
    <p>
      Tom was almost at his wit&rsquo;s end what to say between the two, and had
      already made a gesture as if he would call Mr Pecksniff&rsquo;s attention to the
      gentleman who had last addressed him, when Martin saved him further
      trouble, by doing so himself.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Mr Pecksniff,&rsquo; he said, softly rapping the table twice or thrice, and
      moving a step or two nearer, so that he could have touched him with his
      hand; &lsquo;you heard what I said just now. Do me the favour to reply, if you
      please. I ask you&rsquo;&mdash;he raised his voice a little here&mdash;&lsquo;what you
      mean by this?&rsquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;I will talk to you, sir,&rsquo; said Mr Pecksniff in a severe voice, as he
      looked at him for the first time, &lsquo;presently.&rsquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;You are very obliging,&rsquo; returned Martin; &lsquo;presently will not do. I must
      trouble you to talk to me at once.&rsquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      Mr Pecksniff made a feint of being deeply interested in his pocketbook,
      but it shook in his hands; he trembled so.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Now,&rsquo; retorted Martin, rapping the table again. &lsquo;Now. Presently will not
      do. Now!&rsquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Do you threaten me, sir?&rsquo; cried Mr Pecksniff.
    </p>
    <p>
      Martin looked at him, and made no answer; but a curious observer might
      have detected an ominous twitching at his mouth, and perhaps an
      involuntary attraction of his right hand in the direction of Mr
      Pecksniff&rsquo;s cravat.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;I lament to be obliged to say, sir,&rsquo; resumed Mr Pecksniff, &lsquo;that it would
      be quite in keeping with your character if you did threaten me. You have
      deceived me. You have imposed upon a nature which you knew to be confiding
      and unsuspicious. You have obtained admission, sir,&rsquo; said Mr Pecksniff,
      rising, &lsquo;to this house, on perverted statements and on false pretences.&rsquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Go on,&rsquo; said Martin, with a scornful smile. &lsquo;I understand you now. What
      more?&rsquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Thus much more, sir,&rsquo; cried Mr Pecksniff, trembling from head to foot,
      and trying to rub his hands, as though he were only cold. &lsquo;Thus much more,
      if you force me to publish your shame before a third party, which I was
      unwilling and indisposed to do. This lowly roof, sir, must not be
      contaminated by the presence of one who has deceived, and cruelly
      deceived, an honourable, beloved, venerated, and venerable gentleman; and
      who wisely suppressed that deceit from me when he sought my protection and
      favour, knowing that, humble as I am, I am an honest man, seeking to do my
      duty in this carnal universe, and setting my face against all vice and
      treachery. I weep for your depravity, sir,&rsquo; said Mr Pecksniff; &lsquo;I mourn
      over your corruption, I pity your voluntary withdrawal of yourself from
      the flowery paths of purity and peace;&rsquo; here he struck himself upon his
      breast, or moral garden; &lsquo;but I cannot have a leper and a serpent for an
      inmate. Go forth,&rsquo; said Mr Pecksniff, stretching out his hand: &lsquo;go forth,
      young man! Like all who know you, I renounce you!&rsquo;
    </p>
<div class="fig" style="width:65%">

    <h5>
      <a href="images/20246.jpg"><i>Original</i></a>
    </h5>
    <p>
      With what intention Martin made a stride forward at these words, it is
      impossible to say. It is enough to know that Tom Pinch caught him in his
      arms, and that, at the same moment, Mr Pecksniff stepped back so hastily,
      that he missed his footing, tumbled over a chair, and fell in a sitting
      posture on the ground; where he remained without an effort to get up
      again, with his head in a corner, perhaps considering it the safest place.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Let me go, Pinch!&rsquo; cried Martin, shaking him away. &lsquo;Why do you hold me?
      Do you think a blow could make him a more abject creature than he is? Do
      you think that if I spat upon him, I could degrade him to a lower level
      than his own? Look at him. Look at him, Pinch!&rsquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      Mr Pinch involuntarily did so. Mr Pecksniff sitting, as has been already
      mentioned, on the carpet, with his head in an acute angle of the wainscot,
      and all the damage and detriment of an uncomfortable journey about him,
      was not exactly a model of all that is prepossessing and dignified in man,
      certainly. Still he <i>was </i>Pecksniff; it was impossible to deprive him of
      that unique and paramount appeal to Tom. And he returned Tom&rsquo;s glance, as
      if he would have said, &lsquo;Aye, Mr Pinch, look at me! Here I am! You know
      what the Poet says about an honest man; and an honest man is one of the
      few great works that can be seen for nothing! Look at me!&rsquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;I tell you,&rsquo; said Martin, &lsquo;that as he lies there, disgraced, bought,
      used; a cloth for dirty hands, a mat for dirty feet, a lying, fawning,
      servile hound, he is the very last and worst among the vermin of the
      world. And mark me, Pinch! The day will come&mdash;he knows it; see it
      written on his face, while I speak!&mdash;when even you will find him out,
      and will know him as I do, and as he knows I do. <i>he</i> renounce <i>me</i>! Cast your
      eyes on the Renouncer, Pinch, and be the wiser for the recollection!&rsquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      He pointed at him as he spoke, with unutterable contempt, and flinging his
      hat upon his head, walked from the room and from the house. He went so
      rapidly that he was already clear of the village, when he heard Tom Pinch
      calling breathlessly after him in the distance.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Well! what now?&rsquo; he said, when Tom came up.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Dear, dear!&rsquo; cried Tom, &lsquo;are you going?&rsquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Going!&rsquo; he echoed. &lsquo;Going!&rsquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;I didn&rsquo;t so much mean that, as were you going now at once&mdash;in this
      bad weather&mdash;on foot&mdash;without your clothes&mdash;with no money?&rsquo;
      cried Tom.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Yes,&rsquo; he answered sternly, &lsquo;I am.&rsquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;And where?&rsquo; cried Tom. &lsquo;Oh where will you go?&rsquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;I don&rsquo;t know,&rsquo; he said. &lsquo;Yes, I do. I&rsquo;ll go to America!&rsquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;No, no,&rsquo; cried Tom, in a kind of agony. &lsquo;Don&rsquo;t go there. Pray don&rsquo;t.
      Think better of it. Don&rsquo;t be so dreadfully regardless of yourself. Don&rsquo;t
      go to America!&rsquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;My mind is made up,&rsquo; he said. &lsquo;Your friend was right. I&rsquo;ll go to America.
      God bless you, Pinch!&rsquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Take this!&rsquo; cried Tom, pressing a book upon him in great agitation. &lsquo;I
      must make haste back, and can&rsquo;t say anything I would. Heaven be with you.
      Look at the leaf I have turned down. Good-bye, good-bye!&rsquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      The simple fellow wrung him by the hand, with tears stealing down his
      cheeks; and they parted hurriedly upon their separate ways.

      CHAPTER THIRTEEN
    </h2>
    <p>
      SHOWING WHAT BECAME OF MARTIN AND HIS DESPARATE RESOLVE, AFTER HE LEFT MR
      PECKSNIFF&rsquo;S HOUSE; WHAT PERSONS HE ENCOUNTERED; WHAT ANXIETIES HE
      SUFFERED; AND WHAT NEWS HE HEARD
    </p>
    <p>
      Carrying Tom Pinch&rsquo;s book quite unconsciously under his arm, and not even
      buttoning his coat as a protection against the heavy rain, Martin went
      doggedly forward at the same quick pace, until he had passed the
      finger-post, and was on the high road to London. He slackened very little
      in his speed even then, but he began to think, and look about him, and to
      disengage his senses from the coil of angry passions which hitherto had
      held them prisoner.
    </p>
    <p>
      It must be confessed that, at that moment, he had no very agreeable
      employment either for his moral or his physical perceptions. The day was
      dawning from a patch of watery light in the east, and sullen clouds came
      driving up before it, from which the rain descended in a thick, wet mist.
      It streamed from every twig and bramble in the hedge; made little gullies
      in the path; ran down a hundred channels in the road; and punched
      innumerable holes into the face of every pond and gutter. It fell with an
      oozy, slushy sound among the grass; and made a muddy kennel of every
      furrow in the ploughed fields. No living creature was anywhere to be seen.
      The prospect could hardly have been more desolate if animated nature had
      been dissolved in water, and poured down upon the earth again in that
      form.
    </p>
    <p>
      The range of view within the solitary traveller was quite as cheerless as
      the scene without. Friendless and penniless; incensed to the last degree;
      deeply wounded in his pride and self-love; full of independent schemes,
      and perfectly destitute of any means of realizing them; his most
      vindictive enemy might have been satisfied with the extent of his
      troubles. To add to his other miseries, he was by this time sensible of
      being wet to the skin, and cold at his very heart.
    </p>
    <p>
      In this deplorable condition he remembered Mr Pinch&rsquo;s book; more because
      it was rather troublesome to carry, than from any hope of being comforted
      by that parting gift. He looked at the dingy lettering on the back, and
      finding it to be an odd volume of the &lsquo;Bachelor of Salamanca,&rsquo; in the
      French tongue, cursed Tom Pinch&rsquo;s folly twenty times. He was on the point
      of throwing it away, in his ill-humour and vexation, when he bethought
      himself that Tom had referred him to a leaf, turned down; and opening it
      at that place, that he might have additional cause of complaint against
      him for supposing that any cold scrap of the Bachelor&rsquo;s wisdom could cheer
      him in such circumstances, found!&mdash;
    </p>
    <p>
      Well, well! not much, but Tom&rsquo;s all. The half-sovereign. He had wrapped it
      hastily in a piece of paper, and pinned it to the leaf. These words were
      scrawled in pencil on the inside: &lsquo;I don&rsquo;t want it indeed. I should not
      know what to do with it if I had it.&rsquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      There are some falsehoods, Tom, on which men mount, as on bright wings,
      towards Heaven. There are some truths, cold bitter taunting truths,
      wherein your worldly scholars are very apt and punctual, which bind men
      down to earth with leaden chains. Who would not rather have to fan him, in
      his dying hour, the lightest feather of a falsehood such as thine, than
      all the quills that have been plucked from the sharp porcupine,
      reproachful truth, since time began!
    </p>
    <p>
      Martin felt keenly for himself, and he felt this good deed of Tom&rsquo;s
      keenly. After a few minutes it had the effect of raising his spirits, and
      reminding him that he was not altogether destitute, as he had left a fair
      stock of clothes behind him, and wore a gold hunting-watch in his pocket.
      He found a curious gratification, too, in thinking what a winning fellow
      he must be to have made such an impression on Tom; and in reflecting how
      superior he was to Tom; and how much more likely to make his way in the
      world. Animated by these thoughts, and strengthened in his design of
      endeavouring to push his fortune in another country, he resolved to get to
      London as a rallying-point, in the best way he could; and to lose no time
      about it.
    </p>
    <p>
      He was ten good miles from the village made illustrious by being the
      abiding-place of Mr Pecksniff, when he stopped to breakfast at a little
      roadside alehouse; and resting upon a high-backed settle before the fire,
      pulled off his coat, and hung it before the cheerful blaze to dry. It was
      a very different place from the last tavern in which he had regaled;
      boasting no greater extent of accommodation than the brick-floored kitchen
      yielded; but the mind so soon accommodates itself to the necessities of
      the body, that this poor waggoner&rsquo;s house-of-call, which he would have
      despised yesterday, became now quite a choice hotel; while his dish of
      eggs and bacon, and his mug of beer, were not by any means the coarse fare
      he had supposed, but fully bore out the inscription on the window-shutter,
      which proclaimed those viands to be &lsquo;Good entertainment for Travellers.&rsquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      He pushed away his empty plate; and with a second mug upon the hearth
      before him, looked thoughtfully at the fire until his eyes ached. Then he
      looked at the highly-coloured scripture pieces on the walls, in little
      black frames like common shaving-glasses, and saw how the Wise Men (with a
      strong family likeness among them) worshipped in a pink manger; and how
      the Prodigal Son came home in red rags to a purple father, and already
      feasted his imagination on a sea-green calf. Then he glanced through the
      window at the falling rain, coming down aslant upon the sign-post over
      against the house, and overflowing the horse-trough; and then he looked at
      the fire again, and seemed to descry a double distant London, retreating
      among the fragments of the burning wood.
    </p>
    <p>
      He had repeated this process in just the same order, many times, as if it
      were a matter of necessity, when the sound of wheels called his attention
      to the window out of its regular turn; and there he beheld a kind of light
      van drawn by four horses, and laden, as well as he could see (for it was
      covered in), with corn and straw. The driver, who was alone, stopped at
      the door to water his team, and presently came stamping and shaking the
      wet off his hat and coat, into the room where Martin sat.
    </p>
    <p>
      He was a red-faced burly young fellow; smart in his way, and with a
      good-humoured countenance. As he advanced towards the fire he touched his
      shining forehead with the forefinger of his stiff leather glove, by way of
      salutation; and said (rather unnecessarily) that it was an uncommon wet
      day.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Very wet,&rsquo; said Martin.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;I don&rsquo;t know as ever I see a wetter.&rsquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;I never felt one,&rsquo; said Martin.
    </p>
    <p>
      The driver glanced at Martin&rsquo;s soiled dress, and his damp shirt-sleeves,
      and his coat hung up to dry; and said, after a pause, as he warmed his
      hands:
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;You have been caught in it, sir?&rsquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Yes,&rsquo; was the short reply.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Out riding, maybe?&rsquo; said the driver
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;I should have been, if I owned a horse; but I don&rsquo;t,&rsquo; returned Martin.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;That&rsquo;s bad,&rsquo; said the driver.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;And may be worse,&rsquo; said Martin.
    </p>
    <p>
      Now the driver said &lsquo;That&rsquo;s bad,&rsquo; not so much because Martin didn&rsquo;t own a
      horse, as because he said he didn&rsquo;t with all the reckless desperation of
      his mood and circumstances, and so left a great deal to be inferred.
      Martin put his hands in his pockets and whistled when he had retorted on
      the driver; thus giving him to understand that he didn&rsquo;t care a pin for
      Fortune; that he was above pretending to be her favourite when he was not;
      and that he snapped his fingers at her, the driver, and everybody else.
    </p>
    <p>
      The driver looked at him stealthily for a minute or so; and in the pauses
      of his warming whistled too. At length he asked, as he pointed his thumb
      towards the road.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Up or down?&rsquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Which <i>is</i> up?&rsquo; said Martin.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;London, of course,&rsquo; said the driver.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Up then,&rsquo; said Martin. He tossed his head in a careless manner
      afterwards, as if he would have added, &lsquo;Now you know all about it.&rsquo; put
      his hands deeper into his pockets; changed his tune, and whistled a little
      louder.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;I&rsquo;m going up,&rsquo; observed the driver; &lsquo;Hounslow, ten miles this side
      London.&rsquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Are you?&rsquo; cried Martin, stopping short and looking at him.
    </p>
    <p>
      The driver sprinkled the fire with his wet hat until it hissed again and
      answered, &lsquo;Aye, to be sure he was.&rsquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Why, then,&rsquo; said Martin, &lsquo;I&rsquo;ll be plain with you. You may suppose from my
      dress that I have money to spare. I have not. All I can afford for
      coach-hire is a crown, for I have but two. If you can take me for that,
      and my waistcoat, or this silk handkerchief, do. If you can&rsquo;t, leave it
      alone.&rsquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Short and sweet,&rsquo; remarked the driver.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;You want more?&rsquo; said Martin. &lsquo;Then I haven&rsquo;t got more, and I can&rsquo;t get
      it, so there&rsquo;s an end of that.&rsquo; Whereupon he began to whistle again.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;I didn&rsquo;t say I wanted more, did I?&rsquo; asked the driver, with something like
      indignation.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;You didn&rsquo;t say my offer was enough,&rsquo; rejoined Martin.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Why, how could I, when you wouldn&rsquo;t let me? In regard to the waistcoat, I
      wouldn&rsquo;t have a man&rsquo;s waistcoat, much less a gentleman&rsquo;s waistcoat, on my
      mind, for no consideration; but the silk handkerchief&rsquo;s another thing; and
      if you was satisfied when we got to Hounslow, I shouldn&rsquo;t object to that
      as a gift.&rsquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Is it a bargain, then?&rsquo; said Martin.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Yes, it is,&rsquo; returned the other.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Then finish this beer,&rsquo; said Martin, handing him the mug, and pulling on
      his coat with great alacrity; &lsquo;and let us be off as soon as you like.&rsquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      In two minutes more he had paid his bill, which amounted to a shilling;
      was lying at full length on a truss of straw, high and dry at the top of
      the van, with the tilt a little open in front for the convenience of
      talking to his new friend; and was moving along in the right direction
      with a most satisfactory and encouraging briskness.
    </p>
    <p>
      The driver&rsquo;s name, as he soon informed Martin, was William Simmons, better
      known as Bill; and his spruce appearance was sufficiently explained by his
      connection with a large stage-coaching establishment at Hounslow, whither
      he was conveying his load from a farm belonging to the concern in
      Wiltshire. He was frequently up and down the road on such errands, he
      said, and to look after the sick and rest horses, of which animals he had
      much to relate that occupied a long time in the telling. He aspired to the
      dignity of the regular box, and expected an appointment on the first
      vacancy. He was musical besides, and had a little key-bugle in his pocket,
      on which, whenever the conversation flagged, he played the first part of a
      great many tunes, and regularly broke down in the second.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Ah!&rsquo; said Bill, with a sigh, as he drew the back of his hand across his
      lips, and put this instrument in his pocket, after screwing off the
      mouth-piece to drain it; &lsquo;Lummy Ned of the Light Salisbury, <i>he</i> was the one
      for musical talents. He <i>was </i>a guard. What you may call a Guard&rsquo;an Angel,
      was Ned.&rsquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Is he dead?&rsquo; asked Martin.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Dead!&rsquo; replied the other, with a contemptuous emphasis. &lsquo;Not he. You
      won&rsquo;t catch Ned a-dying easy. No, no. He knows better than that.&rsquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;You spoke of him in the past tense,&rsquo; observed Martin, &lsquo;so I supposed he
      was no more.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;He&rsquo;s no more in England,&rsquo; said Bill, &lsquo;if that&rsquo;s what you mean. He went to
      the U-nited States.&rsquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Did he?&rsquo; asked Martin, with sudden interest. &lsquo;When?&rsquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Five year ago, or then about,&rsquo; said Bill. &lsquo;He had set up in the public
      line here, and couldn&rsquo;t meet his engagements, so he cut off to Liverpool
      one day, without saying anything about it, and went and shipped himself
      for the U-nited States.&rsquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Well?&rsquo; said Martin.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Well! as he landed there without a penny to bless himself with, of course
      they wos very glad to see him in the U-nited States.&rsquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;What do you mean?&rsquo; asked Martin, with some scorn.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;What do I mean?&rsquo; said Bill. &lsquo;Why, <i>that</i>. All men are alike in the U-nited
      States, an&rsquo;t they? It makes no odds whether a man has a thousand pound, or
      nothing, there. Particular in New York, I&rsquo;m told, where Ned landed.&rsquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;New York, was it?&rsquo; asked Martin, thoughtfully.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Yes,&rsquo; said Bill. &lsquo;New York. I know that, because he sent word home that
      it brought Old York to his mind, quite vivid, in consequence of being so
      exactly unlike it in every respect. I don&rsquo;t understand what particular
      business Ned turned his mind to, when he got there; but he wrote home that
      him and his friends was always a-singing, Ale Columbia, and blowing up the
      President, so I suppose it was something in the public line; or
      free-and-easy way again. Anyhow, he made his fortune.&rsquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;No!&rsquo; cried Martin.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Yes, he did,&rsquo; said Bill. &lsquo;I know that, because he lost it all the day
      after, in six-and-twenty banks as broke. He settled a lot of the notes on
      his father, when it was ascertained that they was really stopped and sent
      &lsquo;em over with a dutiful letter. I know that, because they was shown down
      our yard for the old gentleman&rsquo;s benefit, that he might treat himself with
      tobacco in the workus.&rsquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;He was a foolish fellow not to take care of his money when he had it,&rsquo;
      said Martin, indignantly.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;There you&rsquo;re right,&rsquo; said Bill, &lsquo;especially as it was all in paper, and
      he might have took care of it so very easy, by folding it up in a small
      parcel.&rsquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      Martin said nothing in reply, but soon afterwards fell asleep, and
      remained so for an hour or more. When he awoke, finding it had ceased to
      rain, he took his seat beside the driver, and asked him several questions;
      as how long had the fortunate guard of the Light Salisbury been in
      crossing the Atlantic; at what time of the year had he sailed; what was
      the name of the ship in which he made the voyage; how much had he paid for
      passage-money; did he suffer greatly from sea-sickness? and so forth. But
      on these points of detail his friend was possessed of little or no
      information; either answering obviously at random or acknowledging that he
      had never heard, or had forgotten; nor, although he returned to the charge
      very often, could he obtain any useful intelligence on these essential
      particulars.
    </p>
    <p>
      They jogged on all day, and stopped so often&mdash;now to refresh, now to
      change their team of horses, now to exchange or bring away a set of
      harness, now on one point of business, and now upon another, connected
      with the coaching on that line of road&mdash;that it was midnight when
      they reached Hounslow. A little short of the stables for which the van was
      bound, Martin got down, paid his crown, and forced his silk handkerchief
      upon his honest friend, notwithstanding the many protestations that he
      didn&rsquo;t wish to deprive him of it, with which he tried to give the lie to
      his longing looks. That done, they parted company; and when the van had
      driven into its own yard and the gates were closed, Martin stood in the
      dark street, with a pretty strong sense of being shut out, alone, upon the
      dreary world, without the key of it.
    </p>
    <p>
      But in this moment of despondency, and often afterwards, the recollection
      of Mr Pecksniff operated as a cordial to him; awakening in his breast an
      indignation that was very wholesome in nerving him to obstinate endurance.
      Under the influence of this fiery dram he started off for London without
      more ado. Arriving there in the middle of the night, and not knowing where
      to find a tavern open, he was fain to stroll about the streets and
      market-places until morning.
    </p>
    <p>
      He found himself, about an hour before dawn, in the humbler regions of the
      Adelphi; and addressing himself to a man in a fur-cap, who was taking down
      the shutters of an obscure public-house, informed him that he was a
      stranger, and inquired if he could have a bed there. It happened by good
      luck that he could. Though none of the gaudiest, it was tolerably clean,
      and Martin felt very glad and grateful when he crept into it, for warmth,
      rest, and forgetfulness.
    </p>
    <p>
      It was quite late in the afternoon when he awoke; and by the time he had
      washed and dressed, and broken his fast, it was growing dusk again. This
      was all the better, for it was now a matter of absolute necessity that he
      should part with his watch to some obliging pawn-broker. He would have
      waited until after dark for this purpose, though it had been the longest
      day in the year, and he had begun it without a breakfast.
    </p>
    <p>
      He passed more Golden Balls than all the jugglers in Europe have juggled
      with, in the course of their united performances, before he could
      determine in favour of any particular shop where those symbols were
      displayed. In the end he came back to one of the first he had seen, and
      entering by a side-door in a court, where the three balls, with the legend
      &lsquo;Money Lent,&rsquo; were repeated in a ghastly transparency, passed into one of
      a series of little closets, or private boxes, erected for the
      accommodation of the more bashful and uninitiated customers. He bolted
      himself in; pulled out his watch; and laid it on the counter.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Upon my life and soul!&rsquo; said a low voice in the next box to the shopman
      who was in treaty with him, &lsquo;you must make it more; you must make it a
      trifle more, you must indeed! You must dispense with one half-quarter of
      an ounce in weighing out your pound of flesh, my best of friends, and make
      it two-and-six.&rsquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      Martin drew back involuntarily, for he knew the voice at once.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;You&rsquo;re always full of your chaff,&rsquo; said the shopman, rolling up the
      article (which looked like a shirt) quite as a matter of course, and
      nibbing his pen upon the counter.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;I shall never be full of my wheat,&rsquo; said Mr Tigg, &lsquo;as long as I come
      here. Ha, ha! Not bad! Make it two-and-six, my dear friend, positively for
      this occasion only. Half-a-crown is a delightful coin. Two-and-six. Going
      at two-and-six! For the last time at two-and-six!&rsquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;It&rsquo;ll never be the last time till it&rsquo;s quite worn out,&rsquo; rejoined the
      shopman. &lsquo;It&rsquo;s grown yellow in the service as it is.&rsquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Its master has grown yellow in the service, if you mean that, my friend,&rsquo;
      said Mr Tigg; &lsquo;in the patriotic service of an ungrateful country. You are
      making it two-and-six, I think?&rsquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;I&rsquo;m making it,&rsquo; returned the shopman, &lsquo;what it always has been&mdash;two
      shillings. Same name as usual, I suppose?&rsquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Still the same name,&rsquo; said Mr Tigg; &lsquo;my claim to the dormant peerage not
      being yet established by the House of Lords.&rsquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;The old address?&rsquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Not at all,&rsquo; said Mr Tigg; &lsquo;I have removed my town establishment from
      thirty-eight, Mayfair, to number fifteen-hundred-and-forty-two, Park
      Lane.&rsquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Come, I&rsquo;m not going to put down that, you know,&rsquo; said the shopman with a
      grin.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;You may put down what you please, my friend,&rsquo; quoth Mr Tigg. &lsquo;The fact is
      still the same. The apartments for the under-butler and the fifth footman
      being of a most confounded low and vulgar kind at thirty-eight, Mayfair, I
      have been compelled, in my regard for the feelings which do them so much
      honour, to take on lease for seven, fourteen, or twenty-one years,
      renewable at the option of the tenant, the elegant and commodious family
      mansion, number fifteen-hundred-and-forty-two Park Lane. Make it
      two-and-six, and come and see me!&rsquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      The shopman was so highly entertained by this piece of humour that Mr Tigg
      himself could not repress some little show of exultation. It vented
      itself, in part, in a desire to see how the occupant of the next box
      received his pleasantry; to ascertain which he glanced round the
      partition, and immediately, by the gaslight, recognized Martin.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;I wish I may die,&rsquo; said Mr Tigg, stretching out his body so far that his
      head was as much in Martin&rsquo;s little cell as Martin&rsquo;s own head was, &lsquo;but
      this is one of the most tremendous meetings in Ancient or Modern History!
      How are you? What is the news from the agricultural districts? How are our
      friends the P.&lsquo;s? Ha, ha! David, pay particular attention to this
      gentleman immediately, as a friend of mine, I beg.&rsquo;
    </p>
<div class="fig" style="width:65%">

    <h5>
      <a href="images/20255.jpg"><i>Original</i></a>
    </h5>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Here! Please to give me the most you can for this,&rsquo; said Martin, handing
      the watch to the shopman. &lsquo;I want money sorely.&rsquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;He wants money, sorely!&rsquo; cried Mr Tigg with excessive sympathy. &lsquo;David,
      will you have the goodness to do your very utmost for my friend, who wants
      money sorely. You will deal with my friend as if he were myself. A gold
      hunting-watch, David, engine-turned, capped and jewelled in four holes,
      escape movement, horizontal lever, and warranted to perform correctly,
      upon my personal reputation, who have observed it narrowly for many years,
      under the most trying circumstances&rsquo;&mdash;here he winked at Martin, that
      he might understand this recommendation would have an immense effect upon
      the shopman; &lsquo;what do you say, David, to my friend? Be very particular to
      deserve my custom and recommendation, David.&rsquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;I can lend you three pounds on this, if you like&rsquo; said the shopman to
      Martin, confidentially. &lsquo;It is very old-fashioned. I couldn&rsquo;t say more.&rsquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;And devilish handsome, too,&rsquo; cried Mr Tigg. &lsquo;Two-twelve-six for the
      watch, and seven-and-six for personal regard. I am gratified; it may be
      weakness, but I am. Three pounds will do. We take it. The name of my
      friend is Smivey: Chicken Smivey, of Holborn, twenty-six-and-a-half B:
      lodger.&rsquo; Here he winked at Martin again, to apprise him that all the forms
      and ceremonies prescribed by law were now complied with, and nothing
      remained but the receipt for the money.
    </p>
    <p>
      In point of fact, this proved to be the case, for Martin, who had no
      resource but to take what was offered him, signified his acquiescence by a
      nod of his head, and presently came out with the cash in his pocket. He
      was joined in the entry by Mr Tigg, who warmly congratulated him, as he
      took his arm and accompanied him into the street, on the successful issue
      of the negotiation.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;As for my part in the same,&rsquo; said Mr Tigg, &lsquo;don&rsquo;t mention it. Don&rsquo;t
      compliment me, for I can&rsquo;t bear it!&rsquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;I have no such intention, I assure you,&rsquo; retorted Martin, releasing his
      arm and stopping.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;You oblige me very much&rsquo; said Mr Tigg. &lsquo;Thank you.&rsquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Now, sir,&rsquo; observed Martin, biting his lip, &lsquo;this is a large town, and we
      can easily find different ways in it. If you will show me which is your
      way, I will take another.&rsquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      Mr Tigg was about to speak, but Martin interposed:
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;I need scarcely tell you, after what you have just seen, that I have
      nothing to bestow upon your friend Mr Slyme. And it is quite as
      unnecessary for me to tell you that I don&rsquo;t desire the honour of your
      company.&rsquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Stop&rsquo; cried Mr Tigg, holding out his hand. &lsquo;Hold! There is a most
      remarkably long-headed, flowing-bearded, and patriarchal proverb, which
      observes that it is the duty of a man to be just before he is generous. Be
      just now, and you can be generous presently. Do not confuse me with the
      man Slyme. Do not distinguish the man Slyme as a friend of mine, for he is
      no such thing. I have been compelled, sir, to abandon the party whom you
      call Slyme. I have no knowledge of the party whom you call Slyme. I am,
      sir,&rsquo; said Mr Tigg, striking himself upon the breast, &lsquo;a premium tulip, of
      a very different growth and cultivation from the cabbage Slyme, sir.&rsquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;It matters very little to me,&rsquo; said Martin coolly, &lsquo;whether you have set
      up as a vagabond on your own account, or are still trading on behalf of Mr
      Slyme. I wish to hold no correspondence with you. In the devil&rsquo;s name,
      man&rsquo; said Martin, scarcely able, despite his vexation, to repress a smile
      as Mr Tigg stood leaning his back against the shutters of a shop window,
      adjusting his hair with great composure, &lsquo;will you go one way or other?&rsquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;You will allow me to remind you, sir,&rsquo; said Mr Tigg, with sudden dignity,
      &lsquo;that you&mdash;not I&mdash;that you&mdash;I say emphatically, <i>you</i>&mdash;have
      reduced the proceedings of this evening to a cold and distant matter of
      business, when I was disposed to place them on a friendly footing. It
      being made a matter of business, sir, I beg to say that I expect a trifle
      (which I shall bestow in charity) as commission upon the pecuniary
      advance, in which I have rendered you my humble services. After the terms
      in which you have addressed me, sir,&rsquo; concluded Mr Tigg, &lsquo;you will not
      insult me, if you please, by offering more than half-a-crown.&rsquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      Martin drew that piece of money from his pocket, and tossed it towards
      him. Mr Tigg caught it, looked at it to assure himself of its goodness,
      spun it in the air after the manner of a pieman, and buttoned it up.
      Finally, he raised his hat an inch or two from his head with a military
      air, and, after pausing a moment with deep gravity, as to decide in which
      direction he should go, and to what Earl or Marquis among his friends he
      should give the preference in his next call, stuck his hands in his
      skirt-pockets and swaggered round the corner. Martin took the directly
      opposite course; and so, to his great content, they parted company.
    </p>
    <p>
      It was with a bitter sense of humiliation that he cursed, again and again,
      the mischance of having encountered this man in the pawnbroker&rsquo;s shop. The
      only comfort he had in the recollection was, Mr Tigg&rsquo;s voluntary avowal of
      a separation between himself and Slyme, that would at least prevent his
      circumstances (so Martin argued) from being known to any member of his
      family, the bare possibility of which filled him with shame and wounded
      pride. Abstractedly there was greater reason, perhaps, for supposing any
      declaration of Mr Tigg&rsquo;s to be false, than for attaching the least
      credence to it; but remembering the terms on which the intimacy between
      that gentleman and his bosom friend had subsisted, and the strong
      probability of Mr Tigg&rsquo;s having established an independent business of his
      own on Mr Slyme&rsquo;s connection, it had a reasonable appearance of
      probability; at all events, Martin hoped so; and that went a long way.
    </p>
    <p>
      His first step, now that he had a supply of ready money for his present
      necessities, was, to retain his bed at the public-house until further
      notice, and to write a formal note to Tom Pinch (for he knew Pecksniff
      would see it) requesting to have his clothes forwarded to London by coach,
      with a direction to be left at the office until called for. These measures
      taken, he passed the interval before the box arrived&mdash;three days&mdash;in
      making inquiries relative to American vessels, at the offices of various
      shipping-agents in the city; and in lingering about the docks and wharves,
      with the faint hope of stumbling upon some engagement for the voyage, as
      clerk or supercargo, or custodian of something or somebody, which would
      enable him to procure a free passage. But finding, soon, that no such
      means of employment were likely to present themselves, and dreading the
      consequences of delay, he drew up a short advertisement, stating what he
      wanted, and inserted it in the leading newspapers. Pending the receipt of
      the twenty or thirty answers which he vaguely expected, he reduced his
      wardrobe to the narrowest limits consistent with decent respectability,
      and carried the overplus at different times to the pawnbroker&rsquo;s shop, for
      conversion into money.
    </p>
    <p>
      And it was strange, very strange, even to himself, to find how, by quick
      though almost imperceptible degrees, he lost his delicacy and
      self-respect, and gradually came to do that as a matter of course, without
      the least compunction, which but a few short days before had galled him to
      the quick. The first time he visited the pawnbroker&rsquo;s, he felt on his way
      there as if every person whom he passed suspected whither he was going;
      and on his way back again, as if the whole human tide he stemmed, knew
      well where he had come from. When did he care to think of their
      discernment now! In his first wanderings up and down the weary streets, he
      counterfeited the walk of one who had an object in his view; but soon
      there came upon him the sauntering, slipshod gait of listless idleness,
      and the lounging at street-corners, and plucking and biting of stray bits
      of straw, and strolling up and down the same place, and looking into the
      same shop-windows, with a miserable indifference, fifty times a day. At
      first, he came out from his lodging with an uneasy sense of being observed&mdash;even
      by those chance passers-by, on whom he had never looked before, and
      hundreds to one would never see again&mdash;issuing in the morning from a
      public-house; but now, in his comings-out and goings-in he did not mind to
      lounge about the door, or to stand sunning himself in careless thought
      beside the wooden stem, studded from head to heel with pegs, on which the
      beer-pots dangled like so many boughs upon a pewter-tree. And yet it took
      but five weeks to reach the lowest round of this tall ladder!
    </p>
    <p>
      Oh, moralists, who treat of happiness and self-respect, innate in every
      sphere of life, and shedding light on every grain of dust in God&rsquo;s
      highway, so smooth below your carriage-wheels, so rough beneath the tread
      of naked feet, bethink yourselves in looking on the swift descent of men
      who <i>have </i>lived in their own esteem, that there are scores of thousands
      breathing now, and breathing thick with painful toil, who in that high
      respect have never lived at all, nor had a chance of life! Go ye, who rest
      so placidly upon the sacred Bard who had been young, and when he strung
      his harp was old, and had never seen the righteous forsaken, or his seed
      begging their bread; go, Teachers of content and honest pride, into the
      mine, the mill, the forge, the squalid depths of deepest ignorance, and
      uttermost abyss of man&rsquo;s neglect, and say can any hopeful plant spring up
      in air so foul that it extinguishes the soul&rsquo;s bright torch as fast as it
      is kindled! And, oh! ye Pharisees of the nineteen hundredth year of
      Christian Knowledge, who soundingly appeal to human nature, see that it be
      human first. Take heed it has not been transformed, during your slumber
      and the sleep of generations, into the nature of the Beasts!
    </p>
    <p>
      Five weeks! Of all the twenty or thirty answers, not one had come. His
      money&mdash;even the additional stock he had raised from the disposal of
      his spare clothes (and that was not much, for clothes, though dear to buy,
      are cheap to pawn)&mdash;was fast diminishing. Yet what could he do? At
      times an agony came over him in which he darted forth again, though he was
      but newly home, and, returning to some place where he had been already
      twenty times, made some new attempt to gain his end, but always
      unsuccessfully. He was years and years too old for a cabin-boy, and years
      upon years too inexperienced to be accepted as a common seaman. His dress
      and manner, too, militated fatally against any such proposal as the
      latter; and yet he was reduced to making it; for even if he could have
      contemplated the being set down in America totally without money, he had
      not enough left now for a steerage passage and the poorest provisions upon
      the voyage.
    </p>
    <p>
      It is an illustration of a very common tendency in the mind of man, that
      all this time he never once doubted, one may almost say the certainty of
      doing great things in the New World, if he could only get there. In
      proportion as he became more and more dejected by his present
      circumstances, and the means of gaining America receded from his grasp,
      the more he fretted himself with the conviction that that was the only
      place in which he could hope to achieve any high end, and worried his
      brain with the thought that men going there in the meanwhile might
      anticipate him in the attainment of those objects which were dearest to
      his heart. He often thought of John Westlock, and besides looking out for
      him on all occasions, actually walked about London for three days together
      for the express purpose of meeting with him. But although he failed in
      this; and although he would not have scrupled to borrow money of him; and
      although he believed that John would have lent it; yet still he could not
      bring his mind to write to Pinch and inquire where he was to be found. For
      although, as we have seen, he was fond of Tom after his own fashion, he
      could not endure the thought (feeling so superior to Tom) of making him
      the stepping-stone to his fortune, or being anything to him but a patron;
      and his pride so revolted from the idea that it restrained him even now.
    </p>
    <p>
      It might have yielded, however; and no doubt must have yielded soon, but
      for a very strange and unlooked-for occurrence.
    </p>
    <p>
      The five weeks had quite run out, and he was in a truly desperate plight,
      when one evening, having just returned to his lodging, and being in the
      act of lighting his candle at the gas jet in the bar before stalking
      moodily upstairs to his own room, his landlord called him by his name. Now
      as he had never told it to the man, but had scrupulously kept it to
      himself, he was not a little startled by this; and so plainly showed his
      agitation that the landlord, to reassure him, said &lsquo;it was only a letter.&rsquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;A letter!&rsquo; cried Martin.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;For Mr Martin Chuzzlewit,&rsquo; said the landlord, reading the superscription
      of one he held in his hand. &lsquo;Noon. Chief office. Paid.&rsquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      Martin took it from him, thanked him, and walked upstairs. It was not
      sealed, but pasted close; the handwriting was quite unknown to him. He
      opened it and found enclosed, without any name, address, or other
      inscription or explanation of any kind whatever, a Bank of England note
      for Twenty Pounds.
    </p>
    <p>
      To say that he was perfectly stunned with astonishment and delight; that
      he looked again and again at the note and the wrapper; that he hurried
      below stairs to make quite certain that the note was a good note; and then
      hurried up again to satisfy himself for the fiftieth time that he had not
      overlooked some scrap of writing on the wrapper; that he exhausted and
      bewildered himself with conjectures; and could make nothing of it but that
      there the note was, and he was suddenly enriched; would be only to relate
      so many matters of course to no purpose. The final upshot of the business
      at that time was, that he resolved to treat himself to a comfortable but
      frugal meal in his own chamber; and having ordered a fire to be kindled,
      went out to purchase it forthwith.
    </p>
    <p>
      He bought some cold beef, and ham, and French bread, and butter, and came
      back with his pockets pretty heavily laden. It was somewhat of a damping
      circumstance to find the room full of smoke, which was attributable to two
      causes; firstly, to the flue being naturally vicious and a smoker; and
      secondly, to their having forgotten, in lighting the fire, an odd sack or
      two and some trifles, which had been put up the chimney to keep the rain
      out. They had already remedied this oversight, however; and propped up the
      window-sash with a bundle of firewood to keep it open; so that except in
      being rather inflammatory to the eyes and choking to the lungs, the
      apartment was quite comfortable.
    </p>
    <p>
      Martin was in no vein to quarrel with it, if it had been in less tolerable
      order, especially when a gleaming pint of porter was set upon the table,
      and the servant-girl withdrew, bearing with her particular instructions
      relative to the production of something hot when he should ring the bell.
      The cold meat being wrapped in a playbill, Martin laid the cloth by
      spreading that document on the little round table with the print
      downwards, and arranging the collation upon it. The foot of the bed, which
      was very close to the fire, answered for a sideboard; and when he had
      completed these preparations, he squeezed an old arm-chair into the
      warmest corner, and sat down to enjoy himself.
    </p>
    <p>
      He had begun to eat with great appetite, glancing round the room meanwhile
      with a triumphant anticipation of quitting it for ever on the morrow, when
      his attention was arrested by a stealthy footstep on the stairs, and
      presently by a knock at his chamber door, which, although it was a gentle
      knock enough, communicated such a start to the bundle of firewood, that it
      instantly leaped out of window, and plunged into the street.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;More coals, I suppose,&rsquo; said Martin. &lsquo;Come in!&rsquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;It an&rsquo;t a liberty, sir, though it seems so,&rsquo; rejoined a man&rsquo;s voice.
      &lsquo;Your servant, sir. Hope you&rsquo;re pretty well, sir.&rsquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      Martin stared at the face that was bowing in the doorway, perfectly
      remembering the features and expression, but quite forgetting to whom they
      belonged.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Tapley, sir,&rsquo; said his visitor. &lsquo;Him as formerly lived at the Dragon,
      sir, and was forced to leave in consequence of a want of jollity, sir.&rsquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;To be sure!&rsquo; cried Martin. &lsquo;Why, how did you come here?&rsquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Right through the passage, and up the stairs, sir,&rsquo; said Mark.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;How did you find me out, I mean?&rsquo; asked Martin.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Why, sir,&rsquo; said Mark, &lsquo;I&rsquo;ve passed you once or twice in the street, if
      I&rsquo;m not mistaken; and when I was a-looking in at the beef-and-ham shop
      just now, along with a hungry sweep, as was very much calculated to make a
      man jolly, sir&mdash;I see you a-buying that.&rsquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      Martin reddened as he pointed to the table, and said, somewhat hastily:
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Well! What then?&rsquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Why, then, sir,&rsquo; said Mark, &lsquo;I made bold to foller; and as I told &lsquo;em
      downstairs that you expected me, I was let up.&rsquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Are you charged with any message, that you told them you were expected?&rsquo;
      inquired Martin.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;No, sir, I an&rsquo;t,&rsquo; said Mark. &lsquo;That was what you may call a pious fraud,
      sir, that was.&rsquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      Martin cast an angry look at him; but there was something in the fellow&rsquo;s
      merry face, and in his manner&mdash;which with all its cheerfulness was
      far from being obtrusive or familiar&mdash;that quite disarmed him. He had
      lived a solitary life too, for many weeks, and the voice was pleasant in
      his ear.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Tapley,&rsquo; he said, &lsquo;I&rsquo;ll deal openly with you. From all I can judge and
      from all I have heard of you through Pinch, you are not a likely kind of
      fellow to have been brought here by impertinent curiosity or any other
      offensive motive. Sit down. I&rsquo;m glad to see you.&rsquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Thankee, sir,&rsquo; said Mark. &lsquo;I&rsquo;d as lieve stand.&rsquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;If you don&rsquo;t sit down,&rsquo; retorted Martin, &lsquo;I&rsquo;ll not talk to you.&rsquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Very good, sir,&rsquo; observed Mark. &lsquo;Your will&rsquo;s a law, sir. Down it is;&rsquo; and
      he sat down accordingly upon the bedstead.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Help yourself,&rsquo; said Martin, handing him the only knife.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Thankee, sir,&rsquo; rejoined Mark. &lsquo;After you&rsquo;ve done.&rsquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;If you don&rsquo;t take it now, you&rsquo;ll not have any,&rsquo; said Martin.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Very good, sir,&rsquo; rejoined Mark. &lsquo;That being your desire&mdash;now it is.&rsquo;
      With which reply he gravely helped himself and went on eating. Martin
      having done the like for a short time in silence, said abruptly:
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;What are you doing in London?&rsquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Nothing at all, sir,&rsquo; rejoined Mark.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;How&rsquo;s that?&rsquo; asked Martin.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;I want a place,&rsquo; said Mark.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;I&rsquo;m sorry for you,&rsquo; said Martin.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;&mdash;To attend upon a single gentleman,&rsquo; resumed Mark. &lsquo;If from the
      country the more desirable. Makeshifts would be preferred. Wages no
      object.&rsquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      He said this so pointedly, that Martin stopped in his eating, and said:
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;If you mean me&mdash;&rsquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Yes, I do, sir,&rsquo; interposed Mark.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Then you may judge from my style of living here, of my means of keeping a
      man-servant. Besides, I am going to America immediately.&rsquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Well, sir,&rsquo; returned Mark, quite unmoved by this intelligence &lsquo;from all
      that ever I heard about it, I should say America is a very likely sort of
      place for me to be jolly in!&rsquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      Again Martin looked at him angrily; and again his anger melted away in
      spite of himself.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Lord bless you, sir,&rsquo; said Mark, &lsquo;what is the use of us a-going round and
      round, and hiding behind the corner, and dodging up and down, when we can
      come straight to the point in six words? I&rsquo;ve had my eye upon you any time
      this fortnight. I see well enough there&rsquo;s a screw loose in your affairs. I
      know&rsquo;d well enough the first time I see you down at the Dragon that it
      must be so, sooner or later. Now, sir here am I, without a sitiwation;
      without any want of wages for a year to come; for I saved up (I didn&rsquo;t
      mean to do it, but I couldn&rsquo;t help it) at the Dragon&mdash;here am I with
      a liking for what&rsquo;s wentersome, and a liking for you, and a wish to come
      out strong under circumstances as would keep other men down; and will you
      take me, or will you leave me?&rsquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;How can I take you?&rsquo; cried Martin.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;When I say take,&rsquo; rejoined Mark, &lsquo;I mean will you let me go? and when I
      say will you let me go, I mean will you let me go along with you? for go I
      will, somehow or another. Now that you&rsquo;ve said America, I see clear at
      once, that that&rsquo;s the place for me to be jolly in. Therefore, if I don&rsquo;t
      pay my own passage in the ship you go in, sir, I&rsquo;ll pay my own passage in
      another. And mark my words, if I go alone it shall be, to carry out the
      principle, in the rottenest, craziest, leakingest tub of a wessel that a
      place can be got in for love or money. So if I&rsquo;m lost upon the way, sir,
      there&rsquo;ll be a drowned man at your door&mdash;and always a-knocking double
      knocks at it, too, or never trust me!&rsquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;This is mere folly,&rsquo; said Martin.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Very good, sir,&rsquo; returned Mark. &lsquo;I&rsquo;m glad to hear it, because if you
      don&rsquo;t mean to let me go, you&rsquo;ll be more comfortable, perhaps, on account
      of thinking so. Therefore I contradict no gentleman. But all I say is,
      that if I don&rsquo;t emigrate to America in that case, in the beastliest old
      cockle-shell as goes out of port, I&rsquo;m&mdash;&rsquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;You don&rsquo;t mean what you say, I&rsquo;m sure,&rsquo; said Martin.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Yes I do,&rsquo; cried Mark.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;I tell you I know better,&rsquo; rejoined Martin.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Very good, sir,&rsquo; said Mark, with the same air of perfect satisfaction.
      &lsquo;Let it stand that way at present, sir, and wait and see how it turns out.
      Why, love my heart alive! the only doubt I have is, whether there&rsquo;s any
      credit in going with a gentleman like you, that&rsquo;s as certain to make his
      way there as a gimlet is to go through soft deal.&rsquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      This was touching Martin on his weak point, and having him at a great
      advantage. He could not help thinking, either, what a brisk fellow this
      Mark was, and how great a change he had wrought in the atmosphere of the
      dismal little room already.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Why, certainly, Mark,&rsquo; he said, &lsquo;I have hopes of doing well there, or I
      shouldn&rsquo;t go. I may have the qualifications for doing well, perhaps.&rsquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Of course you have, sir,&rsquo; returned Mark Tapley. &lsquo;Everybody knows that.&rsquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;You see,&rsquo; said Martin, leaning his chin upon his hand, and looking at the
      fire, &lsquo;ornamental architecture applied to domestic purposes, can hardly
      fail to be in great request in that country; for men are constantly
      changing their residences there, and moving further off; and it&rsquo;s clear
      they must have houses to live in.&rsquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;I should say, sir,&rsquo; observed Mark, &lsquo;that that&rsquo;s a state of things as
      opens one of the jolliest look-outs for domestic architecture that ever I
      heerd tell on.&rsquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      Martin glanced at him hastily, not feeling quite free from a suspicion
      that this remark implied a doubt of the successful issue of his plans. But
      Mr Tapley was eating the boiled beef and bread with such entire good faith
      and singleness of purpose expressed in his visage that he could not but be
      satisfied. Another doubt arose in his mind however, as this one
      disappeared. He produced the blank cover in which the note had been
      enclosed, and fixing his eyes on Mark as he put it in his hands, said:
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Now tell me the truth. Do you know anything about that?&rsquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      Mark turned it over and over; held it near his eyes; held it away from him
      at arm&rsquo;s length; held it with the superscription upwards and with the
      superscription downwards; and shook his head with such a genuine
      expression of astonishment at being asked the question, that Martin said,
      as he took it from him again:
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;No, I see you don&rsquo;t. How should you! Though, indeed, your knowing about
      it would not be more extraordinary than its being here. Come, Tapley,&rsquo; he
      added, after a moment&rsquo;s thought, &lsquo;I&rsquo;ll trust you with my history, such as
      it is, and then you&rsquo;ll see more clearly what sort of fortunes you would
      link yourself to, if you followed me.&rsquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;I beg your pardon, sir,&rsquo; said Mark; &lsquo;but afore you enter upon it will you
      take me if I choose to go? Will you turn off me&mdash;Mark Tapley&mdash;formerly
      of the Blue Dragon, as can be well recommended by Mr Pinch, and as wants a
      gentleman of your strength of mind to look up to; or will you, in climbing
      the ladder as you&rsquo;re certain to get to the top of, take me along with you
      at a respectful distance? Now, sir,&rsquo; said Mark, &lsquo;it&rsquo;s of very little
      importance to you, I know, there&rsquo;s the difficulty; but it&rsquo;s of very great
      importance to me, and will you be so good as to consider of it?&rsquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      If this were meant as a second appeal to Martin&rsquo;s weak side, founded on
      his observation of the effect of the first, Mr Tapley was a skillful and
      shrewd observer. Whether an intentional or an accidental shot, it hit the
      mark fully for Martin, relenting more and more, said with a condescension
      which was inexpressibly delicious to him, after his recent humiliation:
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;We&rsquo;ll see about it, Tapley. You shall tell me in what disposition you
      find yourself to-morrow.&rsquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Then, sir,&rsquo; said Mark, rubbing his hands, &lsquo;the job&rsquo;s done. Go on, sir, if
      you please. I&rsquo;m all attention.&rsquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      Throwing himself back in his arm-chair, and looking at the fire, with now
      and then a glance at Mark, who at such times nodded his head sagely, to
      express his profound interest and attention. Martin ran over the chief
      points in his history, to the same effect as he had related them, weeks
      before, to Mr Pinch. But he adapted them, according to the best of his
      judgment, to Mr Tapley&rsquo;s comprehension; and with that view made as light
      of his love affair as he could, and referred to it in very few words. But
      here he reckoned without his host; for Mark&rsquo;s interest was keenest in this
      part of the business, and prompted him to ask sundry questions in relation
      to it; for which he apologised as one in some measure privileged to do so,
      from having seen (as Martin explained to him) the young lady at the Blue
      Dragon.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;And a young lady as any gentleman ought to feel more proud of being in
      love with,&rsquo; said Mark, energetically, &lsquo;don&rsquo;t draw breath.&rsquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Aye! You saw her when she was not happy,&rsquo; said Martin, gazing at the fire
      again. &lsquo;If you had seen her in the old times, indeed&mdash;&rsquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Why, she certainly was a little down-hearted, sir, and something paler in
      her colour than I could have wished,&rsquo; said Mark, &lsquo;but none the worse in
      her looks for that. I think she seemed better, sir, after she come to
      London.&rsquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      Martin withdrew his eyes from the fire; stared at Mark as if he thought he
      had suddenly gone mad; and asked him what he meant.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;No offence intended, sir,&rsquo; urged Mark. &lsquo;I don&rsquo;t mean to say she was any
      the happier without you; but I thought she was a-looking better, sir.&rsquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Do you mean to tell me she has been in London?&rsquo; asked Martin, rising
      hurriedly, and pushing back his chair.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Of course I do,&rsquo; said Mark, rising too, in great amazement from the
      bedstead.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Do you mean to tell me she is in London now?&rsquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Most likely, sir. I mean to say she was a week ago.&rsquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;And you know where?&rsquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Yes!&rsquo; cried Mark. &lsquo;What! Don&rsquo;t you?&rsquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;My good fellow!&rsquo; exclaimed Martin, clutching him by both arms, &lsquo;I have
      never seen her since I left my grandfather&rsquo;s house.&rsquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Why, then!&rsquo; cried Mark, giving the little table such a blow with his
      clenched fist that the slices of beef and ham danced upon it, while all
      his features seemed, with delight, to be going up into his forehead, and
      never coming back again any more, &lsquo;if I an&rsquo;t your nat&rsquo;ral born servant,
      hired by Fate, there an&rsquo;t such a thing in natur&rsquo; as a Blue Dragon. What!
      when I was a-rambling up and down a old churchyard in the City, getting
      myself into a jolly state, didn&rsquo;t I see your grandfather a-toddling to and
      fro for pretty nigh a mortal hour! Didn&rsquo;t I watch him into Todgers&rsquo;s
      commercial boarding-house, and watch him out, and watch him home to his
      hotel, and go and tell him as his was the service for my money, and I had
      said so, afore I left the Dragon! Wasn&rsquo;t the young lady a-sitting with him
      then, and didn&rsquo;t she fall a-laughing in a manner as was beautiful to see!
      Didn&rsquo;t your grandfather say, &ldquo;Come back again next week,&rdquo; and didn&rsquo;t I go
      next week; and didn&rsquo;t he say that he couldn&rsquo;t make up his mind to trust
      nobody no more; and therefore wouldn&rsquo;t engage me, but at the same time
      stood something to drink as was handsome! Why,&rsquo; cried Mr Tapley, with a
      comical mixture of delight and chagrin, &lsquo;where&rsquo;s the credit of a man&rsquo;s
      being jolly under such circumstances! Who could help it, when things come
      about like this!&rsquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      For some moments Martin stood gazing at him, as if he really doubted the
      evidence of his senses, and could not believe that Mark stood there, in
      the body, before him. At length he asked him whether, if the young lady
      were still in London, he thought he could contrive to deliver a letter to
      her secretly.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Do I think I can?&rsquo; cried Mark. &lsquo;<i>Think </i>I can? Here, sit down, sir. Write
      it out, sir!&rsquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      With that he cleared the table by the summary process of tilting
      everything upon it into the fireplace; snatched some writing materials
      from the mantel-shelf; set Martin&rsquo;s chair before them; forced him down
      into it; dipped a pen into the ink; and put it in his hand.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Cut away, sir!&rsquo; cried Mark. &lsquo;Make it strong, sir. Let it be wery pinted,
      sir. Do I think so? I should think so. Go to work, sir!&rsquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      Martin required no further adjuration, but went to work at a great rate;
      while Mr Tapley, installing himself without any more formalities into the
      functions of his valet and general attendant, divested himself of his
      coat, and went on to clear the fireplace and arrange the room; talking to
      himself in a low voice the whole time.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Jolly sort of lodgings,&rsquo; said Mark, rubbing his nose with the knob at the
      end of the fire-shovel, and looking round the poor chamber; &lsquo;that&rsquo;s a
      comfort. The rain&rsquo;s come through the roof too. That an&rsquo;t bad. A lively old
      bedstead, I&rsquo;ll be bound; popilated by lots of wampires, no doubt. Come! my
      spirits is a-getting up again. An uncommon ragged nightcap this. A very
      good sign. We shall do yet! Here, Jane, my dear,&rsquo; calling down the stairs,
      &lsquo;bring up that there hot tumbler for my master as was a-mixing when I come
      in. That&rsquo;s right, sir,&rsquo; to Martin. &lsquo;Go at it as if you meant it, sir. Be
      very tender, sir, if you please. You can&rsquo;t make it too strong, sir!&rsquo;

    <h2>
      CHAPTER FOURTEEN
    </h2>
    <p>
      IN WHICH MARTIN BIDS ADIEU TO THE LADY OF HIS LOVE; AND HONOURS AN OBSCURE
      INDIVIDUAL WHOSE FORTUNE HE INTENDS TO MAKE BY COMMENDING HER TO HIS
      PROTECTION
    </p>
    <p>
      The letter being duly signed, sealed, and delivered, was handed to Mark
      Tapley, for immediate conveyance if possible. And he succeeded so well in
      his embassy as to be enabled to return that same night, just as the house
      was closing, with the welcome intelligence that he had sent it upstairs to
      the young lady, enclosed in a small manuscript of his own, purporting to
      contain his further petition to be engaged in Mr Chuzzlewit&rsquo;s service; and
      that she had herself come down and told him, in great haste and agitation,
      that she would meet the gentleman at eight o&rsquo;clock to-morrow morning in
      St. James&rsquo;s Park. It was then agreed between the new master and the new
      man, that Mark should be in waiting near the hotel in good time, to escort
      the young lady to the place of appointment; and when they had parted for
      the night with this understanding, Martin took up his pen again; and
      before he went to bed wrote another letter, whereof more will be seen
      presently.
    </p>
    <p>
      He was up before daybreak, and came upon the Park with the morning, which
      was clad in the least engaging of the three hundred and sixty-five dresses
      in the wardrobe of the year. It was raw, damp, dark, and dismal; the
      clouds were as muddy as the ground; and the short perspective of every
      street and avenue was closed up by the mist as by a filthy curtain.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Fine weather indeed,&rsquo; Martin bitterly soliloquised, &lsquo;to be wandering up
      and down here in, like a thief! Fine weather indeed, for a meeting of
      lovers in the open air, and in a public walk! I need be departing, with
      all speed, for another country; for I have come to a pretty pass in this!&rsquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      He might perhaps have gone on to reflect that of all mornings in the year,
      it was not the best calculated for a young lady&rsquo;s coming forth on such an
      errand, either. But he was stopped on the road to this reflection, if his
      thoughts tended that way, by her appearance at a short distance, on which
      he hurried forward to meet her. Her squire, Mr Tapley, at the same time
      fell discreetly back, and surveyed the fog above him with an appearance of
      attentive interest.

    <p>
      &lsquo;My dear Martin,&rsquo; said Mary.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;My dear Mary,&rsquo; said Martin; and lovers are such a singular kind of people
      that this is all they did say just then, though Martin took her arm, and
      her hand too, and they paced up and down a short walk that was least
      exposed to observation, half-a-dozen times.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;If you have changed at all, my love, since we parted,&rsquo; said Martin at
      length, as he looked upon her with a proud delight, &lsquo;it is only to be more
      beautiful than ever!&rsquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      Had she been of the common metal of love-worn young ladies, she would have
      denied this in her most interesting manner; and would have told him that
      she knew she had become a perfect fright; or that she had wasted away with
      weeping and anxiety; or that she was dwindling gently into an early grave;
      or that her mental sufferings were unspeakable; or would, either by tears
      or words, or a mixture of both, have furnished him with some other
      information to that effect, and made him as miserable as possible. But she
      had been reared up in a sterner school than the minds of most young girls
      are formed in; she had had her nature strengthened by the hands of hard
      endurance and necessity; had come out from her young trials constant,
      self-denying, earnest, and devoted; had acquired in her maidenhood&mdash;whether
      happily in the end, for herself or him, is foreign to our present purpose
      to inquire&mdash;something of that nobler quality of gentle hearts which
      is developed often by the sorrows and struggles of matronly years, but
      often by their lessons only. Unspoiled, unpampered in her joys or griefs;
      with frank and full, and deep affection for the object of her early love;
      she saw in him one who for her sake was an outcast from his home and
      fortune, and she had no more idea of bestowing that love upon him in other
      than cheerful and sustaining words, full of high hope and grateful
      trustfulness, than she had of being unworthy of it, in her lightest
      thought or deed, for any base temptation that the world could offer.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;What change is there in <i>you</i>, Martin,&rsquo; she replied; &lsquo;for that concerns me
      nearest? You look more anxious and more thoughtful than you used.&rsquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Why, as to that, my love,&rsquo; said Martin as he drew her waist within his
      arm, first looking round to see that there were no observers near, and
      beholding Mr Tapley more intent than ever on the fog; &lsquo;it would be strange
      if I did not; for my life&mdash;especially of late&mdash;has been a hard
      one.&rsquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;I know it must have been,&rsquo; she answered. &lsquo;When have I forgotten to think
      of it and you?&rsquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Not often, I hope,&rsquo; said Martin. &lsquo;Not often, I am sure. Not often, I have
      some right to expect, Mary; for I have undergone a great deal of vexation
      and privation, and I naturally look for that return, you know.&rsquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;A very, very poor return,&rsquo; she answered with a fainter smile. &lsquo;But you
      have it, and will have it always. You have paid a dear price for a poor
      heart, Martin; but it is at least your own, and a true one.&rsquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Of course I feel quite certain of that,&rsquo; said Martin, &lsquo;or I shouldn&rsquo;t
      have put myself in my present position. And don&rsquo;t say a poor heart, Mary,
      for I say a rich one. Now, I am about to break a design to you, dearest,
      which will startle you at first, but which is undertaken for your sake. I
      am going,&rsquo; he added slowly, looking far into the deep wonder of her bright
      dark eyes, &lsquo;abroad.&rsquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Abroad, Martin!&rsquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Only to America. See now. How you droop directly!&rsquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;If I do, or, I hope I may say, if I did,&rsquo; she answered, raising her head
      after a short silence, and looking once more into his face, &lsquo;it was for
      grief to think of what you are resolved to undergo for me. I would not
      venture to dissuade you, Martin; but it is a long, long distance; there is
      a wide ocean to be crossed; illness and want are sad calamities in any
      place, but in a foreign country dreadful to endure. Have you thought of
      all this?&rsquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Thought of it!&rsquo; cried Martin, abating, in his fondness&mdash;and he <i>was</i>
      very fond of her&mdash;hardly an iota of his usual impetuosity. &lsquo;What am I
      to do? It&rsquo;s very well to say, &ldquo;Have I thought of it?&rdquo; my love; but you
      should ask me in the same breath, have I thought of starving at home; have
      I thought of doing porter&rsquo;s work for a living; have I thought of holding
      horses in the streets to earn my roll of bread from day to day? Come,
      come,&rsquo; he added, in a gentler tone, &lsquo;do not hang down your head, my dear,
      for I need the encouragement that your sweet face alone can give me. Why,
      that&rsquo;s well! Now you are brave again.&rsquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;I am endeavouring to be,&rsquo; she answered, smiling through her tears.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Endeavouring to be anything that&rsquo;s good, and being it, is, with you, all
      one. Don&rsquo;t I know that of old?&rsquo; cried Martin, gayly. &lsquo;So! That&rsquo;s famous!
      Now I can tell you all my plans as cheerfully as if you were my little
      wife already, Mary.&rsquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      She hung more closely on his arm, and looking upwards in his face, bade
      him speak on.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;You see,&rsquo; said Martin, playing with the little hand upon his wrist, &lsquo;that
      my attempts to advance myself at home have been baffled and rendered
      abortive. I will not say by whom, Mary, for that would give pain to us
      both. But so it is. Have you heard him speak of late of any relative of
      mine or his, called Pecksniff? Only tell me what I ask you, no more.&rsquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;I have heard, to my surprise, that he is a better man than was supposed.&rsquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;I thought so,&rsquo; interrupted Martin.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;And that it is likely we may come to know him, if not to visit and reside
      with him and&mdash;I think&mdash;his daughters. He <i>has </i>daughters, has he,
      love?&rsquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;A pair of them,&rsquo; Martin answered. &lsquo;A precious pair! Gems of the first
      water!&rsquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Ah! You are jesting!&rsquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;There is a sort of jesting which is very much in earnest, and includes
      some pretty serious disgust,&rsquo; said Martin. &lsquo;I jest in reference to Mr
      Pecksniff (at whose house I have been living as his assistant, and at
      whose hands I have received insult and injury), in that vein. Whatever
      betides, or however closely you may be brought into communication with
      this family, never forget that, Mary; and never for an instant, whatever
      appearances may seem to contradict me, lose sight of this assurance&mdash;Pecksniff
      is a scoundrel.&rsquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Indeed!&rsquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;In thought, and in deed, and in everything else. A scoundrel from the
      topmost hair of his head, to the nethermost atom of his heel. Of his
      daughters I will only say that, to the best of my knowledge and belief,
      they are dutiful young ladies, and take after their father closely. This
      is a digression from the main point, and yet it brings me to what I was
      going to say.&rsquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      He stopped to look into her eyes again, and seeing, in a hasty glance over
      his shoulder, that there was no one near, and that Mark was still intent
      upon the fog, not only looked at her lips, too, but kissed them into the
      bargain.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Now I am going to America, with great prospects of doing well, and of
      returning home myself very soon; it may be to take you there for a few
      years, but, at all events, to claim you for my wife; which, after such
      trials, I should do with no fear of your still thinking it a duty to
      cleave to him who will not suffer me to live (for this is true), if he can
      help it, in my own land. How long I may be absent is, of course,
      uncertain; but it shall not be very long. Trust me for that.&rsquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;In the meantime, dear Martin&mdash;&rsquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;That&rsquo;s the very thing I am coming to. In the meantime you shall hear,
      constantly, of all my goings-on. Thus.&rsquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      He paused to take from his pocket the letter he had written overnight, and
      then resumed:
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;In this fellow&rsquo;s employment, and living in this fellow&rsquo;s house (by
      fellow, I mean Mr Pecksniff, of course), there is a certain person of the
      name of Pinch. Don&rsquo;t forget; a poor, strange, simple oddity, Mary; but
      thoroughly honest and sincere; full of zeal; and with a cordial regard for
      me. Which I mean to return one of these days, by setting him up in life in
      some way or other.&rsquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Your old kind nature, Martin!&rsquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Oh!&rsquo; said Martin, &lsquo;that&rsquo;s not worth speaking of, my love. He&rsquo;s very
      grateful and desirous to serve me; and I am more than repaid. Now one
      night I told this Pinch my history, and all about myself and you; in which
      he was not a little interested, I can tell you, for he knows you! Aye, you
      may look surprised&mdash;and the longer the better for it becomes you&mdash;but
      you have heard him play the organ in the church of that village before
      now; and he has seen you listening to his music; and has caught his
      inspiration from you, too!&rsquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Was <i>he</i> the organist?&rsquo; cried Mary. &lsquo;I thank him from my heart!&rsquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Yes, he was,&rsquo; said Martin, &lsquo;and is, and gets nothing for it either. There
      never was such a simple fellow! Quite an infant! But a very good sort of
      creature, I assure you.&rsquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;I am sure of that,&rsquo; she said with great earnestness. &lsquo;He must be!&rsquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Oh, yes, no doubt at all about it,&rsquo; rejoined Martin, in his usual
      careless way. &lsquo;He is. Well! It has occurred to me&mdash;but stay. If I
      read you what I have written and intend sending to him by post to-night it
      will explain itself. &ldquo;My dear Tom Pinch.&rdquo; That&rsquo;s rather familiar perhaps,&rsquo;
      said Martin, suddenly remembering that he was proud when they had last
      met, &lsquo;but I call him my dear Tom Pinch because he likes it, and it pleases
      him.&rsquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Very right, and very kind,&rsquo; said Mary.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Exactly so!&rsquo; cried Martin. &lsquo;It&rsquo;s as well to be kind whenever one can;
      and, as I said before, he really is an excellent fellow. &ldquo;My dear Tom
      Pinch&mdash;I address this under cover to Mrs Lupin, at the Blue Dragon,
      and have begged her in a short note to deliver it to you without saying
      anything about it elsewhere; and to do the same with all future letters
      she may receive from me. My reason for so doing will be at once apparent
      to you&rdquo;&mdash;I don&rsquo;t know that it will be, by the bye,&rsquo; said Martin,
      breaking off, &lsquo;for he&rsquo;s slow of comprehension, poor fellow; but he&rsquo;ll find
      it out in time. My reason simply is, that I don&rsquo;t want my letters to be
      read by other people; and particularly by the scoundrel whom he thinks an
      angel.&rsquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Mr Pecksniff again?&rsquo; asked Mary.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;The same,&rsquo; said Martin &lsquo;&mdash;will be at once apparent to you. I have
      completed my arrangements for going to America; and you will be surprised
      to hear that I am to be accompanied by Mark Tapley, upon whom I have
      stumbled strangely in London, and who insists on putting himself under my
      protection&rsquo;&mdash;meaning, my love,&rsquo; said Martin, breaking off again, &lsquo;our
      friend in the rear, of course.&rsquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      She was delighted to hear this, and bestowed a kind glance upon Mark,
      which he brought his eyes down from the fog to encounter and received with
      immense satisfaction. She said in his hearing, too, that he was a good
      soul and a merry creature, and would be faithful, she was certain;
      commendations which Mr Tapley inwardly resolved to deserve, from such
      lips, if he died for it.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;&ldquo;Now, my dear Pinch,&rdquo;&rsquo; resumed Martin, proceeding with his letter; &lsquo;&ldquo;I am
      going to repose great trust in you, knowing that I may do so with perfect
      reliance on your honour and secrecy, and having nobody else just now to
      trust in.&rdquo;&rsquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;I don&rsquo;t think I would say that, Martin.&rsquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Wouldn&rsquo;t you? Well! I&rsquo;ll take that out. It&rsquo;s perfectly true, though.&rsquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;But it might seem ungracious, perhaps.&rsquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Oh, I don&rsquo;t mind Pinch,&rsquo; said Martin. &lsquo;There&rsquo;s no occasion to stand on
      any ceremony with <i>him</i>. However, I&rsquo;ll take it out, as you wish it, and make
      the full stop at &ldquo;secrecy.&rdquo; Very well! &ldquo;I shall not only&rdquo;&mdash;this is
      the letter again, you know.&rsquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;I understand.&rsquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;&ldquo;I shall not only enclose my letters to the young lady of whom I have
      told you, to your charge, to be forwarded as she may request; but I most
      earnestly commit her, the young lady herself, to your care and regard, in
      the event of your meeting in my absence. I have reason to think that the
      probabilities of your encountering each other&mdash;perhaps very
      frequently&mdash;are now neither remote nor few; and although in our
      position you can do very little to lessen the uneasiness of hers, I trust
      to you implicitly to do that much, and so deserve the confidence I have
      reposed in you.&rdquo; You see, my dear Mary,&rsquo; said Martin, &lsquo;it will be a great
      consolation to you to have anybody, no matter how simple, with whom you
      can speak about <i>me</i>; and the very first time you talk to Pinch, you&rsquo;ll feel
      at once that there is no more occasion for any embarrassment or hesitation
      in talking to him, than if he were an old woman.&rsquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;However that may be,&rsquo; she returned, smiling, &lsquo;he is your friend, and that
      is enough.&rsquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Oh, yes, he&rsquo;s my friend,&rsquo; said Martin, &lsquo;certainly. In fact, I have told
      him in so many words that we&rsquo;ll always take notice of him, and protect
      him; and it&rsquo;s a good trait in his character that he&rsquo;s grateful&mdash;very
      grateful indeed. You&rsquo;ll like him of all things, my love, I know. You&rsquo;ll
      observe very much that&rsquo;s comical and old-fashioned about Pinch, but you
      needn&rsquo;t mind laughing at him; for he&rsquo;ll not care about it. He&rsquo;ll rather
      like it indeed!&rsquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;I don&rsquo;t think I shall put that to the test, Martin.&rsquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;You won&rsquo;t if you can help it, of course,&rsquo; he said, &lsquo;but I think you&rsquo;ll
      find him a little too much for your gravity. However, that&rsquo;s neither here
      nor there, and it certainly is not the letter; which ends thus: &ldquo;Knowing
      that I need not impress the nature and extent of that confidence upon you
      at any greater length, as it is already sufficiently established in your
      mind, I will only say, in bidding you farewell and looking forward to our
      next meeting, that I shall charge myself from this time, through all
      changes for the better, with your advancement and happiness, as if they
      were my own. You may rely upon that. And always believe me, my dear Tom
      Pinch, faithfully your friend, Martin Chuzzlewit. P.S.&mdash;I enclose the
      amount which you so kindly&rdquo;&mdash;Oh,&rsquo; said Martin, checking himself, and
      folding up the letter, &lsquo;that&rsquo;s nothing!&rsquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      At this crisis Mark Tapley interposed, with an apology for remarking that
      the clock at the Horse Guards was striking.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Which I shouldn&rsquo;t have said nothing about, sir,&rsquo; added Mark, &lsquo;if the
      young lady hadn&rsquo;t begged me to be particular in mentioning it.&rsquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;I did,&rsquo; said Mary. &lsquo;Thank you. You are quite right. In another minute I
      shall be ready to return. We have time for a very few words more, dear
      Martin, and although I had much to say, it must remain unsaid until the
      happy time of our next meeting. Heaven send it may come speedily and
      prosperously! But I have no fear of that.&rsquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Fear!&rsquo; cried Martin. &lsquo;Why, who has? What are a few months? What is a
      whole year? When I come gayly back, with a road through life hewn out
      before me, then indeed, looking back upon this parting, it may seem a
      dismal one. But now! I swear I wouldn&rsquo;t have it happen under more
      favourable auspices, if I could; for then I should be less inclined to go,
      and less impressed with the necessity.&rsquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Yes, yes. I feel that too. When do you go?&rsquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;To-night. We leave for Liverpool to-night. A vessel sails from that port,
      as I hear, in three days. In a month, or less, we shall be there. Why,
      what&rsquo;s a month! How many months have flown by, since our last parting!&rsquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Long to look back upon,&rsquo; said Mary, echoing his cheerful tone, &lsquo;but
      nothing in their course!&rsquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Nothing at all!&rsquo; cried Martin. &lsquo;I shall have change of scene and change
      of place; change of people, change of manners, change of cares and hopes!
      Time will wear wings indeed! I can bear anything, so that I have swift
      action, Mary.&rsquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      Was he thinking solely of her care for him, when he took so little heed of
      her share in the separation; of her quiet monotonous endurance, and her
      slow anxiety from day to day? Was there nothing jarring and discordant
      even in his tone of courage, with this one note &lsquo;self&rsquo; for ever audible,
      however high the strain? Not in her ears. It had been better otherwise,
      perhaps, but so it was. She heard the same bold spirit which had flung
      away as dross all gain and profit for her sake, making light of peril and
      privation that she might be calm and happy; and she heard no more. That
      heart where self has found no place and raised no throne, is slow to
      recognize its ugly presence when it looks upon it. As one possessed of an
      evil spirit was held in old time to be alone conscious of the lurking
      demon in the breasts of other men, so kindred vices know each other in
      their hiding-places every day, when Virtue is incredulous and blind.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;The quarter&rsquo;s gone!&rsquo; cried Mr Tapley, in a voice of admonition.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;I shall be ready to return immediately,&rsquo; she said. &lsquo;One thing, dear
      Martin, I am bound to tell you. You entreated me a few minutes since only
      to answer what you asked me in reference to one theme, but you should and
      must know (otherwise I could not be at ease) that since that separation of
      which I was the unhappy occasion, he has never once uttered your name; has
      never coupled it, or any faint allusion to it, with passion or reproach;
      and has never abated in his kindness to me.&rsquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;I thank him for that last act,&rsquo; said Martin, &lsquo;and for nothing else.
      Though on consideration I may thank him for his other forbearance also,
      inasmuch as I neither expect nor desire that he will mention my name
      again. He may once, perhaps&mdash;to couple it with reproach&mdash;in his
      will. Let him, if he please! By the time it reaches me, he will be in his
      grave; a satire on his own anger, God help him!&rsquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Martin! If you would but sometimes, in some quiet hour; beside the winter
      fire; in the summer air; when you hear gentle music, or think of Death, or
      Home, or Childhood; if you would at such a season resolve to think, but
      once a month, or even once a year, of him, or any one who ever wronged
      you, you would forgive him in your heart, I know!&rsquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;If I believed that to be true, Mary,&rsquo; he replied, &lsquo;I would resolve at no
      such time to bear him in my mind; wishing to spare myself the shame of
      such a weakness. I was not born to be the toy and puppet of any man, far
      less his; to whose pleasure and caprice, in return for any good he did me,
      my whole youth was sacrificed. It became between us two a fair exchange&mdash;a
      barter&mdash;and no more; and there is no such balance against me that I
      need throw in a mawkish forgiveness to poise the scale. He has forbidden
      all mention of me to you, I know,&rsquo; he added hastily. &lsquo;Come! Has he not?&rsquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;That was long ago,&rsquo; she returned; &lsquo;immediately after your parting; before
      you had left the house. He has never done so since.&rsquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;He has never done so since because he has seen no occasion,&rsquo; said Martin;
      &lsquo;but that is of little consequence, one way or other. Let all allusion to
      him between you and me be interdicted from this time forth. And therefore,
      love&rsquo;&mdash;he drew her quickly to him, for the time of parting had now
      come&mdash;&lsquo;in the first letter that you write to me through the Post
      Office, addressed to New York; and in all the others that you send through
      Pinch; remember he has no existence, but has become to us as one who is
      dead. Now, God bless you! This is a strange place for such a meeting and
      such a parting; but our next meeting shall be in a better, and our next
      and last parting in a worse.&rsquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;One other question, Martin, I must ask. Have you provided money for this
      journey?&rsquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Have I?&rsquo; cried Martin; it might have been in his pride; it might have
      been in his desire to set her mind at ease: &lsquo;Have I provided money? Why,
      there&rsquo;s a question for an emigrant&rsquo;s wife! How could I move on land or sea
      without it, love?&rsquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;I mean, enough.&rsquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Enough! More than enough. Twenty times more than enough. A pocket-full.
      Mark and I, for all essential ends, are quite as rich as if we had the
      purse of Fortunatus in our baggage.&rsquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;The half-hour&rsquo;s a-going!&rsquo; cried Mr Tapley.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Good-bye a hundred times!&rsquo; cried Mary, in a trembling voice.
    </p>
    <p>
      But how cold the comfort in Good-bye! Mark Tapley knew it perfectly.
      Perhaps he knew it from his reading, perhaps from his experience, perhaps
      from intuition. It is impossible to say; but however he knew it, his
      knowledge instinctively suggested to him the wisest course of proceeding
      that any man could have adopted under the circumstances. He was taken with
      a violent fit of sneezing, and was obliged to turn his head another way.
      In doing which, he, in a manner fenced and screened the lovers into a
      corner by themselves.
    </p>
    <p>
      There was a short pause, but Mark had an undefined sensation that it was a
      satisfactory one in its way. Then Mary, with her veil lowered, passed him
      with a quick step, and beckoned him to follow. She stopped once more
      before they lost that corner; looked back; and waved her hand to Martin.
      He made a start towards them at the moment as if he had some other
      farewell words to say; but she only hurried off the faster, and Mr Tapley
      followed as in duty bound.
    </p>
    <p>
      When he rejoined Martin again in his own chamber, he found that gentleman
      seated moodily before the dusty grate, with his two feet on the fender,
      his two elbows on his knees, and his chin supported, in a not very
      ornamental manner, on the palms of his hands.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Well, Mark!&rsquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Well, sir,&rsquo; said Mark, taking a long breath, &lsquo;I see the young lady safe
      home, and I feel pretty comfortable after it. She sent a lot of kind
      words, sir, and this,&rsquo; handing him a ring, &lsquo;for a parting keepsake.&rsquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Diamonds!&rsquo; said Martin, kissing it&mdash;let us do him justice, it was
      for her sake; not for theirs&mdash;and putting it on his little finger.
      &lsquo;Splendid diamonds! My grandfather is a singular character, Mark. He must
      have given her this now.&rsquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      Mark Tapley knew as well that she had bought it, to the end that that
      unconscious speaker might carry some article of sterling value with him in
      his necessity; as he knew that it was day, and not night. Though he had no
      more acquaintance of his own knowledge with the history of the glittering
      trinket on Martin&rsquo;s outspread finger, than Martin himself had, he was as
      certain that in its purchase she had expended her whole stock of hoarded
      money, as if he had seen it paid down coin by coin. Her lover&rsquo;s strange
      obtuseness in relation to this little incident, promptly suggested to
      Mark&rsquo;s mind its real cause and root; and from that moment he had a clear
      and perfect insight into the one absorbing principle of Martin&rsquo;s
      character.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;She is worthy of the sacrifices I have made,&rsquo; said Martin, folding his
      arms, and looking at the ashes in the stove, as if in resumption of some
      former thoughts. &lsquo;Well worthy of them. No riches&rsquo;&mdash;here he stroked
      his chin and mused&mdash;&lsquo;could have compensated for the loss of such a
      nature. Not to mention that in gaining her affection I have followed the
      bent of my own wishes, and baulked the selfish schemes of others who had
      no right to form them. She is quite worthy&mdash;more than worthy&mdash;of
      the sacrifices I have made. Yes, she is. No doubt of it.&rsquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      These ruminations might or might not have reached Mark Tapley; for though
      they were by no means addressed to him, yet they were softly uttered. In
      any case, he stood there, watching Martin with an indescribable and most
      involved expression on his visage, until that young man roused himself and
      looked towards him; when he turned away, as being suddenly intent upon
      certain preparations for the journey, and, without giving vent to any
      articulate sound, smiled with surpassing ghastliness, and seemed by a
      twist of his features and a motion of his lips, to release himself of this
      word:
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Jolly!&rsquo;

      CHAPTER FIFTEEN
    </h2>
    <h3>
      THE BURDEN WHEREOF, IS HAIL COLUMBIA!
    </h3>
    <p>
      A dark and dreary night; people nestling in their beds or circling late
      about the fire; Want, colder than Charity, shivering at the street
      corners; church-towers humming with the faint vibration of their own
      tongues, but newly resting from the ghostly preachment &lsquo;One!&rsquo; The earth
      covered with a sable pall as for the burial of yesterday; the clumps of
      dark trees, its giant plumes of funeral feathers, waving sadly to and fro:
      all hushed, all noiseless, and in deep repose, save the swift clouds that
      skim across the moon, and the cautious wind, as, creeping after them upon
      the ground, it stops to listen, and goes rustling on, and stops again, and
      follows, like a savage on the trail.
    </p>
    <p>
      Whither go the clouds and wind so eagerly? If, like guilty spirits, they
      repair to some dread conference with powers like themselves, in what wild
      regions do the elements hold council, or where unbend in terrible disport?
    </p>
    <p>
      Here! Free from that cramped prison called the earth, and out upon the
      waste of waters. Here, roaring, raging, shrieking, howling, all night
      long. Hither come the sounding voices from the caverns on the coast of
      that small island, sleeping, a thousand miles away, so quietly in the
      midst of angry waves; and hither, to meet them, rush the blasts from
      unknown desert places of the world. Here, in the fury of their unchecked
      liberty, they storm and buffet with each other, until the sea, lashed into
      passion like their own, leaps up, in ravings mightier than theirs, and the
      whole scene is madness.
    </p>
    <p>
      On, on, on, over the countless miles of angry space roll the long heaving
      billows. Mountains and caves are here, and yet are not; for what is now
      the one, is now the other; then all is but a boiling heap of rushing
      water. Pursuit, and flight, and mad return of wave on wave, and savage
      struggle, ending in a spouting-up of foam that whitens the black night;
      incessant change of place, and form, and hue; constancy in nothing, but
      eternal strife; on, on, on, they roll, and darker grows the night, and
      louder howls the wind, and more clamorous and fierce become the million
      voices in the sea, when the wild cry goes forth upon the storm &lsquo;A ship!&rsquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      Onward she comes, in gallant combat with the elements, her tall masts
      trembling, and her timbers starting on the strain; onward she comes, now
      high upon the curling billows, now low down in the hollows of the sea, as
      hiding for the moment from its fury; and every storm-voice in the air and
      water cries more loudly yet, &lsquo;A ship!&rsquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      Still she comes striving on; and at her boldness and the spreading cry,
      the angry waves rise up above each other&rsquo;s hoary heads to look; and round
      about the vessel, far as the mariners on the decks can pierce into the
      gloom, they press upon her, forcing each other down and starting up, and
      rushing forward from afar, in dreadful curiosity. High over her they
      break; and round her surge and roar; and giving place to others, moaningly
      depart, and dash themselves to fragments in their baffled anger. Still she
      comes onward bravely. And though the eager multitude crowd thick and fast
      upon her all the night, and dawn of day discovers the untiring train yet
      bearing down upon the ship in an eternity of troubled water, onward she
      comes, with dim lights burning in her hull, and people there, asleep; as
      if no deadly element were peering in at every seam and chink, and no
      drowned seaman&rsquo;s grave, with but a plank to cover it, were yawning in the
      unfathomable depths below.
    </p>
    <p>
      Among these sleeping voyagers were Martin and Mark Tapley, who, rocked
      into a heavy drowsiness by the unaccustomed motion, were as insensible to
      the foul air in which they lay, as to the uproar without. It was broad day
      when the latter awoke with a dim idea that he was dreaming of having gone
      to sleep in a four-post bedstead which had turned bottom upwards in the
      course of the night. There was more reason in this too, than in the
      roasting of eggs; for the first objects Mr Tapley recognized when he
      opened his eyes were his own heels&mdash;looking down to him, as he
      afterwards observed, from a nearly perpendicular elevation.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Well!&rsquo; said Mark, getting himself into a sitting posture, after various
      ineffectual struggles with the rolling of the ship. &lsquo;This is the first
      time as ever I stood on my head all night.&rsquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;You shouldn&rsquo;t go to sleep upon the ground with your head to leeward
      then,&rsquo; growled a man in one of the berths.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;With my head to <i>where</i>?&rsquo; asked Mark.
    </p>
    <p>
      The man repeated his previous sentiment.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;No, I won&rsquo;t another time,&rsquo; said Mark, &lsquo;when I know whereabouts on the map
      that country is. In the meanwhile I can give you a better piece of advice.
      Don&rsquo;t you nor any other friend of mine never go to sleep with his head in
      a ship any more.&rsquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      The man gave a grunt of discontented acquiescence, turned over in his
      berth, and drew his blanket over his head.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;&mdash;For,&rsquo; said Mr Tapley, pursuing the theme by way of soliloquy in a
      low tone of voice; &lsquo;the sea is as nonsensical a thing as any going. It
      never knows what to do with itself. It hasn&rsquo;t got no employment for its
      mind, and is always in a state of vacancy. Like them Polar bears in the
      wild-beast shows as is constantly a-nodding their heads from side to side,
      it never <i>can </i>be quiet. Which is entirely owing to its uncommon stupidity.&rsquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Is that you, Mark?&rsquo; asked a faint voice from another berth.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;It&rsquo;s as much of me as is left, sir, after a fortnight of this work,&rsquo; Mr
      Tapley replied, &lsquo;What with leading the life of a fly, ever since I&rsquo;ve been
      aboard&mdash;for I&rsquo;ve been perpetually holding-on to something or other in
      a upside-down position&mdash;what with that, sir, and putting a very
      little into myself, and taking a good deal out of myself, there an&rsquo;t too
      much of me to swear by. How do you find yourself this morning, sir?&rsquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Very miserable,&rsquo; said Martin, with a peevish groan. &lsquo;Ugh. This is
      wretched, indeed!&rsquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Creditable,&rsquo; muttered Mark, pressing one hand upon his aching head and
      looking round him with a rueful grin. &lsquo;That&rsquo;s the great comfort. It <i>is</i>
      creditable to keep up one&rsquo;s spirits here. Virtue&rsquo;s its own reward. So&rsquo;s
      jollity.&rsquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      Mark was so far right that unquestionably any man who retained his
      cheerfulness among the steerage accommodations of that noble and
      fast-sailing line-of-packet ship, &lsquo;<i>The Screw</i>,&rsquo; was solely indebted to his
      own resources, and shipped his good humour, like his provisions, without
      any contribution or assistance from the owners. A dark, low, stifling
      cabin, surrounded by berths all filled to overflowing with men, women, and
      children, in various stages of sickness and misery, is not the liveliest
      place of assembly at any time; but when it is so crowded (as the steerage
      cabin of the Screw was, every passage out), that mattresses and beds are
      heaped upon the floor, to the extinction of everything like comfort,
      cleanliness, and decency, it is liable to operate not only as a pretty
      strong banner against amiability of temper, but as a positive encourager
      of selfish and rough humours. Mark felt this, as he sat looking about him;
      and his spirits rose proportionately.
    </p>
    <p>
      There were English people, Irish people, Welsh people, and Scotch people
      there; all with their little store of coarse food and shabby clothes; and
      nearly all with their families of children. There were children of all
      ages; from the baby at the breast, to the slattern-girl who was as much a
      grown woman as her mother. Every kind of domestic suffering that is bred
      in poverty, illness, banishment, sorrow, and long travel in bad weather,
      was crammed into the little space; and yet was there infinitely less of
      complaint and querulousness, and infinitely more of mutual assistance and
      general kindness to be found in that unwholesome ark, than in many
      brilliant ballrooms.
    </p>
    <p>
      Mark looked about him wistfully, and his face brightened as he looked.
      Here an old grandmother was crooning over a sick child, and rocking it to
      and fro, in arms hardly more wasted than its own young limbs; here a poor
      woman with an infant in her lap, mended another little creature&rsquo;s clothes,
      and quieted another who was creeping up about her from their scanty bed
      upon the floor. Here were old men awkwardly engaged in little household
      offices, wherein they would have been ridiculous but for their good-will
      and kind purpose; and here were swarthy fellows&mdash;giants in their way&mdash;doing
      such little acts of tenderness for those about them, as might have
      belonged to gentlest-hearted dwarfs. The very idiot in the corner who sat
      mowing there, all day, had his faculty of imitation roused by what he saw
      about him; and snapped his fingers to amuse a crying child.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Now, then,&rsquo; said Mark, nodding to a woman who was dressing her three
      children at no great distance from him&mdash;and the grin upon his face
      had by this time spread from ear to ear&mdash;&lsquo;Hand over one of them young
      &lsquo;uns according to custom.&rsquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;I wish you&rsquo;d get breakfast, Mark, instead of worrying with people who
      don&rsquo;t belong to you,&rsquo; observed Martin, petulantly.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;All right,&rsquo; said Mark. &lsquo;<i>She&rsquo;ll</i> do that. It&rsquo;s a fair division of labour,
      sir. I wash her boys, and she makes our tea. I never <i>could </i>make tea, but
      any one can wash a boy.&rsquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      The woman, who was delicate and ill, felt and understood his kindness, as
      well she might, for she had been covered every night with his greatcoat,
      while he had for his own bed the bare boards and a rug. But Martin, who
      seldom got up or looked about him, was quite incensed by the folly of this
      speech, and expressed his dissatisfaction by an impatient groan.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;So it is, certainly,&rsquo; said Mark, brushing the child&rsquo;s hair as coolly as
      if he had been born and bred a barber.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;What are you talking about, now?&rsquo; asked Martin.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;What you said,&rsquo; replied Mark; &lsquo;or what you meant, when you gave that
      there dismal vent to your feelings. I quite go along with it, sir. It <i>is</i>
      very hard upon her.&rsquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;What is?&rsquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Making the voyage by herself along with these young impediments here, and
      going such a way at such a time of the year to join her husband. If you
      don&rsquo;t want to be driven mad with yellow soap in your eye, young man,&rsquo; said
      Mr Tapley to the second urchin, who was by this time under his hands at
      the basin, &lsquo;you&rsquo;d better shut it.&rsquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Where does she join her husband?&rsquo; asked Martin, yawning.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Why, I&rsquo;m very much afraid,&rsquo; said Mr Tapley, in a low voice, &lsquo;that she
      don&rsquo;t know. I hope she mayn&rsquo;t miss him. But she sent her last letter by
      hand, and it don&rsquo;t seem to have been very clearly understood between &lsquo;em
      without it, and if she don&rsquo;t see him a-waving his pocket-handkerchief on
      the shore, like a pictur out of a song-book, my opinion is, she&rsquo;ll break
      her heart.&rsquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Why, how, in Folly&rsquo;s name, does the woman come to be on board ship on
      such a wild-goose venture!&rsquo; cried Martin.
    </p>
    <p>
      Mr Tapley glanced at him for a moment as he lay prostrate in his berth,
      and then said, very quietly:
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Ah! How indeed! I can&rsquo;t think! He&rsquo;s been away from her for two year;
      she&rsquo;s been very poor and lonely in her own country; and has always been
      a-looking forward to meeting him. It&rsquo;s very strange she should be here.
      Quite amazing! A little mad perhaps! There can&rsquo;t be no other way of
      accounting for it.&rsquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      Martin was too far gone in the lassitude of sea-sickness to make any reply
      to these words, or even to attend to them as they were spoken. And the
      subject of their discourse returning at this crisis with some hot tea,
      effectually put a stop to any resumption of the theme by Mr Tapley; who,
      when the meal was over and he had adjusted Martin&rsquo;s bed, went up on deck
      to wash the breakfast service, which consisted of two half-pint tin mugs,
      and a shaving-pot of the same metal.
    </p>
    <p>
      It is due to Mark Tapley to state that he suffered at least as much from
      sea-sickness as any man, woman, or child, on board; and that he had a
      peculiar faculty of knocking himself about on the smallest provocation,
      and losing his legs at every lurch of the ship. But resolved, in his usual
      phrase, to &lsquo;come out strong&rsquo; under disadvantageous circumstances, he was
      the life and soul of the steerage, and made no more of stopping in the
      middle of a facetious conversation to go away and be excessively ill by
      himself, and afterwards come back in the very best and gayest of tempers
      to resume it, than if such a course of proceeding had been the commonest
      in the world.
    </p>
    <p>
      It cannot be said that as his illness wore off, his cheerfulness and good
      nature increased, because they would hardly admit of augmentation; but his
      usefulness among the weaker members of the party was much enlarged; and at
      all times and seasons there he was exerting it. If a gleam of sun shone
      out of the dark sky, down Mark tumbled into the cabin, and presently up he
      came again with a woman in his arms, or half-a-dozen children, or a man,
      or a bed, or a saucepan, or a basket, or something animate or inanimate,
      that he thought would be the better for the air. If an hour or two of fine
      weather in the middle of the day tempted those who seldom or never came on
      deck at other times to crawl into the long-boat, or lie down upon the
      spare spars, and try to eat, there, in the centre of the group, was Mr
      Tapley, handing about salt beef and biscuit, or dispensing tastes of grog,
      or cutting up the children&rsquo;s provisions with his pocketknife, for their
      greater ease and comfort, or reading aloud from a venerable newspaper, or
      singing some roaring old song to a select party, or writing the beginnings
      of letters to their friends at home for people who couldn&rsquo;t write, or
      cracking jokes with the crew, or nearly getting blown over the side, or
      emerging, half-drowned, from a shower of spray, or lending a hand
      somewhere or other; but always doing something for the general
      entertainment. At night, when the cooking-fire was lighted on the deck,
      and the driving sparks that flew among the rigging, and the clouds of
      sails, seemed to menace the ship with certain annihilation by fire, in
      case the elements of air and water failed to compass her destruction;
      there, again, was Mr Tapley, with his coat off and his shirt-sleeves
      turned up to his elbows, doing all kinds of culinary offices; compounding
      the strangest dishes; recognized by every one as an established authority;
      and helping all parties to achieve something which, left to themselves,
      they never could have done, and never would have dreamed of. In short,
      there never was a more popular character than Mark Tapley became, on board
      that noble and fast-sailing line-of-packet ship, the Screw; and he
      attained at last to such a pitch of universal admiration, that he began to
      have grave doubts within himself whether a man might reasonably claim any
      credit for being jolly under such exciting circumstances.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;If this was going to last,&rsquo; said Tapley, &lsquo;there&rsquo;d be no great difference
      as I can perceive, between the Screw and the Dragon. I never am to get
      credit, I think. I begin to be afraid that the Fates is determined to make
      the world easy to me.&rsquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Well, Mark,&rsquo; said Martin, near whose berth he had ruminated to this
      effect. &lsquo;When will this be over?&rsquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Another week, they say, sir,&rsquo; returned Mark, &lsquo;will most likely bring us
      into port. The ship&rsquo;s a-going along at present, as sensible as a ship can,
      sir; though I don&rsquo;t mean to say as that&rsquo;s any very high praise.&rsquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;I don&rsquo;t think it is, indeed,&rsquo; groaned Martin.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;You&rsquo;d feel all the better for it, sir, if you was to turn out,&rsquo; observed
      Mark.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;And be seen by the ladies and gentlemen on the after-deck,&rsquo; returned
      Martin, with a scronful emphasis upon the words, &lsquo;mingling with the
      beggarly crowd that are stowed away in this vile hole. I should be greatly
      the better for that, no doubt.&rsquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;I&rsquo;m thankful that I can&rsquo;t say from my own experience what the feelings of
      a gentleman may be,&rsquo; said Mark, &lsquo;but I should have thought, sir, as a
      gentleman would feel a deal more uncomfortable down here than up in the
      fresh air, especially when the ladies and gentlemen in the after-cabin
      know just as much about him as he does about them, and are likely to
      trouble their heads about him in the same proportion. I should have
      thought that, certainly.&rsquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;I tell you, then,&rsquo; rejoined Martin, &lsquo;you would have thought wrong, and do
      think wrong.&rsquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Very likely, sir,&rsquo; said Mark, with imperturbable good temper. &lsquo;I often
      do.&rsquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;As to lying here,&rsquo; cried Martin, raising himself on his elbow, and
      looking angrily at his follower. &lsquo;Do you suppose it&rsquo;s a pleasure to lie
      here?&rsquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;All the madhouses in the world,&rsquo; said Mr Tapley, &lsquo;couldn&rsquo;t produce such a
      maniac as the man must be who could think that.&rsquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Then why are you forever goading and urging me to get up?&rsquo; asked Martin,
      &lsquo;I lie here because I don&rsquo;t wish to be recognized, in the better days to
      which I aspire, by any purse-proud citizen, as the man who came over with
      him among the steerage passengers. I lie here because I wish to conceal my
      circumstances and myself, and not to arrive in a new world badged and
      ticketed as an utterly poverty-stricken man. If I could have afforded a
      passage in the after-cabin I should have held up my head with the rest. As
      I couldn&rsquo;t I hide it. Do you understand that?&rsquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;I am very sorry, sir,&rsquo; said Mark. &lsquo;I didn&rsquo;t know you took it so much to
      heart as this comes to.&rsquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Of course you didn&rsquo;t know,&rsquo; returned his master. &lsquo;How should you know,
      unless I told you? It&rsquo;s no trial to you, Mark, to make yourself
      comfortable and to bustle about. It&rsquo;s as natural for you to do so under
      the circumstances as it is for me not to do so. Why, you don&rsquo;t suppose
      there is a living creature in this ship who can by possibility have half
      so much to undergo on board of her as I have? Do you?&rsquo; he asked, sitting
      upright in his berth and looking at Mark, with an expression of great
      earnestness not unmixed with wonder.
    </p>
    <p>
      Mark twisted his face into a tight knot, and with his head very much on
      one side, pondered upon this question as if he felt it an extremely
      difficult one to answer. He was relieved from his embarrassment by Martin
      himself, who said, as he stretched himself upon his back again and resumed
      the book he had been reading:
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;But what is the use of my putting such a case to you, when the very
      essence of what I have been saying is, that you cannot by possibility
      understand it! Make me a little brandy-and-water&mdash;cold and very weak&mdash;and
      give me a biscuit, and tell your friend, who is a nearer neighbour of ours
      than I could wish, to try and keep her children a little quieter to-night
      than she did last night; that&rsquo;s a good fellow.&rsquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      Mr Tapley set himself to obey these orders with great alacrity, and
      pending their execution, it may be presumed his flagging spirits revived;
      inasmuch as he several times observed, below his breath, that in respect
      of its power of imparting a credit to jollity, the Screw unquestionably
      had some decided advantages over the Dragon. He also remarked that it was
      a high gratification to him to reflect that he would carry its main
      excellence ashore with him, and have it constantly beside him wherever he
      went; but what he meant by these consolatory thoughts he did not explain.
    </p>
    <p>
      And now a general excitement began to prevail on board; and various
      predictions relative to the precise day, and even the precise hour at
      which they would reach New York, were freely broached. There was
      infinitely more crowding on deck and looking over the ship&rsquo;s side than
      there had been before; and an epidemic broke out for packing up things
      every morning, which required unpacking again every night. Those who had
      any letters to deliver, or any friends to meet, or any settled plans of
      going anywhere or doing anything, discussed their prospects a hundred
      times a day; and as this class of passengers was very small, and the
      number of those who had no prospects whatever was very large, there were
      plenty of listeners and few talkers. Those who had been ill all along, got
      well now, and those who had been well, got better. An American gentleman
      in the after-cabin, who had been wrapped up in fur and oilskin the whole
      passage, unexpectedly appeared in a very shiny, tall, black hat, and
      constantly overhauled a very little valise of pale leather, which
      contained his clothes, linen, brushes, shaving apparatus, books, trinkets,
      and other baggage. He likewise stuck his hands deep into his pockets, and
      walked the deck with his nostrils dilated, as already inhaling the air of
      Freedom which carries death to all tyrants, and can never (under any
      circumstances worth mentioning) be breathed by slaves. An English
      gentleman who was strongly suspected of having run away from a bank, with
      something in his possession belonging to its strong box besides the key,
      grew eloquent upon the subject of the rights of man, and hummed the
      Marseillaise Hymn constantly. In a word, one great sensation pervaded the
      whole ship, and the soil of America lay close before them; so close at
      last, that, upon a certain starlight night they took a pilot on board, and
      within a few hours afterwards lay to until the morning, awaiting the
      arrival of a steamboat in which the passengers were to be conveyed ashore.
    </p>
    <p>
      Off she came, soon after it was light next morning, and lying alongside an
      hour or more&mdash;during which period her very firemen were objects of
      hardly less interest and curiosity than if they had been so many angels,
      good or bad&mdash;took all her living freight aboard. Among them Mark, who
      still had his friend and her three children under his close protection;
      and Martin, who had once more dressed himself in his usual attire, but
      wore a soiled, old cloak above his ordinary clothes, until such time as he
      should separate for ever from his late companions.
    </p>
    <p>
      The steamer&mdash;which, with its machinery on deck, looked, as it worked
      its long slim legs, like some enormously magnified insect or antediluvian
      monster&mdash;dashed at great speed up a beautiful bay; and presently they
      saw some heights, and islands, and a long, flat, straggling city.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;And this,&rsquo; said Mr Tapley, looking far ahead, &lsquo;is the Land of Liberty, is
      it? Very well. I&rsquo;m agreeable. Any land will do for me, after so much
      water!&rsquo;

      CHAPTER SIXTEEN
    </h2>
    <p>
      MARTIN DISEMBARKS FROM THAT NOBLE AND FAST-SAILING LINE-OF-PACKET SHIP,
      &lsquo;THE SCREW&rsquo;, AT THE PORT OF NEW YORK, IN THE UNITED STATES OF AMERICA. HE
      MAKES SOME ACQUAINTANCES, AND DINES AT A BOARDING-HOUSE. THE PARTICULARS
      OF THOSE TRANSACTIONS
    </p>
    <p>
      Some trifling excitement prevailed upon the very brink and margin of the
      land of liberty; for an alderman had been elected the day before; and
      Party Feeling naturally running rather high on such an exciting occasion,
      the friends of the disappointed candidate had found it necessary to assert
      the great principles of Purity of Election and Freedom of opinion by
      breaking a few legs and arms, and furthermore pursuing one obnoxious
      gentleman through the streets with the design of hitting his nose. These
      good-humoured little outbursts of the popular fancy were not in themselves
      sufficiently remarkable to create any great stir, after the lapse of a
      whole night; but they found fresh life and notoriety in the breath of the
      newsboys, who not only proclaimed them with shrill yells in all the
      highways and byways of the town, upon the wharves and among the shipping,
      but on the deck and down in the cabins of the steamboat; which, before she
      touched the shore, was boarded and overrun by a legion of those young
      citizens.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Here&rsquo;s this morning&rsquo;s New York Sewer!&rsquo; cried one. &lsquo;Here&rsquo;s this morning&rsquo;s
      New York Stabber! Here&rsquo;s the New York Family Spy! Here&rsquo;s the New York
      Private Listener! Here&rsquo;s the New York Peeper! Here&rsquo;s the New York

      News. Here they are! Here they are! Here&rsquo;s the papers, here&rsquo;s the papers!&rsquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Here&rsquo;s the Sewer!&rsquo; cried another. &lsquo;Here&rsquo;s the New York Sewer! Here&rsquo;s some
      of the twelfth thousand of to-day&rsquo;s Sewer, with the best accounts of the
      markets, and all the shipping news, and four whole columns of country
      correspondence, and a full account of the Ball at Mrs White&rsquo;s last night,
      where all the beauty and fashion of New York was assembled; with the
      Sewer&rsquo;s own particulars of the private lives of all the ladies that was
      there! Here&rsquo;s the Sewer! Here&rsquo;s some of the twelfth thousand of the New
      York Sewer! Here&rsquo;s the Sewer&rsquo;s exposure of the Wall Street Gang, and the

      of a flagrant act of dishonesty committed by the Secretary of State when
      he was eight years old; now communicated, at a great expense, by his own
      nurse. Here&rsquo;s the Sewer! Here&rsquo;s the New York Sewer, in its twelfth
      thousand, with a whole column of New Yorkers to be shown up, and all their
      names printed! Here&rsquo;s the Sewer&rsquo;s article upon the Judge that tried him,
      day afore yesterday, for libel, and the Sewer&rsquo;s tribute to the independent
      Jury that didn&rsquo;t convict him, and the Sewer&rsquo;s account of what they might
      have expected if they had! Here&rsquo;s the Sewer, here&rsquo;s the Sewer! Here&rsquo;s the
      wide-awake Sewer; always on the lookout; the leading Journal of the United
      States, now in its twelfth thousand, and still a-printing off:&mdash;Here&rsquo;s
      the New York Sewer!&rsquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;It is in such enlightened means,&rsquo; said a voice almost in Martin&rsquo;s ear,
      &lsquo;that the bubbling passions of my country find a vent.&rsquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      Martin turned involuntarily, and saw, standing close at his side, a sallow
      gentleman, with sunken cheeks, black hair, small twinkling eyes, and a
      singular expression hovering about that region of his face, which was not
      a frown, nor a leer, and yet might have been mistaken at the first glance
      for either. Indeed it would have been difficult, on a much closer
      acquaintance, to describe it in any more satisfactory terms than as a
      mixed expression of vulgar cunning and conceit. This gentleman wore a
      rather broad-brimmed hat for the greater wisdom of his appearance; and had
      his arms folded for the greater impressiveness of his attitude. He was
      somewhat shabbily dressed in a blue surtout reaching nearly to his ankles,
      short loose trousers of the same colour, and a faded buff waistcoat,
      through which a discoloured shirt-frill struggled to force itself into
      notice, as asserting an equality of civil rights with the other portions
      of his dress, and maintaining a declaration of Independence on its own
      account. His feet, which were of unusually large proportions, were
      leisurely crossed before him as he half leaned against, half sat upon, the
      steamboat&rsquo;s bulwark; and his thick cane, shod with a mighty ferule at one
      end and armed with a great metal knob at the other, depended from a
      line-and-tassel on his wrist. Thus attired, and thus composed into an
      aspect of great profundity, the gentleman twitched up the right-hand
      corner of his mouth and his right eye simultaneously, and said, once more:
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;It is in such enlightened means that the bubbling passions of my country
      find a vent.&rsquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      As he looked at Martin, and nobody else was by, Martin inclined his head,
      and said:
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;You allude to&mdash;?&rsquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;To the Palladium of rational Liberty at home, sir, and the dread of
      Foreign oppression abroad,&rsquo; returned the gentleman, as he pointed with his
      cane to an uncommonly dirty newsboy with one eye. &lsquo;To the Envy of the
      world, sir, and the leaders of Human Civilization. Let me ask you sir,&rsquo; he
      added, bringing the ferule of his stick heavily upon the deck with the air
      of a man who must not be equivocated with, &lsquo;how do you like my Country?&rsquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;I am hardly prepared to answer that question yet,&rsquo; said Martin &lsquo;seeing
      that I have not been ashore.&rsquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Well, I should expect you were not prepared, sir,&rsquo; said the gentleman,
      &lsquo;to behold such signs of National Prosperity as those?&rsquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      He pointed to the vessels lying at the wharves; and then gave a vague
      flourish with his stick, as if he would include the air and water,
      generally, in this remark.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Really,&rsquo; said Martin, &lsquo;I don&rsquo;t know. Yes. I think I was.&rsquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      The gentleman glanced at him with a knowing look, and said he liked his
      policy. It was natural, he said, and it pleased him as a philosopher to
      observe the prejudices of human nature.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;You have brought, I see, sir,&rsquo; he said, turning round towards Martin, and
      resting his chin on the top of his stick, &lsquo;the usual amount of misery and
      poverty and ignorance and crime, to be located in the bosom of the great
      Republic. Well, sir! let &lsquo;em come on in shiploads from the old country.
      When vessels are about to founder, the rats are said to leave &lsquo;em. There
      is considerable of truth, I find, in that remark.&rsquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;The old ship will keep afloat a year or two longer yet, perhaps,&rsquo; said
      Martin with a smile, partly occasioned by what the gentleman said, and
      partly by his manner of saying it, which was odd enough for he emphasised
      all the small words and syllables in his discourse, and left the others to
      take care of themselves; as if he thought the larger parts of speech could
      be trusted alone, but the little ones required to be constantly looked
      after.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Hope is said by the poet, sir,&rsquo; observed the gentleman, &lsquo;to be the nurse
      of young Desire.&rsquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      Martin signified that he had heard of the cardinal virtue in question
      serving occasionally in that domestic capacity.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;She will not rear her infant in the present instance, sir, you&rsquo;ll find,&rsquo;
      observed the gentleman.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Time will show,&rsquo; said Martin.
    </p>
    <p>
      The gentleman nodded his head gravely; and said, &lsquo;What is your name, sir?&rsquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      Martin told him.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;How old are you, sir?&rsquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      Martin told him.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;What is your profession, sir?&rsquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      Martin told him that also.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;What is your destination, sir?&rsquo; inquired the gentleman.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Really,&rsquo; said Martin laughing, &lsquo;I can&rsquo;t satisfy you in that particular,
      for I don&rsquo;t know it myself.&rsquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Yes?&rsquo; said the gentleman.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;No,&rsquo; said Martin.
    </p>
    <p>
      The gentleman adjusted his cane under his left arm, and took a more
      deliberate and complete survey of Martin than he had yet had leisure to
      make. When he had completed his inspection, he put out his right hand,
      shook Martin&rsquo;s hand, and said:
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;My name is Colonel Diver, sir. I am the Editor of the New York Rowdy
      Journal.&rsquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      Martin received the communication with that degree of respect which an
      announcement so distinguished appeared to demand.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;The New York Rowdy Journal, sir,&rsquo; resumed the colonel, &lsquo;is, as I expect
      you know, the organ of our aristocracy in this city.&rsquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Oh! there <i>is</i> an aristocracy here, then?&rsquo; said Martin. &lsquo;Of what is it
      composed?&rsquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Of intelligence, sir,&rsquo; replied the colonel; &lsquo;of intelligence and virtue.
      And of their necessary consequence in this republic&mdash;dollars, sir.&rsquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      Martin was very glad to hear this, feeling well assured that if
      intelligence and virtue led, as a matter of course, to the acquisition of
      dollars, he would speedily become a great capitalist. He was about to
      express the gratification such news afforded him, when he was interrupted
      by the captain of the ship, who came up at the moment to shake hands with
      the colonel; and who, seeing a well-dressed stranger on the deck (for
      Martin had thrown aside his cloak), shook hands with him also. This was an
      unspeakable relief to Martin, who, in spite of the acknowledged supremacy
      of Intelligence and virtue in that happy country, would have been deeply
      mortified to appear before Colonel Diver in the poor character of a
      steerage passenger.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Well cap&rsquo;en!&rsquo; said the colonel.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Well colonel,&rsquo; cried the captain. &lsquo;You&rsquo;re looking most uncommon bright,
      sir. I can hardly realise its being you, and that&rsquo;s a fact.&rsquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;A good passage, cap&rsquo;en?&rsquo; inquired the colonel, taking him aside,
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Well now! It was a pretty spanking run, sir,&rsquo; said, or rather sung, the
      captain, who was a genuine New Englander; &lsquo;considerin&rsquo; the weather.&rsquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Yes?&rsquo; said the colonel.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Well! It was, sir,&rsquo; said the captain. &lsquo;I&rsquo;ve just now sent a boy up to
      your office with the passenger-list, colonel.&rsquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;You haven&rsquo;t got another boy to spare, p&rsquo;raps, cap&rsquo;en?&rsquo; said the colonel,
      in a tone almost amounting to severity.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;I guess there air a dozen if you want &lsquo;em, colonel,&rsquo; said the captain.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;One moderate big &lsquo;un could convey a dozen champagne, perhaps,&rsquo; observed
      the colonel, musing, &lsquo;to my office. You said a spanking run, I think?&rsquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Well, so I did,&rsquo; was the reply.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;It&rsquo;s very nigh, you know,&rsquo; observed the colonel. &lsquo;I&rsquo;m glad it was a
      spanking run, cap&rsquo;en. Don&rsquo;t mind about quarts if you&rsquo;re short of &lsquo;em. The
      boy can as well bring four-and-twenty pints, and travel twice as once.&mdash;A
      first-rate spanker, cap&rsquo;en, was it? Yes?&rsquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;A most e&mdash;tarnal spanker,&rsquo; said the skipper.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;I admire at your good fortun, cap&rsquo;en. You might loan me a corkscrew at
      the same time, and half-a-dozen glasses if you liked. However bad the
      elements combine against my country&rsquo;s noble packet-ship, the Screw, sir,&rsquo;
      said the colonel, turning to Martin, and drawing a flourish on the surface
      of the deck with his cane, &lsquo;her passage either way is almost certain to
      eventuate a spanker!&rsquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      The captain, who had the Sewer below at that moment, lunching expensively
      in one cabin, while the amiable Stabber was drinking himself into a state
      of blind madness in another, took a cordial leave of his friend the
      colonel, and hurried away to dispatch the champagne; well knowing (as it
      afterwards appeared) that if he failed to conciliate the editor of the
      Rowdy Journal, that potentate would denounce him and his ship in large
      capitals before he was a day older; and would probably assault the memory
      of his mother also, who had not been dead more than twenty years. The
      colonel being again left alone with Martin, checked him as he was moving
      away, and offered in consideration of his being an Englishman, to show him
      the town and to introduce him, if such were his desire, to a genteel
      boarding-house. But before they entered on these proceedings (he said), he
      would beseech the honour of his company at the office of the Rowdy
      Journal, to partake of a bottle of champagne of his own importation.
    </p>
    <p>
      All this was so extremely kind and hospitable, that Martin, though it was
      quite early in the morning, readily acquiesced. So, instructing Mark, who
      was deeply engaged with his friend and her three children, that when he
      had done assisting them, and had cleared the baggage, he was to wait for
      further orders at the Rowdy Journal Office, Martin accompanied his new
      friend on shore.
    </p>
    <p>
      They made their way as they best could through the melancholy crowd of
      emigrants upon the wharf, who, grouped about their beds and boxes, with
      the bare ground below them and the bare sky above, might have fallen from
      another planet, for anything they knew of the country; and walked for some
      short distance along a busy street, bounded on one side by the quays and
      shipping; and on the other by a long row of staring red-brick storehouses
      and offices, ornamented with more black boards and white letters, and more
      white boards and black letters, than Martin had ever seen before, in fifty
      times the space. Presently they turned up a narrow street, and presently
      into other narrow streets, until at last they stopped before a house
      whereon was painted in great characters, &lsquo;<i>Rowdy Journal</i>.&rsquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      The colonel, who had walked the whole way with one hand in his breast, his
      head occasionally wagging from side to side, and his hat thrown back upon
      his ears, like a man who was oppressed to inconvenience by a sense of his
      own greatness, led the way up a dark and dirty flight of stairs into a
      room of similar character, all littered and bestrewn with odds and ends of
      newspapers and other crumpled fragments, both in proof and manuscript.
      Behind a mangy old writing-table in this apartment sat a figure with a
      stump of a pen in its mouth and a great pair of scissors in its right
      hand, clipping and slicing at a file of Rowdy Journals; and it was such a
      laughable figure that Martin had some difficulty in preserving his
      gravity, though conscious of the close observation of Colonel Diver.
    </p>
    <p>
      The individual who sat clipping and slicing as aforesaid at the Rowdy
      Journals, was a small young gentleman of very juvenile appearance, and
      unwholesomely pale in the face; partly, perhaps, from intense thought, but
      partly, there is no doubt, from the excessive use of tobacco, which he was
      at that moment chewing vigorously. He wore his shirt-collar turned down
      over a black ribbon; and his lank hair, a fragile crop, was not only
      smoothed and parted back from his brow, that none of the Poetry of his
      aspect might be lost, but had, here and there, been grubbed up by the
      roots; which accounted for his loftiest developments being somewhat
      pimply. He had that order of nose on which the envy of mankind has
      bestowed the appellation &lsquo;snub,&rsquo; and it was very much turned up at the
      end, as with a lofty scorn. Upon the upper lip of this young gentleman
      were tokens of a sandy down; so very, very smooth and scant, that, though
      encouraged to the utmost, it looked more like a recent trace of
      gingerbread than the fair promise of a moustache; and this conjecture, his
      apparently tender age went far to strengthen. He was intent upon his work.
      Every time he snapped the great pair of scissors, he made a corresponding
      motion with his jaws, which gave him a very terrible appearance.
    </p>
    <p>
      Martin was not long in determining within himself that this must be
      Colonel Diver&rsquo;s son; the hope of the family, and future mainspring of the
      Rowdy Journal. Indeed he had begun to say that he presumed this was the
      colonel&rsquo;s little boy, and that it was very pleasant to see him playing at
      Editor in all the guilelessness of childhood, when the colonel proudly
      interposed and said:
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;My War Correspondent, sir&mdash;Mr Jefferson Brick!&rsquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      Martin could not help starting at this unexpected announcement, and the
      consciousness of the irretrievable mistake he had nearly made.
    </p>
    <p>
      Mr Brick seemed pleased with the sensation he produced upon the stranger,
      and shook hands with him, with an air of patronage designed to reassure
      him, and to let him blow that there was no occasion to be frightened, for
      he (Brick) wouldn&rsquo;t hurt him.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;You have heard of Jefferson Brick, I see, sir,&rsquo; quoth the colonel, with a
      smile. &lsquo;England has heard of Jefferson Brick. Europe has heard of
      Jefferson Brick. Let me see. When did you leave England, sir?&rsquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Five weeks ago,&rsquo; said Martin.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Five weeks ago,&rsquo; repeated the colonel, thoughtfully; as he took his seat
      upon the table, and swung his legs. &lsquo;Now let me ask you, sir which of Mr
      Brick&rsquo;s articles had become at that time the most obnoxious to the British
      Parliament and the Court of Saint James&rsquo;s?&rsquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Upon my word,&rsquo; said Martin, &lsquo;I&mdash;&rsquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;I have reason to know, sir,&rsquo; interrupted the colonel, &lsquo;that the
      aristocratic circles of your country quail before the name of Jefferson
      Brick. I should like to be informed, sir, from your lips, which of his
      sentiments has struck the deadliest blow&mdash;&rsquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;At the hundred heads of the Hydra of Corruption now grovelling in the
      dust beneath the lance of Reason, and spouting up to the universal arch
      above us, its sanguinary gore,&rsquo; said Mr Brick, putting on a little blue
      cloth cap with a glazed front, and quoting his last article.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;The libation of freedom, Brick&rsquo;&mdash;hinted the colonel.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;&mdash;Must sometimes be quaffed in blood, colonel,&rsquo; cried Brick. And
      when he said &lsquo;blood,&rsquo; he gave the great pair of scissors a sharp snap, as
      if <i>they </i>said blood too, and were quite of his opinion.

    <p>
      This done, they both looked at Martin, pausing for a reply.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Upon my life,&rsquo; said Martin, who had by this time quite recovered his
      usual coolness, &lsquo;I can&rsquo;t give you any satisfactory information about it;
      for the truth is that I&mdash;&rsquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Stop!&rsquo; cried the colonel, glancing sternly at his war correspondent and
      giving his head one shake after every sentence. &lsquo;That you never heard of
      Jefferson Brick, sir. That you never read Jefferson Brick, sir. That you
      never saw the Rowdy Journal, sir. That you never knew, sir, of its mighty
      influence upon the cabinets of Europe. Yes?&rsquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;That&rsquo;s what I was about to observe, certainly,&rsquo; said Martin.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Keep cool, Jefferson,&rsquo; said the colonel gravely. &lsquo;Don&rsquo;t bust! oh you
      Europeans! After that, let&rsquo;s have a glass of wine!&rsquo; So saying, he got down
      from the table, and produced, from a basket outside the door, a bottle of
      champagne, and three glasses.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Mr Jefferson Brick, sir,&rsquo; said the colonel, filling Martin&rsquo;s glass and
      his own, and pushing the bottle to that gentleman, &lsquo;will give us a
      sentiment.&rsquo;

      &lsquo;Well, sir!&rsquo; cried the war correspondent, &lsquo;Since you have concluded to
      call upon me, I will respond. I will give you, sir, The Rowdy Journal and
      its brethren; the well of Truth, whose waters are black from being
      composed of printers&rsquo; ink, but are quite clear enough for my country to
      behold the shadow of her Destiny reflected in.&rsquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Hear, hear!&rsquo; cried the colonel, with great complacency. &lsquo;There are
      flowery components, sir, in the language of my friend?&rsquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Very much so, indeed,&rsquo; said Martin.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;There is to-day&rsquo;s Rowdy, sir,&rsquo; observed the colonel, handing him a paper.
      &lsquo;You&rsquo;ll find Jefferson Brick at his usual post in the van of human
      civilization and moral purity.&rsquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      The colonel was by this time seated on the table again. Mr Brick also took
      up a position on that same piece of furniture; and they fell to drinking
      pretty hard. They often looked at Martin as he read the paper, and then at
      each other. When he laid it down, which was not until they had finished a
      second bottle, the colonel asked him what he thought of it.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Why, it&rsquo;s horribly personal,&rsquo; said Martin.
    </p>
    <p>
      The colonel seemed much flattered by this remark; and said he hoped it
      was.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;We are independent here, sir,&rsquo; said Mr Jefferson Brick. &lsquo;We do as we
      like.&rsquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;If I may judge from this specimen,&rsquo; returned Martin, &lsquo;there must be a few
      thousands here, rather the reverse of independent, who do as they don&rsquo;t
      like.&rsquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Well! They yield to the popular mind of the Popular Instructor, sir,&rsquo;
      said the colonel. &lsquo;They rile up, sometimes; but in general we have a hold
      upon our citizens, both in public and in private life, which is as much
      one of the ennobling institutions of our happy country as&mdash;&rsquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;As nigger slavery itself,&rsquo; suggested Mr Brick.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;En&mdash;tirely so,&rsquo; remarked the colonel.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Pray,&rsquo; said Martin, after some hesitation, &lsquo;may I venture to ask, with
      reference to a case I observe in this paper of yours, whether the Popular
      Instructor often deals in&mdash;I am at a loss to express it without
      giving you offence&mdash;in forgery? In forged letters, for instance,&rsquo; he
      pursued, for the colonel was perfectly calm and quite at his ease,
      &lsquo;solemnly purporting to have been written at recent periods by living
      men?&rsquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Well, sir!&rsquo; replied the colonel. &lsquo;It does, now and then.&rsquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;And the popular instructed&mdash;what do they do?&rsquo; asked Martin.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Buy &lsquo;em:&rsquo; said the colonel.
    </p>
    <p>
      Mr Jefferson Brick expectorated and laughed; the former copiously, the
      latter approvingly.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Buy &lsquo;em by hundreds of thousands,&rsquo; resumed the colonel. &lsquo;We are a smart
      people here, and can appreciate smartness.&rsquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Is smartness American for forgery?&rsquo; asked Martin.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Well!&rsquo; said the colonel, &lsquo;I expect it&rsquo;s American for a good many things
      that you call by other names. But you can&rsquo;t help yourself in Europe. We
      can.&rsquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;And do, sometimes,&rsquo; thought Martin. &lsquo;You help yourselves with very little
      ceremony, too!&rsquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;At all events, whatever name we choose to employ,&rsquo; said the colonel,
      stooping down to roll the third empty bottle into a corner after the other
      two, &lsquo;I suppose the art of forgery was not invented here sir?&rsquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;I suppose not,&rsquo; replied Martin.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Nor any other kind of smartness I reckon?&rsquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Invented! No, I presume not.&rsquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Well!&rsquo; said the colonel; &lsquo;then we got it all from the old country, and
      the old country&rsquo;s to blame for it, and not the new &lsquo;un. There&rsquo;s an end of
      <i>that</i>. Now, if Mr Jefferson Brick and you will be so good as to clear, I&rsquo;ll
      come out last, and lock the door.&rsquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      Rightly interpreting this as the signal for their departure, Martin walked
      downstairs after the war correspondent, who preceded him with great
      majesty. The colonel following, they left the Rowdy Journal Office and
      walked forth into the streets; Martin feeling doubtful whether he ought to
      kick the colonel for having presumed to speak to him, or whether it came
      within the bounds of possibility that he and his establishment could be
      among the boasted usages of that regenerated land.
    </p>
    <p>
      It was clear that Colonel Diver, in the security of his strong position,
      and in his perfect understanding of the public sentiment, cared very
      little what Martin or anybody else thought about him. His high-spiced
      wares were made to sell, and they sold; and his thousands of readers could
      as rationally charge their delight in filth upon him, as a glutton can
      shift upon his cook the responsibility of his beastly excess. Nothing
      would have delighted the colonel more than to be told that no such man as
      he could walk in high success the streets of any other country in the
      world; for that would only have been a logical assurance to him of the
      correct adaptation of his labours to the prevailing taste, and of his
      being strictly and peculiarly a national feature of America.
    </p>
    <p>
      They walked a mile or more along a handsome street which the colonel said
      was called Broadway, and which Mr Jefferson Brick said &lsquo;whipped the
      universe.&rsquo; Turning, at length, into one of the numerous streets which
      branched from this main thoroughfare, they stopped before a rather
      mean-looking house with jalousie blinds to every window; a flight of steps
      before the green street-door; a shining white ornament on the rails on
      either side like a petrified pineapple, polished; a little oblong plate of
      the same material over the knocker whereon the name of &lsquo;Pawkins&rsquo; was
      engraved; and four accidental pigs looking down the area.
    </p>
    <p>
      The colonel knocked at this house with the air of a man who lived there;
      and an Irish girl popped her head out of one of the top windows to see who
      it was. Pending her journey downstairs, the pigs were joined by two or
      three friends from the next street, in company with whom they lay down
      sociably in the gutter.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Is the major indoors?&rsquo; inquired the colonel, as he entered.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Is it the master, sir?&rsquo; returned the girl, with a hesitation which seemed
      to imply that they were rather flush of majors in that establishment.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;The master!&rsquo; said Colonel Diver, stopping short and looking round at his
      war correspondent.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Oh! The depressing institutions of that British empire, colonel!&rsquo; said
      Jefferson Brick. &lsquo;Master!&rsquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;What&rsquo;s the matter with the word?&rsquo; asked Martin.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;I should hope it was never heard in our country, sir; that&rsquo;s all,&rsquo; said
      Jefferson Brick; &lsquo;except when it is used by some degraded Help, as new to
      the blessings of our form of government, as this Help is. There are no
      masters here.&rsquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;All &ldquo;owners,&rdquo; are they?&rsquo; said Martin.
    </p>
    <p>
      Mr Jefferson Brick followed in the Rowdy Journal&rsquo;s footsteps without
      returning any answer. Martin took the same course, thinking as he went,
      that perhaps the free and independent citizens, who in their moral
      elevation, owned the colonel for their master, might render better homage
      to the goddess, Liberty, in nightly dreams upon the oven of a Russian
      Serf.
    </p>
    <p>
      The colonel led the way into a room at the back of the house upon the
      ground-floor, light, and of fair dimensions, but exquisitely
      uncomfortable; having nothing in it but the four cold white walls and
      ceiling, a mean carpet, a dreary waste of dining-table reaching from end
      to end, and a bewildering collection of cane-bottomed chairs. In the
      further region of this banqueting-hall was a stove, garnished on either
      side with a great brass spittoon, and shaped in itself like three little
      iron barrels set up on end in a fender, and joined together on the
      principle of the Siamese Twins. Before it, swinging himself in a
      rocking-chair, lounged a large gentleman with his hat on, who amused
      himself by spitting alternately into the spittoon on the right hand of the
      stove, and the spittoon on the left, and then working his way back again
      in the same order. A negro lad in a soiled white jacket was busily engaged
      in placing on the table two long rows of knives and forks, relieved at
      intervals by jugs of water; and as he travelled down one side of this
      festive board, he straightened with his dirty hands the dirtier cloth,
      which was all askew, and had not been removed since breakfast. The
      atmosphere of this room was rendered intensely hot and stifling by the
      stove; but being further flavoured by a sickly gush of soup from the
      kitchen, and by such remote suggestions of tobacco as lingered within the
      brazen receptacles already mentioned, it became, to a stranger&rsquo;s senses,
      almost insupportable.
    </p>
    <p>
      The gentleman in the rocking-chair having his back towards them, and being
      much engaged in his intellectual pastime, was not aware of their approach
      until the colonel, walking up to the stove, contributed his mite towards
      the support of the left-hand spittoon, just as the major&mdash;for it was
      the major&mdash;bore down upon it. Major Pawkins then reserved his fire,
      and looking upward, said, with a peculiar air of quiet weariness, like a
      man who had been up all night&mdash;an air which Martin had already
      observed both in the colonel and Mr Jefferson Brick&mdash;
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Well, colonel!&rsquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Here is a gentleman from England, major,&rsquo; the colonel replied, &lsquo;who has
      concluded to locate himself here if the amount of compensation suits him.&rsquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;I am glad to see you, sir,&rsquo; observed the major, shaking hands with
      Martin, and not moving a muscle of his face. &lsquo;You are pretty bright, I
      hope?&rsquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Never better,&rsquo; said Martin.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;You are never likely to be,&rsquo; returned the major. &lsquo;You will see the sun
      shine <i>here</i>.&rsquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;I think I remember to have seen it shine at home sometimes,&rsquo; said Martin,
      smiling.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;I think not,&rsquo; replied the major. He said so with a stoical indifference
      certainly, but still in a tone of firmness which admitted of no further
      dispute on that point. When he had thus settled the question, he put his
      hat a little on one side for the greater convenience of scratching his
      head, and saluted Mr Jefferson Brick with a lazy nod.
    </p>
    <p>
      Major Pawkins (a gentleman of Pennsylvanian origin) was distinguished by a
      very large skull, and a great mass of yellow forehead; in deference to
      which commodities it was currently held in bar-rooms and other such places
      of resort that the major was a man of huge sagacity. He was further to be
      known by a heavy eye and a dull slow manner; and for being a man of that
      kind who&mdash;mentally speaking&mdash;requires a deal of room to turn
      himself in. But, in trading on his stock of wisdom, he invariably
      proceeded on the principle of putting all the goods he had (and more) into
      his window; and that went a great way with his constituency of admirers.
      It went a great way, perhaps, with Mr Jefferson Brick, who took occasion
      to whisper in Martin&rsquo;s ear:
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;One of the most remarkable men in our country, sir!&rsquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      It must not be supposed, however, that the perpetual exhibition in the
      market-place of all his stock-in-trade for sale or hire, was the major&rsquo;s
      sole claim to a very large share of sympathy and support. He was a great
      politician; and the one article of his creed, in reference to all public
      obligations involving the good faith and integrity of his country, was,
      &lsquo;run a moist pen slick through everything, and start fresh.&rsquo; This made him
      a patriot. In commercial affairs he was a bold speculator. In plainer
      words he had a most distinguished genius for swindling, and could start a
      bank, or negotiate a loan, or form a land-jobbing company (entailing ruin,
      pestilence, and death, on hundreds of families), with any gifted creature
      in the Union. This made him an admirable man of business. He could hang
      about a bar-room, discussing the affairs of the nation, for twelve hours
      together; and in that time could hold forth with more intolerable dulness,
      chew more tobacco, smoke more tobacco, drink more rum-toddy, mint-julep,
      gin-sling, and cocktail, than any private gentleman of his acquaintance.
      This made him an orator and a man of the people. In a word, the major was
      a rising character, and a popular character, and was in a fair way to be
      sent by the popular party to the State House of New York, if not in the
      end to Washington itself. But as a man&rsquo;s private prosperity does not
      always keep pace with his patriotic devotion to public affairs; and as
      fraudulent transactions have their downs as well as ups, the major was
      occasionally under a cloud. Hence, just now Mrs Pawkins kept a
      boarding-house, and Major Pawkins rather &lsquo;loafed&rsquo; his time away than
      otherwise.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;You have come to visit our country, sir, at a season of great commercial
      depression,&rsquo; said the major.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;At an alarming crisis,&rsquo; said the colonel.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;At a period of unprecedented stagnation,&rsquo; said Mr Jefferson Brick.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;I am sorry to hear that,&rsquo; returned Martin. &lsquo;It&rsquo;s not likely to last, I
      hope?&rsquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      Martin knew nothing about America, or he would have known perfectly well
      that if its individual citizens, to a man, are to be believed, it always
      <i>is</i> depressed, and always <i>is</i> stagnated, and always <i>is</i> at an alarming
      crisis, and never was otherwise; though as a body they are ready to make
      oath upon the Evangelists at any hour of the day or night, that it is the
      most thriving and prosperous of all countries on the habitable globe.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;It&rsquo;s not likely to last, I hope?&rsquo; said Martin.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Well!&rsquo; returned the major, &lsquo;I expect we shall get along somehow, and come
      right in the end.&rsquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;We are an elastic country,&rsquo; said the Rowdy Journal.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;We are a young lion,&rsquo; said Mr Jefferson Brick.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;We have revivifying and vigorous principles within ourselves,&rsquo; observed
      the major. &lsquo;Shall we drink a bitter afore dinner, colonel?&rsquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      The colonel assenting to this proposal with great alacrity, Major Pawkins
      proposed an adjournment to a neighbouring bar-room, which, as he observed,
      was &lsquo;only in the next block.&rsquo; He then referred Martin to Mrs Pawkins for
      all particulars connected with the rate of board and lodging, and informed
      him that he would have the pleasure of seeing that lady at dinner, which
      would soon be ready, as the dinner hour was two o&rsquo;clock, and it only
      wanted a quarter now. This reminded him that if the bitter were to be
      taken at all, there was no time to lose; so he walked off without more
      ado, and left them to follow if they thought proper.
    </p>
    <p>
      When the major rose from his rocking-chair before the stove, and so
      disturbed the hot air and balmy whiff of soup which fanned their brows,
      the odour of stale tobacco became so decidedly prevalent as to leave no
      doubt of its proceeding mainly from that gentleman&rsquo;s attire. Indeed, as
      Martin walked behind him to the bar-room, he could not help thinking that
      the great square major, in his listlessness and langour, looked very much
      like a stale weed himself; such as might be hoed out of the public garden,
      with great advantage to the decent growth of that preserve, and tossed on
      some congenial dunghill.
    </p>
    <p>
      They encountered more weeds in the bar-room, some of whom (being thirsty
      souls as well as dirty) were pretty stale in one sense, and pretty fresh
      in another. Among them was a gentleman who, as Martin gathered from the
      conversation that took place over the bitter, started that afternoon for
      the Far West on a six months&rsquo; business tour, and who, as his outfit and
      equipment for this journey, had just such another shiny hat and just such
      another little pale valise as had composed the luggage of the gentleman
      who came from England in the Screw.
    </p>
    <p>
      They were walking back very leisurely; Martin arm-in-arm with Mr Jefferson
      Brick, and the major and the colonel side-by-side before them; when, as
      they came within a house or two of the major&rsquo;s residence, they heard a
      bell ringing violently. The instant this sound struck upon their ears, the
      colonel and the major darted off, dashed up the steps and in at the
      street-door (which stood ajar) like lunatics; while Mr Jefferson Brick,
      detaching his arm from Martin&rsquo;s, made a precipitate dive in the same
      direction, and vanished also.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Good Heaven!&rsquo; thought Martin. &lsquo;The premises are on fire! It was an alarm
      bell!&rsquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      But there was no smoke to be seen, nor any flame, nor was there any smell
      of fire. As Martin faltered on the pavement, three more gentlemen, with
      horror and agitation depicted in their faces, came plunging wildly round
      the street corner; jostled each other on the steps; struggled for an
      instant; and rushed into the house, a confused heap of arms and legs.
      Unable to bear it any longer, Martin followed. Even in his rapid progress
      he was run down, thrust aside, and passed, by two more gentlemen, stark
      mad, as it appeared, with fierce excitement.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Where is it?&rsquo; cried Martin, breathlessly, to a negro whom he encountered
      in the passage.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;In a eatin room, sa. Kernell, sa, him kep a seat &lsquo;side himself, sa.&rsquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;A seat!&rsquo; cried Martin.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;For a dinnar, sa.&rsquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      Martin started at him for a moment, and burst into a hearty laugh; to
      which the negro, out of his natural good humour and desire to please, so
      heartily responded, that his teeth shone like a gleam of light. &lsquo;You&rsquo;re
      the pleasantest fellow I have seen yet,&rsquo; said Martin clapping him on the
      back, &lsquo;and give me a better appetite than bitters.&rsquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      With this sentiment he walked into the dining-room and slipped into a
      chair next the colonel, which that gentleman (by this time nearly through
      his dinner) had turned down in reserve for him, with its back against the
      table.
    </p>
    <p>
      It was a numerous company&mdash;eighteen or twenty perhaps. Of these some
      five or six were ladies, who sat wedged together in a little phalanx by
      themselves. All the knives and forks were working away at a rate that was
      quite alarming; very few words were spoken; and everybody seemed to eat
      his utmost in self-defence, as if a famine were expected to set in before
      breakfast time to-morrow morning, and it had become high time to assert
      the first law of nature. The poultry, which may perhaps be considered to
      have formed the staple of the entertainment&mdash;for there was a turkey
      at the top, a pair of ducks at the bottom, and two fowls in the middle&mdash;disappeared
      as rapidly as if every bird had had the use of its wings, and had flown in
      desperation down a human throat. The oysters, stewed and pickled, leaped
      from their capacious reservoirs, and slid by scores into the mouths of the
      assembly. The sharpest pickles vanished, whole cucumbers at once, like
      sugar-plums, and no man winked his eye. Great heaps of indigestible matter
      melted away as ice before the sun. It was a solemn and an awful thing to
      see. Dyspeptic individuals bolted their food in wedges; feeding, not
      themselves, but broods of nightmares, who were continually standing at
      livery within them. Spare men, with lank and rigid cheeks, came out
      unsatisfied from the destruction of heavy dishes, and glared with watchful
      eyes upon the pastry. What Mrs Pawkins felt each day at dinner-time is
      hidden from all human knowledge. But she had one comfort. It was very soon
      over.
    </p>
    <p>
      When the colonel had finished his dinner, which event took place while
      Martin, who had sent his plate for some turkey, was waiting to begin, he
      asked him what he thought of the boarders, who were from all parts of the
      Union, and whether he would like to know any particulars concerning them.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Pray,&rsquo; said Martin, &lsquo;who is that sickly little girl opposite, with the
      tight round eyes? I don&rsquo;t see anybody here, who looks like her mother, or
      who seems to have charge of her.&rsquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Do you mean the matron in blue, sir?&rsquo; asked the colonel, with emphasis.
      &lsquo;That is Mrs Jefferson Brick, sir.&rsquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;No, no,&rsquo; said Martin, &lsquo;I mean the little girl, like a doll; directly
      opposite.&rsquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Well, sir!&rsquo; cried the colonel. &lsquo;<i>that </i>is Mrs Jefferson Brick.&rsquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      Martin glanced at the colonel&rsquo;s face, but he was quite serious.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Bless my soul! I suppose there will be a young Brick then, one of these
      days?&rsquo; said Martin.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;There are two young Bricks already, sir,&rsquo; returned the colonel.
    </p>
    <p>
      The matron looked so uncommonly like a child herself, that Martin could
      not help saying as much. &lsquo;Yes, sir,&rsquo; returned the colonel, &lsquo;but some
      institutions develop human natur; others re&mdash;tard it.&rsquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Jefferson Brick,&rsquo; he observed after a short silence, in commendation of
      his correspondent, &lsquo;is one of the most remarkable men in our country,
      sir!&rsquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      This had passed almost in a whisper, for the distinguished gentleman
      alluded to sat on Martin&rsquo;s other hand.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Pray, Mr Brick,&rsquo; said Martin, turning to him, and asking a question more
      for conversation&rsquo;s sake than from any feeling of interest in its subject,
      &lsquo;who is that;&rsquo; he was going to say &lsquo;young&rsquo; but thought it prudent to
      eschew the word&mdash;&lsquo;that very short gentleman yonder, with the red
      nose?&rsquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;That is Pro&mdash;fessor Mullit, sir,&rsquo; replied Jefferson.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;May I ask what he is professor of?&rsquo; asked Martin.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Of education, sir,&rsquo; said Jefferson Brick.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;A sort of schoolmaster, possibly?&rsquo; Martin ventured to observe.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;He is a man of fine moral elements, sir, and not commonly endowed,&rsquo; said
      the war correspondent. &lsquo;He felt it necessary, at the last election for
      President, to repudiate and denounce his father, who voted on the wrong
      interest. He has since written some powerful pamphlets, under the
      signature of &ldquo;Suturb,&rdquo; or Brutus reversed. He is one of the most
      remarkable men in our country, sir.&rsquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;There seem to be plenty of &lsquo;em,&rsquo; thought Martin, &lsquo;at any rate.&rsquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      Pursuing his inquiries Martin found that there were no fewer than four
      majors present, two colonels, one general, and a captain, so that he could
      not help thinking how strongly officered the American militia must be; and
      wondering very much whether the officers commanded each other; or if they
      did not, where on earth the privates came from. There seemed to be no man
      there without a title; for those who had not attained to military honours
      were either doctors, professors, or reverends. Three very hard and
      disagreeable gentlemen were on missions from neighbouring States; one on
      monetary affairs, one on political, one on sectarian. Among the ladies,
      there were Mrs Pawkins, who was very straight, bony, and silent; and a
      wiry-faced old damsel, who held strong sentiments touching the rights of
      women, and had diffused the same in lectures; but the rest were strangely
      devoid of individual traits of character, insomuch that any one of them
      might have changed minds with the other, and nobody would have found it
      out. These, by the way, were the only members of the party who did not
      appear to be among the most remarkable people in the country.
    </p>
    <p>
      Several of the gentlemen got up, one by one, and walked off as they
      swallowed their last morsel; pausing generally by the stove for a minute
      or so to refresh themselves at the brass spittoons. A few sedentary
      characters, however, remained at table full a quarter of an hour, and did
      not rise until the ladies rose, when all stood up.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Where are they going?&rsquo; asked Martin, in the ear of Mr Jefferson Brick.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;To their bedrooms, sir.&rsquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Is there no dessert, or other interval of conversation?&rsquo; asked Martin,
      who was disposed to enjoy himself after his long voyage.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;We are a busy people here, sir, and have no time for that,&rsquo; was the
      reply.
    </p>
    <p>
      So the ladies passed out in single file; Mr Jefferson Brick and such other
      married gentlemen as were left, acknowledging the departure of their other
      halves by a nod; and there was an end of <i>them</i>. Martin thought this an
      uncomfortable custom, but he kept his opinion to himself for the present,
      being anxious to hear, and inform himself by, the conversation of the busy
      gentlemen, who now lounged about the stove as if a great weight had been
      taken off their minds by the withdrawal of the other sex; and who made a
      plentiful use of the spittoons and their toothpicks.
    </p>
    <p>
      It was rather barren of interest, to say the truth; and the greater part
      of it may be summed up in one word. Dollars. All their cares, hopes, joys,
      affections, virtues, and associations, seemed to be melted down into
      dollars. Whatever the chance contributions that fell into the slow
      cauldron of their talk, they made the gruel thick and slab with dollars.
      Men were weighed by their dollars, measures gauged by their dollars; life
      was auctioneered, appraised, put up, and knocked down for its dollars. The
      next respectable thing to dollars was any venture having their attainment
      for its end. The more of that worthless ballast, honour and fair-dealing,
      which any man cast overboard from the ship of his Good Name and Good
      Intent, the more ample stowage-room he had for dollars. Make commerce one
      huge lie and mighty theft. Deface the banner of the nation for an idle
      rag; pollute it star by star; and cut out stripe by stripe as from the arm
      of a degraded soldier. Do anything for dollars! What is a flag to <i>them</i>!
    </p>
    <p>
      One who rides at all hazards of limb and life in the chase of a fox, will
      prefer to ride recklessly at most times. So it was with these gentlemen.
      He was the greatest patriot, in their eyes, who brawled the loudest, and
      who cared the least for decency. He was their champion who, in the brutal
      fury of his own pursuit, could cast no stigma upon them for the hot
      knavery of theirs. Thus, Martin learned in the five minutes&rsquo; straggling
      talk about the stove, that to carry pistols into legislative assemblies,
      and swords in sticks, and other such peaceful toys; to seize opponents by
      the throat, as dogs or rats might do; to bluster, bully, and overbear by
      personal assailment; were glowing deeds. Not thrusts and stabs at Freedom,
      striking far deeper into her House of Life than any sultan&rsquo;s scimitar
      could reach; but rare incense on her altars, having a grateful scent in
      patriotic nostrils, and curling upward to the seventh heaven of Fame.
    </p>
    <p>
      Once or twice, when there was a pause, Martin asked such questions as
      naturally occurred to him, being a stranger, about the national poets, the
      theatre, literature, and the arts. But the information which these
      gentlemen were in a condition to give him on such topics, did not extend
      beyond the effusions of such master-spirits of the time as Colonel Diver,
      Mr Jefferson Brick, and others; renowned, as it appeared, for excellence
      in the achievement of a peculiar style of broadside essay called &lsquo;a
      screamer.&rsquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;We are a busy people, sir,&rsquo; said one of the captains, who was from the
      West, &lsquo;and have no time for reading mere notions. We don&rsquo;t mind &lsquo;em if
      they come to us in newspapers along with almighty strong stuff of another
      sort, but darn your books.&rsquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      Here the general, who appeared to grow quite faint at the bare thought of
      reading anything which was neither mercantile nor political, and was not
      in a newspaper, inquired &lsquo;if any gentleman would drink some?&rsquo; Most of the
      company, considering this a very choice and seasonable idea, lounged out,
      one by one, to the bar-room in the next block. Thence they probably went
      to their stores and counting-houses; thence to the bar-room again, to talk
      once more of dollars, and enlarge their minds with the perusal and
      discussion of screamers; and thence each man to snore in the bosom of his
      own family.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Which would seem,&rsquo; said Martin, pursuing the current of his own thoughts,
      &lsquo;to be the principal recreation they enjoy in common.&rsquo; With that, he fell
      a-musing again on dollars, demagogues, and bar-rooms; debating within
      himself whether busy people of this class were really as busy as they
      claimed to be, or only had an inaptitude for social and domestic pleasure.
    </p>
    <p>
      It was a difficult question to solve; and the mere fact of its being
      strongly presented to his mind by all that he had seen and heard, was not
      encouraging. He sat down at the deserted board, and becoming more and more
      despondent, as he thought of all the uncertainties and difficulties of his
      precarious situation, sighed heavily.
    </p>
    <p>
      Now, there had been at the dinner-table a middle-aged man with a dark eye
      and a sunburnt face, who had attracted Martin&rsquo;s attention by having
      something very engaging and honest in the expression of his features; but
      of whom he could learn nothing from either of his neighbours, who seemed
      to consider him quite beneath their notice. He had taken no part in the
      conversation round the stove, nor had he gone forth with the rest; and
      now, when he heard Martin sigh for the third or fourth time, he interposed
      with some casual remark, as if he desired, without obtruding himself upon
      a stranger&rsquo;s notice, to engage him in cheerful conversation if he could.
      His motive was so obvious, and yet so delicately expressed, that Martin
      felt really grateful to him, and showed him so in the manner of his reply.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;I will not ask you,&rsquo; said this gentleman with a smile, as he rose and
      moved towards him, &lsquo;how you like my country, for I can quite anticipate
      your feeling on that point. But, as I am an American, and consequently
      bound to begin with a question, I&rsquo;ll ask you how you like the colonel?&rsquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;You are so very frank,&rsquo; returned Martin, &lsquo;that I have no hesitation in
      saying I don&rsquo;t like him at all. Though I must add that I am beholden to
      him for his civility in bringing me here&mdash;and arranging for my stay,
      on pretty reasonable terms, by the way,&rsquo; he added, remembering that the
      colonel had whispered him to that effect, before going out.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Not much beholden,&rsquo; said the stranger drily. &lsquo;The colonel occasionally
      boards packet-ships, I have heard, to glean the latest information for his
      journal; and he occasionally brings strangers to board here, I believe,
      with a view to the little percentage which attaches to those good offices;
      and which the hostess deducts from his weekly bill. I don&rsquo;t offend you, I
      hope?&rsquo; he added, seeing that Martin reddened.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;My dear sir,&rsquo; returned Martin, as they shook hands, &lsquo;how is that
      possible! to tell you the truth, I&mdash;am&mdash;&rsquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Yes?&rsquo; said the gentleman, sitting down beside him.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;I am rather at a loss, since I must speak plainly,&rsquo; said Martin, getting
      the better of his hesitation, &lsquo;to know how this colonel escapes being
      beaten.&rsquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Well! He has been beaten once or twice,&rsquo; remarked the gentleman quietly.
      &lsquo;He is one of a class of men, in whom our own Franklin, so long ago as ten
      years before the close of the last century, foresaw our danger and
      disgrace. Perhaps you don&rsquo;t know that Franklin, in very severe terms,
      published his opinion that those who were slandered by such fellows as
      this colonel, having no sufficient remedy in the administration of this
      country&rsquo;s laws or in the decent and right-minded feeling of its people,
      were justified in retorting on such public nuisances by means of a stout
      cudgel?&rsquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;I was not aware of that,&rsquo; said Martin, &lsquo;but I am very glad to know it,
      and I think it worthy of his memory; especially&rsquo;&mdash;here he hesitated
      again.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Go on,&rsquo; said the other, smiling as if he knew what stuck in Martin&rsquo;s
      throat.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Especially,&rsquo; pursued Martin, &lsquo;as I can already understand that it may
      have required great courage, even in his time, to write freely on any
      question which was not a party one in this very free country.&rsquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Some courage, no doubt,&rsquo; returned his new friend. &lsquo;Do you think it would
      require any to do so, now?&rsquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Indeed I think it would; and not a little,&rsquo; said Martin.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;You are right. So very right, that I believe no satirist could breathe
      this air. If another Juvenal or Swift could rise up among us to-morrow, he
      would be hunted down. If you have any knowledge of our literature, and can
      give me the name of any man, American born and bred, who has anatomized
      our follies as a people, and not as this or that party; and who has
      escaped the foulest and most brutal slander, the most inveterate hatred
      and intolerant pursuit; it will be a strange name in my ears, believe me.
      In some cases I could name to you, where a native writer has ventured on
      the most harmless and good-humoured illustrations of our vices or defects,
      it has been found necessary to announce, that in a second edition the
      passage has been expunged, or altered, or explained away, or patched into
      praise.&rsquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;And how has this been brought about?&rsquo; asked Martin, in dismay.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Think of what you have seen and heard to-day, beginning with the
      colonel,&rsquo; said his friend, &lsquo;and ask yourself. How <i>they </i>came about, is
      another question. Heaven forbid that they should be samples of the
      intelligence and virtue of America, but they come uppermost, and in great
      numbers, and too often represent it. Will you walk?&rsquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      There was a cordial candour in his manner, and an engaging confidence that
      it would not be abused; a manly bearing on his own part, and a simple
      reliance on the manly faith of a stranger; which Martin had never seen
      before. He linked his arm readily in that of the American gentleman, and
      they walked out together.
    </p>
    <p>
      It was perhaps to men like this, his new companion, that a traveller of
      honoured name, who trod those shores now nearly forty years ago, and woke
      upon that soil, as many have done since, to blots and stains upon its high
      pretensions, which in the brightness of his distant dreams were lost to
      view, appealed in these words&mdash;
    </p>
<pre xml:space="preserve">
     &lsquo;Oh, but for such, Columbia&rsquo;s days were done;
     Rank without ripeness, quickened without sun,
     Crude at the surface, rotten at the core,
     Her fruits would fall before her spring were o&rsquo;er!&rsquo;

    <h2>
      CHAPTER SEVENTEEN
    </h2>
    <p>
      MARTIN ENLARGES HIS CIRCLE OF AQUAINTANCE; INCREASES HIS STOCK OF WISDOM;
      AND HAS AN EXCELLENT OPPORTUNITY OF COMPARING HIS OWN EXPERIENCES WITH
      THOSE OF LUMMY NED OF THE LIGHT SALISBURY, AS RELATED BY HIS FRIEND MR
      WILLIAM SIMMONS
    </p>
    <p>
      It was characteristic of Martin, that all this while he had either
      forgotten Mark Tapley as completely as if there had been no such person in
      existence, or, if for a moment the figure of that gentleman rose before
      his mental vision, had dismissed it as something by no means of a pressing
      nature, which might be attended to by-and-bye, and could wait his perfect
      leisure. But, being now in the streets again, it occurred to him as just
      coming within the bare limits of possibility that Mr Tapley might, in
      course of time, grow tired of waiting on the threshold of the Rowdy
      Journal Office, so he intimated to his new friend, that if they could
      conveniently walk in that direction, he would be glad to get this piece of
      business off his mind.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;And speaking of business,&rsquo; said Martin, &lsquo;may I ask, in order that I may
      not be behind-hand with questions either, whether your occupation holds
      you to this city, or like myself, you are a visitor here?&rsquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;A visitor,&rsquo; replied his friend. &lsquo;I was &ldquo;raised&rdquo; in the State of
      Massachusetts, and reside there still. My home is in a quiet country town.
      I am not often in these busy places; and my inclination to visit them does
      not increase with our better acquaintance, I assure you.&rsquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;You have been abroad?&rsquo; asked Martin.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Oh yes.&rsquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;And, like most people who travel, have become more than ever attached to
      your home and native country,&rsquo; said Martin, eyeing him curiously.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;To my home&mdash;yes,&rsquo; rejoined his friend. &lsquo;To my native country <i>as</i> my
      home&mdash;yes, also.&rsquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;You imply some reservation,&rsquo; said Martin.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Well,&rsquo; returned his new friend, &lsquo;if you ask me whether I came back here
      with a greater relish for my country&rsquo;s faults; with a greater fondness for
      those who claim (at the rate of so many dollars a day) to be her friends;
      with a cooler indifference to the growth of principles among us in respect
      of public matters and of private dealings between man and man, the
      advocacy of which, beyond the foul atmosphere of a criminal trial, would
      disgrace your own old Bailey lawyers; why, then I answer plainly, No.&rsquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Oh!&rsquo; said Martin; in so exactly the same key as his friend&rsquo;s No, that it
      sounded like an echo.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;If you ask me,&rsquo; his companion pursued, &lsquo;whether I came back here better
      satisfied with a state of things which broadly divides society into two
      classes&mdash;whereof one, the great mass, asserts a spurious
      independence, most miserably dependent for its mean existence on the
      disregard of humanizing conventionalities of manner and social custom, so
      that the coarser a man is, the more distinctly it shall appeal to his
      taste; while the other, disgusted with the low standard thus set up and
      made adaptable to everything, takes refuge among the graces and
      refinements it can bring to bear on private life, and leaves the public
      weal to such fortune as may betide it in the press and uproar of a general
      scramble&mdash;then again I answer, No.&rsquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      And again Martin said &lsquo;Oh!&rsquo; in the same odd way as before, being anxious
      and disconcerted; not so much, to say the truth, on public grounds, as
      with reference to the fading prospects of domestic architecture.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;In a word,&rsquo; resumed the other, &lsquo;I do not find and cannot believe and
      therefore will not allow, that we are a model of wisdom, and an example to
      the world, and the perfection of human reason, and a great deal more to
      the same purpose, which you may hear any hour in the day; simply because
      we began our political life with two inestimable advantages.&rsquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;What were they?&rsquo; asked Martin.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;One, that our history commenced at so late a period as to escape the ages
      of bloodshed and cruelty through which other nations have passed; and so
      had all the light of their probation, and none of its darkness. The other,
      that we have a vast territory, and not&mdash;as yet&mdash;too many people
      on it. These facts considered, we have done little enough, I think.&rsquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Education?&rsquo; suggested Martin, faintly.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Pretty well on that head,&rsquo; said the other, shrugging his shoulders,
      &lsquo;still no mighty matter to boast of; for old countries, and despotic
      countries too, have done as much, if not more, and made less noise about
      it. We shine out brightly in comparison with England, certainly; but hers
      is a very extreme case. You complimented me on my frankness, you know,&rsquo; he
      added, laughing.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Oh! I am not at all astonished at your speaking thus openly when my
      country is in question,&rsquo; returned Martin. &lsquo;It is your plain-speaking in
      reference to your own that surprises me.&rsquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;You will not find it a scarce quality here, I assure you, saving among
      the Colonel Divers, and Jefferson Bricks, and Major Pawkinses; though the
      best of us are something like the man in Goldsmith&rsquo;s comedy, who wouldn&rsquo;t
      suffer anybody but himself to abuse his master. Come!&rsquo; he added. &lsquo;Let us
      talk of something else. You have come here on some design of improving
      your fortune, I dare say; and I should grieve to put you out of heart. I
      am some years older than you, besides; and may, on a few trivial points,
      advise you, perhaps.&rsquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      There was not the least curiosity or impertinence in the manner of this
      offer, which was open-hearted, unaffected, and good-natured. As it was
      next to impossible that he should not have his confidence awakened by a
      deportment so prepossessing and kind, Martin plainly stated what had
      brought him into those parts, and even made the very difficult avowal that
      he was poor. He did not say how poor, it must be admitted, rather throwing
      off the declaration with an air which might have implied that he had money
      enough for six months, instead of as many weeks; but poor he said he was,
      and grateful he said he would be, for any counsel that his friend would
      give him.
    </p>
    <p>
      It would not have been very difficult for any one to see; but it was
      particularly easy for Martin, whose perceptions were sharpened by his
      circumstances, to discern; that the stranger&rsquo;s face grew infinitely longer
      as the domestic-architecture project was developed. Nor, although he made
      a great effort to be as encouraging as possible, could he prevent his head
      from shaking once involuntarily, as if it said in the vulgar tongue, upon
      its own account, &lsquo;No go!&rsquo; But he spoke in a cheerful tone, and said, that
      although there was no such opening as Martin wished, in that city, he
      would make it matter of immediate consideration and inquiry where one was
      most likely to exist; and then he made Martin acquainted with his name,
      which was Bevan; and with his profession, which was physic, though he
      seldom or never practiced; and with other circumstances connected with
      himself and family, which fully occupied the time, until they reached the
      Rowdy Journal Office.

    <p>
      Mr Tapley appeared to be taking his ease on the landing of the first
      floor; for sounds as of some gentleman established in that region
      whistling &lsquo;Rule Britannia&rsquo; with all his might and main, greeted their ears
      before they reached the house. On ascending to the spot from whence this
      music proceeded, they found him recumbent in the midst of a fortification
      of luggage, apparently performing his national anthem for the
      gratification of a grey-haired black man, who sat on one of the outworks
      (a portmanteau), staring intently at Mark, while Mark, with his head
      reclining on his hand, returned the compliment in a thoughtful manner, and
      whistled all the time. He seemed to have recently dined, for his knife, a
      casebottle, and certain broken meats in a handkerchief, lay near at hand.
      He had employed a portion of his leisure in the decoration of the Rowdy
      Journal door, whereon his own initials now appeared in letters nearly half
      a foot long, together with the day of the month in smaller type; the whole
      surrounded by an ornamental border, and looking very fresh and bold.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;I was a&rsquo;most afraid you was lost, sir!&rsquo; cried Mark, rising, and stopping
      the tune at that point where Britons generally are supposed to declare
      (when it is whistled) that they never, never, never&mdash;
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Nothing gone wrong, I hope, sir?&rsquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;No, Mark. Where&rsquo;s your friend?&rsquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;The mad woman, sir?&rsquo; said Mr Tapley. &lsquo;Oh! she&rsquo;s all right, sir.&rsquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Did she find her husband?&rsquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Yes, sir. Leastways she&rsquo;s found his remains,&rsquo; said Mark, correcting
      himself.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;The man&rsquo;s not dead, I hope?&rsquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Not altogether dead, sir,&rsquo; returned Mark; &lsquo;but he&rsquo;s had more fevers and
      agues than is quite reconcilable with being alive. When she didn&rsquo;t see him
      a-waiting for her, I thought she&rsquo;d have died herself, I did!&rsquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Was he not here, then?&rsquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;<i>He</i> wasn&rsquo;t here. There was a feeble old shadow come a-creeping down at
      last, as much like his substance when she know&rsquo;d him, as your shadow when
      it&rsquo;s drawn out to its very finest and longest by the sun, is like you. But
      it was his remains, there&rsquo;s no doubt about that. She took on with joy,
      poor thing, as much as if it had been all of him!&rsquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Had he bought land?&rsquo; asked Mr Bevan.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Ah! He&rsquo;d bought land,&rsquo; said Mark, shaking his head, &lsquo;and paid for it too.
      Every sort of nateral advantage was connected with it, the agents said;
      and there certainly was <i>one</i>, quite unlimited. No end to the water!&rsquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;It&rsquo;s a thing he couldn&rsquo;t have done without, I suppose,&rsquo; observed Martin,
      peevishly.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Certainly not, sir. There it was, any way; always turned on, and no
      water-rate. Independent of three or four slimy old rivers close by, it
      varied on the farm from four to six foot deep in the dry season. He
      couldn&rsquo;t say how deep it was in the rainy time, for he never had anything
      long enough to sound it with.&rsquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Is this true?&rsquo; asked Martin of his companion.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Extremely probable,&rsquo; he answered. &lsquo;Some Mississippi or Missouri lot, I
      dare say.&rsquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;However,&rsquo; pursued Mark, &lsquo;he came from I-don&rsquo;t-know-where-and-all, down to
      New York here, to meet his wife and children; and they started off again
      in a steamboat this blessed afternoon, as happy to be along with each
      other as if they were going to Heaven. I should think they was, pretty
      straight, if I may judge from the poor man&rsquo;s looks.&rsquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;And may I ask,&rsquo; said Martin, glancing, but not with any displeasure, from
      Mark to the negro, &lsquo;who this gentleman is? Another friend of yours?&rsquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Why sir,&rsquo; returned Mark, taking him aside, and speaking confidentially in
      his ear, &lsquo;he&rsquo;s a man of colour, sir!&rsquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Do you take me for a blind man,&rsquo; asked Martin, somewhat impatiently,
      &lsquo;that you think it necessary to tell me that, when his face is the
      blackest that ever was seen?&rsquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;No, no; when I say a man of colour,&rsquo; returned Mark, &lsquo;I mean that he&rsquo;s
      been one of them as there&rsquo;s picters of in the shops. A man and a brother,
      you know, sir,&rsquo; said Mr Tapley, favouring his master with a significant
      indication of the figure so often represented in tracts and cheap prints.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;A slave!&rsquo; cried Martin, in a whisper.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Ah!&rsquo; said Mark in the same tone. &lsquo;Nothing else. A slave. Why, when that
      there man was young&mdash;don&rsquo;t look at him while I&rsquo;m a-telling it&mdash;he
      was shot in the leg; gashed in the arm; scored in his live limbs, like
      crimped fish; beaten out of shape; had his neck galled with an iron
      collar, and wore iron rings upon his wrists and ankles. The marks are on
      him to this day. When I was having my dinner just now, he stripped off his
      coat, and took away my appetite.&rsquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Is <i>this </i>true?&rsquo; asked Martin of his friend, who stood beside them.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;I have no reason to doubt it,&rsquo; he answered, shaking his head &lsquo;It very
      often is.&rsquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Bless you,&rsquo; said Mark, &lsquo;I know it is, from hearing his whole story. That
      master died; so did his second master from having his head cut open with a
      hatchet by another slave, who, when he&rsquo;d done it, went and drowned
      himself; then he got a better one; in years and years he saved up a little
      money, and bought his freedom, which he got pretty cheap at last, on
      account of his strength being nearly gone, and he being ill. Then he come
      here. And now he&rsquo;s a-saving up to treat himself, afore he dies, to one
      small purchase&mdash;it&rsquo;s nothing to speak of. Only his own daughter;
      that&rsquo;s all!&rsquo; cried Mr Tapley, becoming excited. &lsquo;Liberty for ever! Hurrah!
      Hail, Columbia!&rsquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Hush!&rsquo; cried Martin, clapping his hand upon his mouth; &lsquo;and don&rsquo;t be an
      idiot. What is he doing here?&rsquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Waiting to take our luggage off upon a truck,&rsquo; said Mark. &lsquo;He&rsquo;d have come
      for it by-and-bye, but I engaged him for a very reasonable charge (out of
      my own pocket) to sit along with me and make me jolly; and I am jolly; and
      if I was rich enough to contract with him to wait upon me once a day, to
      be looked at, I&rsquo;d never be anything else.&rsquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      The fact may cause a solemn impeachment of Mark&rsquo;s veracity, but it must be
      admitted nevertheless, that there was that in his face and manner at the
      moment, which militated strongly against this emphatic declaration of his
      state of mind.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Lord love you, sir,&rsquo; he added, &lsquo;they&rsquo;re so fond of Liberty in this part
      of the globe, that they buy her and sell her and carry her to market with
      &lsquo;em. They&rsquo;ve such a passion for Liberty, that they can&rsquo;t help taking
      liberties with her. That&rsquo;s what it&rsquo;s owing to.&rsquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Very well,&rsquo; said Martin, wishing to change the theme. &lsquo;Having come to
      that conclusion, Mark, perhaps you&rsquo;ll attend to me. The place to which the
      luggage is to go is printed on this card. Mrs Pawkins&rsquo;s Boarding House.&rsquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Mrs Pawkins&rsquo;s boarding-house,&rsquo; repeated Mark. &lsquo;Now, Cicero.&rsquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Is that his name?&rsquo; asked Martin
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;That&rsquo;s his name, sir,&rsquo; rejoined Mark. And the negro grinning assent from
      under a leathern portmanteau, than which his own face was many shades
      deeper, hobbled downstairs with his portion of their worldly goods; Mark
      Tapley having already gone before with his share.
    </p>
    <p>
      Martin and his friend followed them to the door below, and were about to
      pursue their walk, when the latter stopped, and asked, with some
      hesitation, whether that young man was to be trusted?
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Mark! oh certainly! with anything.&rsquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;You don&rsquo;t understand me&mdash;I think he had better go with us. He is an
      honest fellow, and speaks his mind so very plainly.&rsquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Why, the fact is,&rsquo; said Martin, smiling, &lsquo;that being unaccustomed to a
      free republic, he is used to do so.&rsquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;I think he had better go with us,&rsquo; returned the other. &lsquo;He may get into
      some trouble otherwise. This is not a slave State; but I am ashamed to say
      that a spirit of Tolerance is not so common anywhere in these latitudes as
      the form. We are not remarkable for behaving very temperately to each
      other when we differ; but to strangers! no, I really think he had better
      go with us.&rsquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      Martin called to him immediately to be of their party; so Cicero and the
      truck went one way, and they three went another.
    </p>
    <p>
      They walked about the city for two or three hours; seeing it from the best
      points of view, and pausing in the principal streets, and before such
      public buildings as Mr Bevan pointed out. Night then coming on apace,
      Martin proposed that they should adjourn to Mrs Pawkins&rsquo;s establishment
      for coffee; but in this he was overruled by his new acquaintance, who
      seemed to have set his heart on carrying him, though it were only for an
      hour, to the house of a friend of his who lived hard by. Feeling (however
      disinclined he was, being weary) that it would be in bad taste, and not
      very gracious, to object that he was unintroduced, when this open-hearted
      gentleman was so ready to be his sponsor, Martin&mdash;for once in his
      life, at all events&mdash;sacrificed his own will and pleasure to the
      wishes of another, and consented with a fair grace. So travelling had done
      him that much good, already.
    </p>
    <p>
      Mr Bevan knocked at the door of a very neat house of moderate size, from
      the parlour windows of which, lights were shining brightly into the now
      dark street. It was quickly opened by a man with such a thoroughly Irish
      face, that it seemed as if he ought, as a matter of right and principle,
      to be in rags, and could have no sort of business to be looking cheerfully
      at anybody out of a whole suit of clothes.
    </p>
    <p>
      Commending Mark to the care of this phenomenon&mdash;for such he may be
      said to have been in Martin&rsquo;s eyes&mdash;Mr Bevan led the way into the
      room which had shed its cheerfulness upon the street, to whose occupants
      he introduced Mr Chuzzlewit as a gentleman from England, whose
      acquaintance he had recently had the pleasure to make. They gave him
      welcome in all courtesy and politeness; and in less than five minutes&rsquo;
      time he found himself sitting very much at his ease by the fireside, and
      becoming vastly well acquainted with the whole family.
    </p>
    <p>
      There were two young ladies&mdash;one eighteen; the other twenty&mdash;both
      very slender, but very pretty; their mother, who looked, as Martin thought
      much older and more faded than she ought to have looked; and their
      grandmother, a little sharp-eyed, quick old woman, who seemed to have got
      past that stage, and to have come all right again. Besides these, there
      were the young ladies&rsquo; father, and the young ladies&rsquo; brother; the first
      engaged in mercantile affairs; the second, a student at college; both, in
      a certain cordiality of manner, like his own friend, and not unlike him in
      face. Which was no great wonder, for it soon appeared that he was their
      near relation. Martin could not help tracing the family pedigree from the
      two young ladies, because they were foremost in his thoughts; not only
      from being, as aforesaid, very pretty, but by reason of their wearing
      miraculously small shoes, and the thinnest possible silk stockings; the
      which their rocking-chairs developed to a distracting extent.
    </p>
    <p>
      There is no doubt that it was a monstrous comfortable circumstance to be
      sitting in a snug, well-furnished room, warmed by a cheerful fire, and
      full of various pleasant decorations, including four small shoes, and the
      like amount of silk stockings, and&mdash;yes, why not?&mdash;the feet and
      legs therein enshrined. And there is no doubt that Martin was monstrous
      well-disposed to regard his position in that light, after his recent
      experience of the Screw, and of Mrs Pawkins&rsquo;s boarding-house. The
      consequence was that he made himself very agreeable indeed; and by the
      time the tea and coffee arrived (with sweet preserves, and cunning
      tea-cakes in its train), was in a highly genial state, and much esteemed
      by the whole family.
    </p>
    <p>
      Another delightful circumstance turned up before the first cup of tea was
      drunk. The whole family had been in England. There was a pleasant thing!
      But Martin was not quite so glad of this, when he found that they knew all
      the great dukes, lords, viscounts, marquesses, duchesses, knights, and
      baronets, quite affectionately, and were beyond everything interested in
      the least particular concerning them. However, when they asked, after the
      wearer of this or that coronet, and said, &lsquo;Was he quite well?&rsquo; Martin
      answered, &lsquo;Yes, oh yes. Never better;&rsquo; and when they said, &lsquo;his lordship&rsquo;s
      mother, the duchess, was she much changed?&rsquo; Martin said, &lsquo;Oh dear no, they
      would know her anywhere, if they saw her to-morrow;&rsquo; and so got on pretty
      well. In like manner when the young ladies questioned him touching the
      Gold Fish in that Grecian fountain in such and such a nobleman&rsquo;s
      conservatory, and whether there were as many as there used to be, he
      gravely reported, after mature consideration, that there must be at least
      twice as many; and as to the exotics, &lsquo;Oh! well! it was of no use talking
      about <i>them</i>; they must be seen to be believed;&rsquo; which improved state of
      circumstances reminded the family of the splendour of that brilliant
      festival (comprehending the whole British Peerage and Court Calendar) to
      which they were specially invited, and which indeed had been partly given
      in their honour; and recollections of what Mr Norris the father had said
      to the marquess, and of what Mrs Norris the mother had said to the
      marchioness, and of what the marquess and marchioness had both said, when
      they said that upon their words and honours they wished Mr Norris the
      father and Mrs Norris the mother, and the Misses Norris the daughters, and
      Mr Norris Junior, the son, would only take up their permanent residence in
      England, and give them the pleasure of their everlasting friendship,
      occupied a very considerable time.
    </p>
    <p>
      Martin thought it rather stange, and in some sort inconsistent, that
      during the whole of these narrations, and in the very meridian of their
      enjoyment thereof, both Mr Norris the father, and Mr Norris Junior, the
      son (who corresponded, every post, with four members of the English
      Peerage), enlarged upon the inestimable advantage of having no such
      arbitrary distinctions in that enlightened land, where there were no
      noblemen but nature&rsquo;s noblemen, and where all society was based on one
      broad level of brotherly love and natural equality. Indeed, Mr Norris the
      father gradually expanding into an oration on this swelling theme, was
      becoming tedious, when Mr Bevan diverted his thoughts by happening to make
      some causal inquiry relative to the occupier of the next house; in reply
      to which, this same Mr Norris the father observed, that &lsquo;that person
      entertained religious opinions of which he couldn&rsquo;t approve; and therefore
      he hadn&rsquo;t the honour of knowing the gentleman.&rsquo; Mrs Norris the mother
      added another reason of her own, the same in effect, but varying in words;
      to wit, that she believed the people were well enough in their way, but
      they were not genteel.
    </p>
    <p>
      Another little trait came out, which impressed itself on Martin forcibly.
      Mr Bevan told them about Mark and the negro, and then it appeared that all
      the Norrises were abolitionists. It was a great relief to hear this, and
      Martin was so much encouraged on finding himself in such company, that he
      expressed his sympathy with the oppressed and wretched blacks. Now, one of
      the young ladies&mdash;the prettiest and most delicate&mdash;was mightily
      amused at the earnestness with which he spoke; and on his craving leave to
      ask her why, was quite unable for a time to speak for laughing. As soon
      however as she could, she told him that the negroes were such a funny
      people, so excessively ludicrous in their manners and appearance, that it
      was wholly impossible for those who knew them well, to associate any
      serious ideas with such a very absurd part of the creation. Mr Norris the
      father, and Mrs Norris the mother, and Miss Norris the sister, and Mr
      Norris Junior the brother, and even Mrs Norris Senior the grandmother,
      were all of this opinion, and laid it down as an absolute matter of fact&mdash;as
      if there were nothing in suffering and slavery, grim enough to cast a
      solemn air on any human animal; though it were as ridiculous, physically,
      as the most grotesque of apes, or morally, as the mildest Nimrod among
      tuft-hunting republicans!
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;In short,&rsquo; said Mr Norris the father, settling the question comfortably,
      &lsquo;there is a natural antipathy between the races.&rsquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Extending,&rsquo; said Martin&rsquo;s friend, in a low voice, &lsquo;to the cruellest of
      tortures, and the bargain and sale of unborn generations.&rsquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      Mr Norris the son said nothing, but he made a wry face, and dusted his
      fingers as Hamlet might after getting rid of Yorick&rsquo;s skull; just as
      though he had that moment touched a negro, and some of the black had come
      off upon his hands.
    </p>
    <p>
      In order that their talk might fall again into its former pleasant
      channel, Martin dropped the subject, with a shrewd suspicion that it would
      be a dangerous theme to revive under the best of circumstances; and again
      addressed himself to the young ladies, who were very gorgeously attired in
      very beautiful colours, and had every article of dress on the same
      extensive scale as the little shoes and the thin silk stockings. This
      suggested to him that they were great proficients in the French fashions,
      which soon turned out to be the case, for though their information
      appeared to be none of the newest, it was very extensive; and the eldest
      sister in particular, who was distinguished by a talent for metaphysics,
      the laws of hydraulic pressure, and the rights of human kind, had a novel
      way of combining these acquirements and bringing them to bear on any
      subject from Millinery to the Millennium, both inclusive, which was at
      once improving and remarkable; so much so, in short, that it was usually
      observed to reduce foreigners to a state of temporary insanity in five
      minutes.
    </p>
    <p>
      Martin felt his reason going; and as a means of saving himself, besought
      the other sister (seeing a piano in the room) to sing. With this request
      she willingly complied; and a bravura concert, solely sustained by the
      Misses Noriss, presently began. They sang in all languages&mdash;except
      their own. German, French, Italian, Spanish, Portuguese, Swiss; but
      nothing native; nothing so low as native. For, in this respect, languages
      are like many other travellers&mdash;ordinary and commonplace enough at
      home, but &lsquo;specially genteel abroad.
    </p>
    <p>
      There is little doubt that in course of time the Misses Norris would have
      come to Hebrew, if they had not been interrupted by an announcement from
      the Irishman, who, flinging open the door, cried in a loud voice&mdash;
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Jiniral Fladdock!&rsquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;My!&rsquo; cried the sisters, desisting suddenly. &lsquo;The general come back!&rsquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      As they made the exclamation, the general, attired in full uniform for a
      ball, came darting in with such precipitancy that, hitching his boot in
      the carpet, and getting his sword between his legs, he came down headlong,
      and presented a curious little bald place on the crown of his head to the
      eyes of the astonished company. Nor was this the worst of it; for being
      rather corpulent and very tight, the general being down, could not get up
      again, but lay there writhing and doing such things with his boots, as
      there is no other instance of in military history.
    </p>
    <p>
      Of course there was an immediate rush to his assistance; and the general
      was promptly raised. But his uniform was so fearfully and wonderfully
      made, that he came up stiff and without a bend in him like a dead Clown,
      and had no command whatever of himself until he was put quite flat upon
      the soles of his feet, when he became animated as by a miracle, and moving
      edgewise that he might go in a narrower compass and be in less danger of
      fraying the gold lace on his epaulettes by brushing them against anything,
      advanced with a smiling visage to salute the lady of the house.
    </p>
    <p>
      To be sure, it would have been impossible for the family to testify purer
      delight and joy than at this unlooked-for appearance of General Fladdock!
      The general was as warmly received as if New York had been in a state of
      siege and no other general was to be got for love or money. He shook hands
      with the Norrises three times all round, and then reviewed them from a
      little distance as a brave commander might, with his ample cloak drawn
      forward over the right shoulder and thrown back upon the left side to
      reveal his manly breast.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;And do I then,&rsquo; cried the general, &lsquo;once again behold the choicest
      spirits of my country!&rsquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Yes,&rsquo; said Mr Norris the father. &lsquo;Here we are, general.&rsquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      Then all the Norrises pressed round the general, inquiring how and where
      he had been since the date of his letter, and how he had enjoyed himself
      in foreign parts, and particularly and above all, to what extent he had
      become acquainted with the great dukes, lords, viscounts, marquesses,
      duchesses, knights, and baronets, in whom the people of those benighted
      countries had delight.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Well, then, don&rsquo;t ask me,&rsquo; said the general, holding up his hand. &lsquo;I was
      among &lsquo;em all the time, and have got public journals in my trunk with my
      name printed&rsquo;&mdash;he lowered his voice and was very impressive here&mdash;&lsquo;among
      the fashionable news. But, oh, the conventionalities of that a-mazing
      Europe!&rsquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Ah!&rsquo; cried Mr Norris the father, giving his head a melancholy shake, and
      looking towards Martin as though he would say, &lsquo;I can&rsquo;t deny it, sir. I
      would if I could.&rsquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;The limited diffusion of a moral sense in that country!&rsquo; exclaimed the
      general. &lsquo;The absence of a moral dignity in man!&rsquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Ah!&rsquo; sighed all the Norrises, quite overwhelmed with despondency.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;I couldn&rsquo;t have realised it,&rsquo; pursued the general, &lsquo;without being located
      on the spot. Norris, your imagination is the imagination of a strong man,
      but <i>you </i>couldn&rsquo;t have realised it, without being located on the spot!&rsquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Never,&rsquo; said Mr Norris.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;The ex-clusiveness, the pride, the form, the ceremony,&rsquo; exclaimed the
      general, emphasizing the article more vigorously at every repetition. &lsquo;The
      artificial barriers set up between man and man; the division of the human
      race into court cards and plain cards, of every denomination&mdash;into
      clubs, diamonds, spades&mdash;anything but heart!&rsquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Ah!&rsquo; cried the whole family. &lsquo;Too true, general!&rsquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;But stay!&rsquo; cried Mr Norris the father, taking him by the arm. &lsquo;Surely you
      crossed in the Screw, general?&rsquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Well! so I did,&rsquo; was the reply.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Possible!&rsquo; cried the young ladies. &lsquo;Only think!&rsquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      The general seemed at a loss to understand why his having come home in the
      Screw should occasion such a sensation, nor did he seem at all clearer on
      the subject when Mr Norris, introducing him to Martin, said:
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;A fellow-passenger of yours, I think?&rsquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Of mine?&rsquo; exclaimed the general; &lsquo;No!&rsquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      He had never seen Martin, but Martin had seen him, and recognized him, now
      that they stood face to face, as the gentleman who had stuck his hands in
      his pockets towards the end of the voyage, and walked the deck with his
      nostrils dilated.
    </p>
    <p>
      Everybody looked at Martin. There was no help for it. The truth must out.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;I came over in the same ship as the general,&rsquo; said Martin, &lsquo;but not in
      the same cabin. It being necessary for me to observe strict economy, I
      took my passage in the steerage.&rsquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      If the general had been carried up bodily to a loaded cannon, and required
      to let it off that moment, he could not have been in a state of greater
      consternation than when he heard these words. He, Fladdock&mdash;Fladdock
      in full militia uniform, Fladdock the General, Fladdock, the caressed of
      foreign noblemen&mdash;expected to know a fellow who had come over in the
      steerage of line-of-packet ship, at the cost of four pound ten! And
      meeting that fellow in the very sanctuary of New York fashion, and
      nestling in the bosom of the New York aristocracy! He almost laid his hand
      upon his sword.
    </p>
    <p>
      A death-like stillness fell upon the Norisses. If this story should get
      wind, their country relation had, by his imprudence, for ever disgraced
      them. They were the bright particular stars of an exalted New York sphere.
      There were other fashionable spheres above them, and other fashionable
      spheres below, and none of the stars in any one of these spheres had
      anything to say to the stars in any other of these spheres. But, through
      all the spheres it would go forth that the Norrises, deceived by
      gentlemanly manners and appearances, had, falling from their high estate,
      &lsquo;received&rsquo; a dollarless and unknown man. O guardian eagle of the pure
      Republic, had they lived for this!
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;You will allow me,&rsquo; said Martin, after a terrible silence, &lsquo;to take my
      leave. I feel that I am the cause of at least as much embarrassment here,
      as I have brought upon myself. But I am bound, before I go, to exonerate
      this gentleman, who, in introducing me to such society, was quite ignorant
      of my unworthiness, I assure you.&rsquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      With that he made his bow to the Norrises, and walked out like a man of
      snow; very cool externally, but pretty hot within.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Come, come,&rsquo; said Mr Norris the father, looking with a pale face on the
      assembled circle as Martin closed the door, &lsquo;the young man has this night
      beheld a refinement of social manner, and an easy magnificence of social
      decoration, to which he is a stranger in his own country. Let us hope it
      may awake a moral sense within him.&rsquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      If that peculiarly transatlantic article, a moral sense&mdash;for, if
      native statesmen, orators, and pamphleteers, are to be believed, America
      quite monopolises the commodity&mdash;if that peculiarly transatlantic
      article be supposed to include a benevolent love of all mankind, certainly
      Martin&rsquo;s would have borne, just then, a deal of waking. As he strode along
      the street, with Mark at his heels, his immoral sense was in active
      operation; prompting him to the utterance of some rather sanguinary
      remarks, which it was well for his own credit that nobody overheard. He
      had so far cooled down, however, that he had begun to laugh at the
      recollection of these incidents, when he heard another step behind him,
      and turning round encountered his friend Bevan, quite out of breath.
    </p>
    <p>
      He drew his arm through Martin&rsquo;s, and entreating him to walk slowly, was
      silent for some minutes. At length he said:
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;I hope you exonerate me in another sense?&rsquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;How do you mean?&rsquo; asked Martin.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;I hope you acquit me of intending or foreseeing the termination of our
      visit. But I scarcely need ask you that.&rsquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Scarcely indeed,&rsquo; said Martin. &lsquo;I am the more beholden to you for your
      kindness, when I find what kind of stuff the good citizens here are made
      of.&rsquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;I reckon,&rsquo; his friend returned, &lsquo;that they are made of pretty much the
      same stuff as other folks, if they would but own it, and not set up on
      false pretences.&rsquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;In good faith, that&rsquo;s true,&rsquo; said Martin.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;I dare say,&rsquo; resumed his friend, &lsquo;you might have such a scene as that in
      an English comedy, and not detect any gross improbability or anomaly in
      the matter of it?&rsquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Yes, indeed!&rsquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Doubtless it is more ridiculous here than anywhere else,&rsquo; said his
      companion; &lsquo;but our professions are to blame for that. So far as I myself
      am concerned, I may add that I was perfectly aware from the first that you
      came over in the steerage, for I had seen the list of passengers, and knew
      it did not comprise your name.&rsquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;I feel more obliged to you than before,&rsquo; said Martin.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Norris is a very good fellow in his way,&rsquo; observed Mr Bevan.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Is he?&rsquo; said Martin drily.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Oh yes! there are a hundred good points about him. If you or anybody else
      addressed him as another order of being, and sued to him <i>In Forma
            Pauperis</i>, he would be all kindness and consideration.&rsquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;I needn&rsquo;t have travelled three thousand miles from home to find such a
      character as <i>that</i>,&rsquo; said Martin. Neither he nor his friend said anything
      more on the way back; each appearing to find sufficient occupation in his
      own thoughts.
    </p>
    <p>
      The tea, or the supper, or whatever else they called the evening meal, was
      over when they reached the Major&rsquo;s; but the cloth, ornamented with a few
      additional smears and stains, was still upon the table. At one end of the
      board Mrs Jefferson Brick and two other ladies were drinking tea; out of
      the ordinary course, evidently, for they were bonneted and shawled, and
      seemed to have just come home. By the light of three flaring candles of
      different lengths, in as many candlesticks of different patterns, the room
      showed to almost as little advantage as in broad day.
    </p>
    <p>
      These ladies were all three talking together in a very loud tone when
      Martin and his friend entered; but seeing those gentlemen, they stopped
      directly, and became excessively genteel, not to say frosty. As they went
      on to exchange some few remarks in whispers, the very water in the teapot
      might have fallen twenty degrees in temperature beneath their chilling
      coldness.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Have you been to meeting, Mrs Brick?&rsquo; asked Martin&rsquo;s friend, with
      something of a roguish twinkle in his eye.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;To lecture, sir.&rsquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;I beg your pardon. I forgot. You don&rsquo;t go to meeting, I think?&rsquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      Here the lady on the right of Mrs Brick gave a pious cough as much as to
      say &lsquo;I do!&rsquo;&mdash;as, indeed, she did nearly every night in the week.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;A good discourse, ma&rsquo;am?&rsquo; asked Mr Bevan, addressing this lady.
    </p>
    <p>
      The lady raised her eyes in a pious manner, and answered &lsquo;Yes.&rsquo; She had
      been much comforted by some good, strong, peppery doctrine, which
      satisfactorily disposed of all her friends and acquaintances, and quite
      settled their business. Her bonnet, too, had far outshone every bonnet in
      the congregation; so she was tranquil on all accounts.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;What course of lectures are you attending now, ma&rsquo;am?&rsquo; said Martin&rsquo;s
      friend, turning again to Mrs Brick.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;The Philosophy of the Soul, on Wednesdays.&rsquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;On Mondays?&rsquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;The Philosophy of Crime.&rsquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;On Fridays?&rsquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;The Philosophy of Vegetables.&rsquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;You have forgotten Thursdays; the Philosophy of Government, my dear,&rsquo;
      observed the third lady.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;No,&rsquo; said Mrs Brick. &lsquo;That&rsquo;s Tuesdays.&rsquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;So it is!&rsquo; cried the lady. &lsquo;The Philosophy of Matter on Thursdays, of
      course.&rsquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;You see, Mr Chuzzlewit, our ladies are fully employed,&rsquo; said Bevan.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Indeed you have reason to say so,&rsquo; answered Martin. &lsquo;Between these very
      grave pursuits abroad, and family duties at home, their time must be
      pretty well engrossed.&rsquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      Martin stopped here, for he saw that the ladies regarded him with no very
      great favour, though what he had done to deserve the disdainful expression
      which appeared in their faces he was at a loss to divine. But on their
      going upstairs to their bedrooms&mdash;which they very soon did&mdash;Mr
      Bevan informed him that domestic drudgery was far beneath the exalted
      range of these Philosophers, and that the chances were a hundred to one
      that not one of the three could perform the easiest woman&rsquo;s work for
      herself, or make the simplest article of dress for any of her children.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Though whether they might not be better employed with such blunt
      instruments as knitting-needles than with these edge-tools,&rsquo; he said, &lsquo;is
      another question; but I can answer for one thing&mdash;they don&rsquo;t often
      cut themselves. Devotions and lectures are our balls and concerts. They go
      to these places of resort, as an escape from monotony; look at each
      other&rsquo;s clothes; and come home again.&rsquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;When you say &ldquo;home,&rdquo; do you mean a house like this?&rsquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Very often. But I see you are tired to death, and will wish you good
      night. We will discuss your projects in the morning. You cannot but feel
      already that it is useless staying here, with any hope of advancing them.
      You will have to go further.&rsquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;And to fare worse?&rsquo; said Martin, pursuing the old adage.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Well, I hope not. But sufficient for the day, you know&mdash;good night&rsquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      They shook hands heartily and separated. As soon as Martin was left alone,
      the excitement of novelty and change which had sustained him through all
      the fatigues of the day, departed; and he felt so thoroughly dejected and
      worn out, that he even lacked the energy to crawl upstairs to bed.
    </p>
    <p>
      In twelve or fifteen hours, how great a change had fallen on his hopes and
      sanguine plans! New and strange as he was to the ground on which he stood,
      and to the air he breathed, he could not&mdash;recalling all that he had
      crowded into that one day&mdash;but entertain a strong misgiving that his
      enterprise was doomed. Rash and ill-considered as it had often looked on
      shipboard, but had never seemed on shore, it wore a dismal aspect, now,
      that frightened him. Whatever thoughts he called up to his aid, they came
      upon him in depressing and discouraging shapes, and gave him no relief.
      Even the diamonds on his finger sparkled with the brightness of tears, and
      had no ray of hope in all their brilliant lustre.
    </p>
    <p>
      He continued to sit in gloomy rumination by the stove, unmindful of the
      boarders who dropped in one by one from their stores and counting-houses,
      or the neighbouring bar-rooms, and, after taking long pulls from a great
      white waterjug upon the sideboard, and lingering with a kind of hideous
      fascination near the brass spittoons, lounged heavily to bed; until at
      length Mark Tapley came and shook him by the arm, supposing him asleep.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Mark!&rsquo; he cried, starting.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;All right, sir,&rsquo; said that cheerful follower, snuffing with his fingers
      the candle he bore. &lsquo;It ain&rsquo;t a very large bed, your&rsquo;n, sir; and a man as
      wasn&rsquo;t thirsty might drink, afore breakfast, all the water you&rsquo;ve got to
      wash in, and afterwards eat the towel. But you&rsquo;ll sleep without rocking
      to-night, sir.&rsquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;I feel as if the house were on the sea&rsquo; said Martin, staggering when he
      rose; &lsquo;and am utterly wretched.&rsquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;I&rsquo;m as jolly as a sandboy, myself, sir,&rsquo; said Mark. &lsquo;But, Lord, I have
      reason to be! I ought to have been born here; that&rsquo;s my opinion. Take care
      how you go&rsquo;&mdash;for they were now ascending the stairs. &lsquo;You recollect
      the gentleman aboard the Screw as had the very small trunk, sir?&rsquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;The valise? Yes.&rsquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Well, sir, there&rsquo;s been a delivery of clean clothes from the wash
      to-night, and they&rsquo;re put outside the bedroom doors here. If you take
      notice as we go up, what a very few shirts there are, and what a many
      fronts, you&rsquo;ll penetrate the mystery of his packing.&rsquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      But Martin was too weary and despondent to take heed of anything, so had
      no interest in this discovery. Mr Tapley, nothing dashed by his
      indifference, conducted him to the top of the house, and into the
      bed-chamber prepared for his reception; which was a very little narrow
      room, with half a window in it; a bedstead like a chest without a lid; two
      chairs; a piece of carpet, such as shoes are commonly tried upon at a
      ready-made establishment in England; a little looking-glass nailed against
      the wall; and a washing-table, with a jug and ewer, that might have been
      mistaken for a milk-pot and slop-basin.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;I suppose they polish themselves with a dry cloth in this country,&rsquo; said
      Mark. &lsquo;They&rsquo;ve certainly got a touch of the &lsquo;phoby, sir.&rsquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;I wish you would pull off my boots for me,&rsquo; said Martin, dropping into
      one of the chairs &lsquo;I am quite knocked up&mdash;dead beat, Mark.&rsquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;You won&rsquo;t say that to-morrow morning, sir,&rsquo; returned Mr Tapley; &lsquo;nor even
      to-night, sir, when you&rsquo;ve made a trial of this.&rsquo; With which he produced a
      very large tumbler, piled up to the brim with little blocks of clear
      transparent ice, through which one or two thin slices of lemon, and a
      golden liquid of delicious appearance, appealed from the still depths
      below, to the loving eye of the spectator.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;What do you call this?&rsquo; said Martin.
    </p>
    <p>
      But Mr Tapley made no answer; merely plunging a reed into the mixture&mdash;which
      caused a pleasant commotion among the pieces of ice&mdash;and signifying
      by an expressive gesture that it was to be pumped up through that agency
      by the enraptured drinker.
    </p>
    <p>
      Martin took the glass with an astonished look; applied his lips to the
      reed; and cast up his eyes once in ecstasy. He paused no more until the
      goblet was drained to the last drop.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;There, sir!&rsquo; said Mark, taking it from him with a triumphant face; &lsquo;if
      ever you should happen to be dead beat again, when I ain&rsquo;t in the way, all
      you&rsquo;ve got to do is to ask the nearest man to go and fetch a cobbler.&rsquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;To go and fetch a cobbler?&rsquo; repeated Martin.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;This wonderful invention, sir,&rsquo; said Mark, tenderly patting the empty
      glass, &lsquo;is called a cobbler. Sherry cobbler when you name it long;
      cobbler, when you name it short. Now you&rsquo;re equal to having your boots
      took off, and are, in every particular worth mentioning, another man.&rsquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      Having delivered himself of this solemn preface, he brought the bootjack.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Mind! I am not going to relapse, Mark,&rsquo; said Martin; &lsquo;but, good Heaven,
      if we should be left in some wild part of this country without goods or
      money!&rsquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Well, sir!&rsquo; replied the imperturbable Tapley; &lsquo;from what we&rsquo;ve seen
      already, I don&rsquo;t know whether, under those circumstances, we shouldn&rsquo;t do
      better in the wild parts than in the tame ones.&rsquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Oh, Tom Pinch, Tom Pinch!&rsquo; said Martin, in a thoughtful tone; &lsquo;what would
      I give to be again beside you, and able to hear your voice, though it were
      even in the old bedroom at Pecksniff&rsquo;s!&rsquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Oh, Dragon, Dragon!&rsquo; echoed Mark, cheerfully, &lsquo;if there warn&rsquo;t any water
      between you and me, and nothing faint-hearted-like in going back, I don&rsquo;t
      know that I mightn&rsquo;t say the same. But here am I, Dragon, in New York,
      America; and there are you in Wiltshire, Europe; and there&rsquo;s a fortune to
      make, Dragon, and a beautiful young lady to make it for; and whenever you
      go to see the Monument, Dragon, you mustn&rsquo;t give in on the doorsteps, or
      you&rsquo;ll never get up to the top!&rsquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Wisely said, Mark,&rsquo; cried Martin. &lsquo;We must look forward.&rsquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;In all the story-books as ever I read, sir, the people as looked backward
      was turned into stones,&rsquo; replied Mark; &lsquo;and my opinion always was, that
      they brought it on themselves, and it served &lsquo;em right. I wish you good
      night, sir, and pleasant dreams!&rsquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;They must be of home, then,&rsquo; said Martin, as he lay down in bed.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;So I say, too,&rsquo; whispered Mark Tapley, when he was out of hearing and in
      his own room; &lsquo;for if there don&rsquo;t come a time afore we&rsquo;re well out of
      this, when there&rsquo;ll be a little more credit in keeping up one&rsquo;s jollity,
      I&rsquo;m a United Statesman!&rsquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      Leaving them to blend and mingle in their sleep the shadows of objects
      afar off, as they take fantastic shapes upon the wall in the dim light of
      thought without control, be it the part of this slight chronicle&mdash;a
      dream within a dream&mdash;as rapidly to change the scene, and cross the
      ocean to the English shore.

      CHAPTER EIGHTEEN
    </h2>
    <p>
      DOES BUSINESS WITH THE HOUSE OF ANTHONY CHUZZLEWIT AND SON, FROM WHICH ONE
      OF THE PARTNERS RETIRES UNEXPECTEDLY
    </p>
    <p>
      Change begets change. Nothing propagates so fast. If a man habituated to a
      narrow circle of cares and pleasures, out of which he seldom travels, step
      beyond it, though for never so brief a space, his departure from the
      monotonous scene on which he has been an actor of importance, would seem
      to be the signal for instant confusion. As if, in the gap he had left, the
      wedge of change were driven to the head, rending what was a solid mass to
      fragments, things cemented and held together by the usages of years, burst
      asunder in as many weeks. The mine which Time has slowly dug beneath
      familiar objects is sprung in an instant; and what was rock before,
      becomes but sand and dust.
    </p>
    <p>
      Most men, at one time or other, have proved this in some degree. The
      extent to which the natural laws of change asserted their supremacy in
      that limited sphere of action which Martin had deserted, shall be
      faithfully set down in these pages.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;What a cold spring it is!&rsquo; whimpered old Anthony, drawing near the
      evening fire, &lsquo;It was a warmer season, sure, when I was young!&rsquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;You needn&rsquo;t go scorching your clothes into holes, whether it was or not,&rsquo;
      observed the amiable Jonas, raising his eyes from yesterday&rsquo;s newspaper,
      &lsquo;Broadcloth ain&rsquo;t so cheap as that comes to.&rsquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;A good lad!&rsquo; cried the father, breathing on his cold hands, and feebly
      chafing them against each other. &lsquo;A prudent lad! He never delivered
      himself up to the vanities of dress. No, no!&rsquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;I don&rsquo;t know but I would, though, mind you, if I could do it for
      nothing,&rsquo; said his son, as he resumed the paper.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Ah!&rsquo; chuckled the old man. &lsquo;<i>if</i>, indeed!&mdash;But it&rsquo;s very cold.&rsquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Let the fire be!&rsquo; cried Mr Jonas, stopping his honoured parent&rsquo;s hand in
      the use of the poker. &lsquo;Do you mean to come to want in your old age, that
      you take to wasting now?&rsquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;There&rsquo;s not time for that, Jonas,&rsquo; said the old man.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Not time for what?&rsquo; bawled his heir.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;For me to come to want. I wish there was!&rsquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;You always were as selfish an old blade as need be,&rsquo; said Jonas in a
      voice too low for him to hear, and looking at him with an angry frown.
      &lsquo;You act up to your character. You wouldn&rsquo;t mind coming to want, wouldn&rsquo;t
      you! I dare say you wouldn&rsquo;t. And your own flesh and blood might come to
      want too, might they, for anything you cared? Oh you precious old flint!&rsquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      After this dutiful address he took his tea-cup in his hand&mdash;for that
      meal was in progress, and the father and son and Chuffey were partakers of
      it. Then, looking steadfastly at his father, and stopping now and then to
      carry a spoonful of tea to his lips, he proceeded in the same tone, thus:
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Want, indeed! You&rsquo;re a nice old man to be talking of want at this time of
      day. Beginning to talk of want, are you? Well, I declare! There isn&rsquo;t
      time? No, I should hope not. But you&rsquo;d live to be a couple of hundred if
      you could; and after all be discontented. I know you!&rsquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      The old man sighed, and still sat cowering before the fire. Mr Jonas shook
      his Britannia-metal teaspoon at him, and taking a loftier position, went
      on to argue the point on high moral grounds.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;If you&rsquo;re in such a state of mind as that,&rsquo; he grumbled, but in the same
      subdued key, &lsquo;why don&rsquo;t you make over your property? Buy an annuity cheap,
      and make your life interesting to yourself and everybody else that watches
      the speculation. But no, that wouldn&rsquo;t suit <i>you</i>. That would be natural
      conduct to your own son, and you like to be unnatural, and to keep him out
      of his rights. Why, I should be ashamed of myself if I was you, and glad
      to hide my head in the what you may call it.&rsquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      Possibly this general phrase supplied the place of grave, or tomb, or
      sepulchre, or cemetery, or mausoleum, or other such word which the filial
      tenderness of Mr Jonas made him delicate of pronouncing. He pursued the
      theme no further; for Chuffey, somehow discovering, from his old corner by
      the fireside, that Anthony was in the attitude of a listener, and that
      Jonas appeared to be speaking, suddenly cried out, like one inspired:
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;He is your own son, Mr Chuzzlewit. Your own son, sir!&rsquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      Old Chuffey little suspected what depth of application these words had, or
      that, in the bitter satire which they bore, they might have sunk into the
      old man&rsquo;s very soul, could he have known what words here hanging on his
      own son&rsquo;s lips, or what was passing in his thoughts. But the voice
      diverted the current of Anthony&rsquo;s reflections, and roused him.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Yes, yes, Chuffey, Jonas is a chip of the old block. It is a very old
      block, now, Chuffey,&rsquo; said the old man, with a strange look of
      discomposure.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Precious old,&rsquo; assented Jonas
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;No, no, no,&rsquo; said Chuffey. &lsquo;No, Mr Chuzzlewit. Not old at all, sir.&rsquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Oh! He&rsquo;s worse than ever, you know!&rsquo; cried Jonas, quite disgusted. &lsquo;Upon
      my soul, father, he&rsquo;s getting too bad. Hold your tongue, will you?&rsquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;He says you&rsquo;re wrong!&rsquo; cried Anthony to the old clerk.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Tut, tut!&rsquo; was Chuffey&rsquo;s answer. &lsquo;I know better. I say <i>he&rsquo;s</i> wrong. I say
      <i>he&rsquo;s</i> wrong. He&rsquo;s a boy. That&rsquo;s what he is. So are you, Mr Chuzzlewit&mdash;a
      kind of boy. Ha! ha! ha! You&rsquo;re quite a boy to many I have known; you&rsquo;re a
      boy to me; you&rsquo;re a boy to hundreds of us. Don&rsquo;t mind him!&rsquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      With which extraordinary speech&mdash;for in the case of Chuffey this was
      a burst of eloquence without a parallel&mdash;the poor old shadow drew
      through his palsied arm his master&rsquo;s hand, and held it there, with his own
      folded upon it, as if he would defend him.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;I grow deafer every day, Chuff,&rsquo; said Anthony, with as much softness of
      manner, or, to describe it more correctly, with as little hardness as he
      was capable of expressing.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;No, no,&rsquo; cried Chuffey. &lsquo;No, you don&rsquo;t. What if you did? I&rsquo;ve been deaf
      this twenty year.&rsquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;I grow blinder, too,&rsquo; said the old man, shaking his head.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;That&rsquo;s a good sign!&rsquo; cried Chuffey. &lsquo;Ha! ha! The best sign in the world!
      You saw too well before.&rsquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      He patted Anthony upon the hand as one might comfort a child, and drawing
      the old man&rsquo;s arm still further through his own, shook his trembling
      fingers towards the spot where Jonas sat, as though he would wave him off.
      But, Anthony remaining quite still and silent, he relaxed his hold by slow
      degrees and lapsed into his usual niche in the corner; merely putting
      forth his hand at intervals and touching his old employer gently on the
      coat, as with the design of assuring himself that he was yet beside him.
    </p>
    <p>
      Mr Jonas was so very much amazed by these proceedings that he could do
      nothing but stare at the two old men, until Chuffey had fallen into his
      usual state, and Anthony had sunk into a doze; when he gave some vent to
      his emotions by going close up to the former personage, and making as
      though he would, in vulgar parlance, &lsquo;punch his head.&rsquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;They&rsquo;ve been carrying on this game,&rsquo; thought Jonas in a brown study, &lsquo;for
      the last two or three weeks. I never saw my father take so much notice of
      him as he has in that time. What! You&rsquo;re legacy hunting, are you, Mister
      Chuff? Eh?&rsquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      But Chuffey was as little conscious of the thought as of the bodily
      advance of Mr Jonas&rsquo;s clenched fist, which hovered fondly about his ear.
      When he had scowled at him to his heart&rsquo;s content, Jonas took the candle
      from the table, and walking into the glass office, produced a bunch of
      keys from his pocket. With one of these he opened a secret drawer in the
      desk; peeping stealthily out, as he did so, to be certain that the two old
      men were still before the fire.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;All as right as ever,&rsquo; said Jonas, propping the lid of the desk open with
      his forehead, and unfolding a paper. &lsquo;Here&rsquo;s the will, Mister Chuff.
      Thirty pound a year for your maintenance, old boy, and all the rest to his
      only son, Jonas. You needn&rsquo;t trouble yourself to be too affectionate. You
      won&rsquo;t get anything by it. What&rsquo;s that?&rsquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      It <i>was </i>startling, certainly. A face on the other side of the glass
      partition looking curiously in; and not at him but at the paper in his
      hand. For the eyes were attentively cast down upon the writing, and were
      swiftly raised when he cried out. Then they met his own, and were as the
      eyes of Mr Pecksniff.
    </p>
    <p>
      Suffering the lid of the desk to fall with a loud noise, but not
      forgetting even then to lock it, Jonas, pale and breathless, gazed upon
      this phantom. It moved, opened the door, and walked in.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;What&rsquo;s the matter?&rsquo; cried Jonas, falling back. &lsquo;Who is it? Where do you
      come from? What do you want?&rsquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Matter!&rsquo; cried the voice of Mr Pecksniff, as Pecksniff in the flesh
      smiled amiably upon him. &lsquo;The matter, Mr Jonas!&rsquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;What are you prying and peering about here for?&rsquo; said Jonas, angrily.
      &lsquo;What do you mean by coming up to town in this way, and taking one
      unawares? It&rsquo;s precious odd a man can&rsquo;t read the&mdash;the newspaper&mdash;in
      his own office without being startled out of his wits by people coming in
      without notice. Why didn&rsquo;t you knock at the door?&rsquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;So I did, Mr Jonas,&rsquo; answered Pecksniff, &lsquo;but no one heard me. I was
      curious,&rsquo; he added in his gentle way as he laid his hand upon the young
      man&rsquo;s shoulder, &lsquo;to find out what part of the newspaper interested you so
      much; but the glass was too dim and dirty.&rsquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      Jonas glanced in haste at the partition. Well. It wasn&rsquo;t very clean. So
      far he spoke the truth.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Was it poetry now?&rsquo; said Mr Pecksniff, shaking the forefinger of his
      right hand with an air of cheerful banter. &lsquo;Or was it politics? Or was it
      the price of stock? The main chance, Mr Jonas, the main chance, I
      suspect.&rsquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;You ain&rsquo;t far from the truth,&rsquo; answered Jonas, recovering himself and
      snuffing the candle; &lsquo;but how the deuce do you come to be in London again?
      Ecod! it&rsquo;s enough to make a man stare, to see a fellow looking at him all
      of a sudden, who he thought was sixty or seventy mile away.&rsquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;So it is,&rsquo; said Mr Pecksniff. &lsquo;No doubt of it, my dear Mr Jonas. For
      while the human mind is constituted as it is&mdash;&rsquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Oh, bother the human mind,&rsquo; interrupted Jonas with impatience &lsquo;what have
      you come up for?&rsquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;A little matter of business,&rsquo; said Mr Pecksniff, &lsquo;which has arisen quite
      unexpectedly.&rsquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Oh!&rsquo; cried Jonas, &lsquo;is that all? Well. Here&rsquo;s father in the next room.
      Hallo father, here&rsquo;s Pecksniff! He gets more addle-pated every day he
      lives, I do believe,&rsquo; muttered Jonas, shaking his honoured parent roundly.
      &lsquo;Don&rsquo;t I tell you Pecksniff&rsquo;s here, stupid-head?&rsquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      The combined effects of the shaking and this loving remonstrance soon
      awoke the old man, who gave Mr Pecksniff a chuckling welcome which was
      attributable in part to his being glad to see that gentleman, and in part
      to his unfading delight in the recollection of having called him a
      hypocrite. As Mr Pecksniff had not yet taken tea (indeed he had, but an
      hour before, arrived in London) the remains of the late collation, with a
      rasher of bacon, were served up for his entertainment; and as Mr Jonas had
      a business appointment in the next street, he stepped out to keep it;
      promising to return before Mr Pecksniff could finish his repast.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;And now, my good sir,&rsquo; said Mr Pecksniff to Anthony; &lsquo;now that we are
      alone, pray tell me what I can do for you. I say alone, because I believe
      that our dear friend Mr Chuffey is, metaphysically speaking, a&mdash;shall
      I say a dummy?&rsquo; asked Mr Pecksniff with his sweetest smile, and his head
      very much on one side.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;He neither hears us,&rsquo; replied Anthony, &lsquo;nor sees us.&rsquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Why, then,&rsquo; said Mr Pecksniff, &lsquo;I will be bold to say, with the utmost
      sympathy for his afflictions, and the greatest admiration of those
      excellent qualities which do equal honour to his head and to his heart,
      that he is what is playfully termed a dummy. You were going to observe, my
      dear sir&mdash;?&rsquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;I was not going to make any observation that I know of,&rsquo; replied the old
      man.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;I was,&rsquo; said Mr Pecksniff, mildly.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Oh! <i>you </i>were? What was it?&rsquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;That I never,&rsquo; said Mr Pecksniff, previously rising to see that the door
      was shut, and arranging his chair when he came back, so that it could not
      be opened in the least without his immediately becoming aware of the
      circumstance; &lsquo;that I never in my life was so astonished as by the receipt
      of your letter yesterday. That you should do me the honour to wish to take
      counsel with me on any matter, amazed me; but that you should desire to do
      so, to the exclusion even of Mr Jonas, showed an amount of confidence in
      one to whom you had done a verbal injury&mdash;merely a verbal injury, you
      were anxious to repair&mdash;which gratified, which moved, which overcame
      me.&rsquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      He was always a glib speaker, but he delivered this short address very
      glibly; having been at some pains to compose it outside the coach.
    </p>
    <p>
      Although he paused for a reply, and truly said that he was there at
      Anthony&rsquo;s request, the old man sat gazing at him in profound silence and
      with a perfectly blank face. Nor did he seem to have the least desire or
      impulse to pursue the conversation, though Mr Pecksniff looked towards the
      door, and pulled out his watch, and gave him many other hints that their
      time was short, and Jonas, if he kept his word, would soon return. But the
      strangest incident in all this strange behaviour was, that of a sudden, in
      a moment, so swiftly that it was impossible to trace how, or to observe
      any process of change, his features fell into their old expression, and he
      cried, striking his hand passionately upon the table as if no interval at
      all had taken place:
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Will you hold your tongue, sir, and let me speak?&rsquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      Mr Pecksniff deferred to him with a submissive bow; and said within
      himself, &lsquo;I knew his hand was changed, and that his writing staggered. I
      said so yesterday. Ahem! Dear me!&rsquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Jonas is sweet upon your daughter, Pecksniff,&rsquo; said the old man, in his
      usual tone.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;We spoke of that, if you remember, sir, at Mrs Todgers&rsquo;s,&rsquo; replied the
      courteous architect.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;You needn&rsquo;t speak so loud,&rsquo; retorted Anthony. &lsquo;I&rsquo;m not so deaf as that.&rsquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      Mr Pecksniff had certainly raised his voice pretty high; not so much
      because he thought Anthony was deaf, as because he felt convinced that his
      perceptive faculties were waxing dim; but this quick resentment of his
      considerate behaviour greatly disconcerted him, and, not knowing what tack
      to shape his course upon, he made another inclination of the head, yet
      more submissive that the last.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;I have said,&rsquo; repeated the old man, &lsquo;that Jonas is sweet upon your
      daughter.&rsquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;A charming girl, sir,&rsquo; murmured Mr Pecksniff, seeing that he waited for
      an answer. &lsquo;A dear girl, Mr Chuzzlewit, though I say it, who should not.&rsquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;You know better,&rsquo; cried the old man, advancing his weazen face at least a
      yard, and starting forward in his chair to do it. &lsquo;You lie! What, you <i>will</i>
      be a hypocrite, will you?&rsquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;My good sir,&rsquo; Mr Pecksniff began.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Don&rsquo;t call me a good sir,&rsquo; retorted Anthony, &lsquo;and don&rsquo;t claim to be one
      yourself. If your daughter was what you would have me believe, she
      wouldn&rsquo;t do for Jonas. Being what she is, I think she will. He might be
      deceived in a wife. She might run riot, contract debts, and waste his
      substance. Now when I am dead&mdash;&rsquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      His face altered so horribly as he said the word, that Mr Pecksniff really
      was fain to look another way.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;&mdash;It will be worse for me to know of such doings, than if I was
      alive; for to be tormented for getting that together, which even while I
      suffer for its acquisition, is flung into the very kennels of the streets,
      would be insupportable torture. No,&rsquo; said the old man, hoarsely, &lsquo;let that
      be saved at least; let there be something gained, and kept fast hold of,
      when so much is lost.&rsquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;My dear Mr Chuzzlewit,&rsquo; said Pecksniff, &lsquo;these are unwholesome fancies;
      quite unnecessary, sir, quite uncalled for, I am sure. The truth is, my
      dear sir, that you are not well!&rsquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Not dying though!&rsquo; cried Anthony, with something like the snarl of a wild
      animal. &lsquo;Not yet! There are years of life in me. Why, look at him,&rsquo;
      pointing to his feeble clerk. &lsquo;Death has no right to leave him standing,
      and to mow me down!&rsquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      Mr Pecksniff was so much afraid of the old man, and so completely taken
      aback by the state in which he found him, that he had not even presence of
      mind enough to call up a scrap of morality from the great storehouse
      within his own breast. Therefore he stammered out that no doubt it was, in
      fairness and decency, Mr Chuffey&rsquo;s turn to expire; and that from all he
      had heard of Mr Chuffey, and the little he had the pleasure of knowing of
      that gentleman, personally, he felt convinced in his own mind that he
      would see the propriety of expiring with as little delay as possible.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Come here!&rsquo; said the old man, beckoning him to draw nearer. &lsquo;Jonas will
      be my heir, Jonas will be rich, and a great catch for you. You know that.
      Jonas is sweet upon your daughter.&rsquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;I know that too,&rsquo; thought Mr Pecksniff, &lsquo;for you have said it often
      enough.&rsquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;He might get more money than with her,&rsquo; said the old man, &lsquo;but she will
      help him to take care of what they have. She is not too young or heedless,
      and comes of a good hard griping stock. But don&rsquo;t you play too fine a
      game. She only holds him by a thread; and if you draw it too tight (I know
      his temper) it&rsquo;ll snap. Bind him when he&rsquo;s in the mood, Pecksniff; bind
      him. You&rsquo;re too deep. In your way of leading him on, you&rsquo;ll leave him
      miles behind. Bah, you man of oil, have I no eyes to see how you have
      angled with him from the first?&rsquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Now I wonder,&rsquo; thought Mr Pecksniff, looking at him with a wistful face,
      &lsquo;whether this is all he has to say?&rsquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      Old Anthony rubbed his hands and muttered to himself; complained again
      that he was cold; drew his chair before the fire; and, sitting with his
      back to Mr Pecksniff, and his chin sunk down upon his breast, was, in
      another minute, quite regardless or forgetful of his presence.
    </p>
    <p>
      Uncouth and unsatisfactory as this short interview had been, it had
      furnished Mr Pecksniff with a hint which, supposing nothing further were
      imparted to him, repaid the journey up and home again. For the good
      gentleman had never (for want of an opportunity) dived into the depths of
      Mr Jonas&rsquo;s nature; and any recipe for catching such a son-in-law (much
      more one written on a leaf out of his own father&rsquo;s book) was worth the
      having. In order that he might lose no chance of improving so fair an
      opportunity by allowing Anthony to fall asleep before he had finished all
      he had to say, Mr Pecksniff, in the disposal of the refreshments on the
      table, a work to which he now applied himself in earnest, resorted to many
      ingenious contrivances for attracting his attention; such as coughing,
      sneezing, clattering the teacups, sharpening the knives, dropping the
      loaf, and so forth. But all in vain, for Mr Jonas returned, and Anthony
      had said no more.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;What! My father asleep again?&rsquo; he cried, as he hung up his hat, and cast
      a look at him. &lsquo;Ah! and snoring. Only hear!&rsquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;He snores very deep,&rsquo; said Mr Pecksniff.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Snores deep?&rsquo; repeated Jonas. &lsquo;Yes; let him alone for that. He&rsquo;ll snore
      for six, at any time.&rsquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Do you know, Mr Jonas,&rsquo; said Pecksniff, &lsquo;that I think your father is&mdash;don&rsquo;t
      let me alarm you&mdash;breaking?&rsquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Oh, is he though?&rsquo; replied Jonas, with a shake of the head which
      expressed the closeness of his dutiful observation. &lsquo;Ecod, you don&rsquo;t know
      how tough he is. He ain&rsquo;t upon the move yet.&rsquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;It struck me that he was changed, both in his appearance and manner,&rsquo;
      said Mr Pecksniff.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;That&rsquo;s all you know about it,&rsquo; returned Jonas, seating himself with a
      melancholy air. &lsquo;He never was better than he is now. How are they all at
      home? How&rsquo;s Charity?&rsquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Blooming, Mr Jonas, blooming.&rsquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;And the other one; how&rsquo;s she?&rsquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Volatile trifler!&rsquo; said Mr Pecksniff, fondly musing. &lsquo;She is well, she is
      well. Roving from parlour to bedroom, Mr Jonas, like a bee, skimming from
      post to pillar, like the butterfly; dipping her young beak into our
      currant wine, like the humming-bird! Ah! were she a little less giddy than
      she is; and had she but the sterling qualities of Cherry, my young
      friend!&rsquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Is she so very giddy, then?&rsquo; asked Jonas.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Well, well!&rsquo; said Mr Pecksniff, with great feeling; &lsquo;let me not be hard
      upon my child. Beside her sister Cherry she appears so. A strange noise
      that, Mr Jonas!&rsquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Something wrong in the clock, I suppose,&rsquo; said Jonas, glancing towards
      it. &lsquo;So the other one ain&rsquo;t your favourite, ain&rsquo;t she?&rsquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      The fond father was about to reply, and had already summoned into his face
      a look of most intense sensibility, when the sound he had already noticed
      was repeated.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Upon my word, Mr Jonas, that is a very extraordinary clock,&rsquo; said
      Pecksniff.
    </p>
    <p>
      It would have been, if it had made the noise which startled them; but
      another kind of time-piece was fast running down, and from that the sound
      proceeded. A scream from Chuffey, rendered a hundred times more loud and
      formidable by his silent habits, made the house ring from roof to cellar;
      and, looking round, they saw Anthony Chuzzlewit extended on the floor,
      with the old clerk upon his knees beside him.
    </p>
    <p>
      He had fallen from his chair in a fit, and lay there, battling for each
      gasp of breath, with every shrivelled vein and sinew starting in its
      place, as if it were bent on bearing witness to his age, and sternly
      pleading with Nature against his recovery. It was frightful to see how the
      principle of life, shut up within his withered frame, fought like a strong
      devil, mad to be released, and rent its ancient prison-house. A young man
      in the fullness of his vigour, struggling with so much strength of
      desperation, would have been a dismal sight; but an old, old, shrunken
      body, endowed with preternatural might, and giving the lie in every motion
      of its every limb and joint to its enfeebled aspect, was a hideous
      spectacle indeed.

    <p>
      They raised him up, and fetched a surgeon with all haste, who bled the
      patient and applied some remedies; but the fits held him so long that it
      was past midnight when they got him&mdash;quiet now, but quite unconscious
      and exhausted&mdash;into bed.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Don&rsquo;t go,&rsquo; said Jonas, putting his ashy lips to Mr Pecksniff&rsquo;s ear and
      whispered across the bed. &lsquo;It was a mercy you were present when he was
      taken ill. Some one might have said it was my doing.&rsquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;<i>your </i>doing!&rsquo; cried Mr Pecksniff.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;I don&rsquo;t know but they might,&rsquo; he replied, wiping the moisture from his
      white face. &lsquo;People say such things. How does he look now?&rsquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      Mr Pecksniff shook his head.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;I used to joke, you know,&rsquo; said. Jonas: &lsquo;but I&mdash;I never wished him
      dead. Do you think he&rsquo;s very bad?&rsquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;The doctor said he was. You heard,&rsquo; was Mr Pecksniff&rsquo;s answer.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Ah! but he might say that to charge us more, in case of his getting well&rsquo;
      said Jonas. &lsquo;You mustn&rsquo;t go away, Pecksniff. Now it&rsquo;s come to this, I
      wouldn&rsquo;t be without a witness for a thousand pound.&rsquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      Chuffey said not a word, and heard not a word. He had sat himself down in
      a chair at the bedside, and there he remained, motionless; except that he
      sometimes bent his head over the pillow, and seemed to listen. He never
      changed in this. Though once in the dreary night Mr Pecksniff, having
      dozed, awoke with a confused impression that he had heard him praying, and
      strangely mingling figures&mdash;not of speech, but arithmetic&mdash;with
      his broken prayers.
    </p>
    <p>
      Jonas sat there, too, all night; not where his father could have seen him,
      had his consciousness returned, but hiding, as it were, behind him, and
      only reading how he looked, in Mr Pecksniff&rsquo;s eyes. <i>He</i>, the coarse
      upstart, who had ruled the house so long&mdash;that craven cur, who was
      afraid to move, and shook so, that his very shadow fluttered on the wall!
      It was broad, bright, stirring day when, leaving the old clerk to watch
      him, they went down to breakfast. People hurried up and down the street;
      windows and doors were opened; thieves and beggars took their usual posts;
      workmen bestirred themselves; tradesmen set forth their shops; bailiffs
      and constables were on the watch; all kinds of human creatures strove, in
      their several ways, as hard to live, as the one sick old man who combated
      for every grain of sand in his fast-emptying glass, as eagerly as if it
      were an empire.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;If anything happens Pecksniff,&rsquo; said Jonas, &lsquo;you must promise me to stop
      here till it&rsquo;s all over. You shall see that I do what&rsquo;s right.&rsquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;I know that you will do what&rsquo;s right, Mr Jonas,&rsquo; said Pecksniff.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Yes, yes, but I won&rsquo;t be doubted. No one shall have it in his power to
      say a syllable against me,&rsquo; he returned. &lsquo;I know how people will talk.
      Just as if he wasn&rsquo;t old, or I had the secret of keeping him alive!&rsquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      Mr Pecksniff promised that he would remain, if circumstances should render
      it, in his esteemed friend&rsquo;s opinion, desirable; they were finishing their
      meal in silence, when suddenly an apparition stood before them, so ghastly
      to the view that Jonas shrieked aloud, and both recoiled in horror.
    </p>
    <p>
      Old Anthony, dressed in his usual clothes, was in the room&mdash;beside
      the table. He leaned upon the shoulder of his solitary friend; and on his
      livid face, and on his horny hands, and in his glassy eyes, and traced by
      an eternal finger in the very drops of sweat upon his brow, was one word&mdash;Death.
    </p>
    <p>
      He spoke to them&mdash;in something of his own voice too, but sharpened
      and made hollow, like a dead man&rsquo;s face. What he would have said, God
      knows. He seemed to utter words, but they were such as man had never
      heard. And this was the most fearful circumstance of all, to see him
      standing there, gabbling in an unearthly tongue.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;He&rsquo;s better now,&rsquo; said Chuffey. &lsquo;Better now. Let him sit in his old
      chair, and he&rsquo;ll be well again. I told him not to mind. I said so,
      yesterday.&rsquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      They put him in his easy-chair, and wheeled it near the window; then,
      swinging open the door, exposed him to the free current of morning air.
      But not all the air that is, nor all the winds that ever blew &lsquo;twixt
      Heaven and Earth, could have brought new life to him.
    </p>
    <p>
      Plunge him to the throat in golden pieces now, and his heavy fingers shall
      not close on one!

      CHAPTER NINETEEN
    </h2>
    <p>
      THE READER IS BROUGHT INTO COMMUNICATION WITH SOME PROFESSIONAL PERSONS,
      AND SHEDS A TEAR OVER THE FILIAL PIETY OF GOOD MR JONAS
    </p>
    <p>
      Mr Pecksniff was in a hackney cabriolet, for Jonas Chuzzlewit had said
      &lsquo;Spare no expense.&rsquo; Mankind is evil in its thoughts and in its base
      constructions, and Jonas was resolved it should not have an inch to
      stretch into an ell against him. It never should be charged upon his
      father&rsquo;s son that he had grudged the money for his father&rsquo;s funeral.
      Hence, until the obsequies should be concluded, Jonas had taken for his
      motto &lsquo;Spend, and spare not!&rsquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      Mr Pecksniff had been to the undertaker, and was now upon his way to
      another officer in the train of mourning&mdash;a female functionary, a
      nurse, and watcher, and performer of nameless offices about the persons of
      the dead&mdash;whom he had recommended. Her name, as Mr Pecksniff gathered
      from a scrap of writing in his hand, was Gamp; her residence in Kingsgate
      Street, High Holborn. So Mr Pecksniff, in a hackney cab, was rattling over
      Holborn stones, in quest of Mrs Gamp.
    </p>
    <p>
      This lady lodged at a bird-fancier&rsquo;s, next door but one to the celebrated
      mutton-pie shop, and directly opposite to the original cat&rsquo;s-meat
      warehouse; the renown of which establishments was duly heralded on their
      respective fronts. It was a little house, and this was the more
      convenient; for Mrs Gamp being, in her highest walk of art, a monthly
      nurse, or, as her sign-board boldly had it, &lsquo;Midwife,&rsquo; and lodging in the
      first-floor front, was easily assailable at night by pebbles,
      walking-sticks, and fragments of tobacco-pipe; all much more efficacious
      than the street-door knocker, which was so constructed as to wake the
      street with ease, and even spread alarms of fire in Holborn, without
      making the smallest impression on the premises to which it was addressed.
    </p>
    <p>
      It chanced on this particular occasion, that Mrs Gamp had been up all the
      previous night, in attendance upon a ceremony to which the usage of
      gossips has given that name which expresses, in two syllables, the curse
      pronounced on Adam. It chanced that Mrs Gamp had not been regularly
      engaged, but had been called in at a crisis, in consequence of her great
      repute, to assist another professional lady with her advice; and thus it
      happened that, all points of interest in the case being over, Mrs Gamp had
      come home again to the bird-fancier&rsquo;s and gone to bed. So when Mr
      Pecksniff drove up in the hackney cab, Mrs Gamp&rsquo;s curtains were drawn
      close, and Mrs Gamp was fast asleep behind them.
    </p>
    <p>
      If the bird-fancier had been at home, as he ought to have been, there
      would have been no great harm in this; but he was out, and his shop was
      closed. The shutters were down certainly; and in every pane of glass there
      was at least one tiny bird in a tiny bird-cage, twittering and hopping his
      little ballet of despair, and knocking his head against the roof; while
      one unhappy goldfinch who lived outside a red villa with his name on the
      door, drew the water for his own drinking, and mutely appealed to some
      good man to drop a farthing&rsquo;s-worth of poison in it. Still, the door was
      shut. Mr Pecksniff tried the latch, and shook it, causing a cracked bell
      inside to ring most mournfully; but no one came. The bird-fancier was an
      easy shaver also, and a fashionable hair-dresser also, and perhaps he had
      been sent for, express, from the court end of the town, to trim a lord, or
      cut and curl a lady; but however that might be, there, upon his own
      ground, he was not; nor was there any more distinct trace of him to assist
      the imagination of an inquirer, than a professional print or emblem of his
      calling (much favoured in the trade), representing a hair-dresser of easy
      manners curling a lady of distinguished fashion, in the presence of a
      patent upright grand pianoforte.
    </p>
    <p>
      Noting these circumstances, Mr Pecksniff, in the innocence of his heart,
      applied himself to the knocker; but at the first double knock every window
      in the street became alive with female heads; and before he could repeat
      the performance whole troops of married ladies (some about to trouble Mrs
      Gamp themselves very shortly) came flocking round the steps, all crying
      out with one accord, and with uncommon interest, &lsquo;Knock at the winder,
      sir, knock at the winder. Lord bless you, don&rsquo;t lose no more time than you
      can help&mdash;knock at the winder!&rsquo;
    </p>
<div class="fig" style="width:65%">
      <img src="images/20342m.jpg" alt="20342m " width="100%" /><br />
    </div>
    <h5>
      <a href="images/20342.jpg"><i>Original</i></a>
    </h5>
    <p>
      Acting upon this suggestion, and borrowing the driver&rsquo;s whip for the
      purpose, Mr Pecksniff soon made a commotion among the first floor
      flower-pots, and roused Mrs Gamp, whose voice&mdash;to the great
      satisfaction of the matrons&mdash;was heard to say, &lsquo;I&rsquo;m coming.&rsquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;He&rsquo;s as pale as a muffin,&rsquo; said one lady, in allusion to Mr Pecksniff.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;So he ought to be, if he&rsquo;s the feelings of a man,&rsquo; observed another.
    </p>
    <p>
      A third lady (with her arms folded) said she wished he had chosen any
      other time for fetching Mrs Gamp, but it always happened so with <i>her</i>.
    </p>
    <p>
      It gave Mr Pecksniff much uneasiness to find, from these remarks, that he
      was supposed to have come to Mrs Gamp upon an errand touching&mdash;not
      the close of life, but the other end. Mrs Gamp herself was under the same
      impression, for, throwing open the window, she cried behind the curtains,
      as she hastily attired herself&mdash;
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Is it Mrs Perkins?&rsquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;No!&rsquo; returned Mr Pecksniff, sharply. &lsquo;Nothing of the sort.&rsquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;What, Mr Whilks!&rsquo; cried Mrs Gamp. &lsquo;Don&rsquo;t say it&rsquo;s you, Mr Whilks, and
      that poor creetur Mrs Whilks with not even a pincushion ready. Don&rsquo;t say
      it&rsquo;s you, Mr Whilks!&rsquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;It isn&rsquo;t Mr Whilks,&rsquo; said Pecksniff. &lsquo;I don&rsquo;t know the man. Nothing of
      the kind. A gentleman is dead; and some person being wanted in the house,
      you have been recommended by Mr Mould the undertaker.&rsquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      As she was by this time in a condition to appear, Mrs Gamp, who had a face
      for all occasions, looked out of the window with her mourning countenance,
      and said she would be down directly. But the matrons took it very ill that
      Mr Pecksniff&rsquo;s mission was of so unimportant a kind; and the lady with her
      arms folded rated him in good round terms, signifying that she would be
      glad to know what he meant by terrifying delicate females &lsquo;with his
      corpses;&rsquo; and giving it as her opinion that he was quite ugly enough to
      know better. The other ladies were not at all behind-hand in expressing
      similar sentiments; and the children, of whom some scores had now
      collected, hooted and defied Mr Pecksniff quite savagely. So when Mrs Gamp
      appeared, the unoffending gentleman was glad to hustle her with very
      little ceremony into the cabriolet, and drive off, overwhelmed with
      popular execration.
    </p>
    <p>
      Mrs Gamp had a large bundle with her, a pair of pattens, and a species of
      gig umbrella; the latter article in colour like a faded leaf, except where
      a circular patch of a lively blue had been dexterously let in at the top.
      She was much flurried by the haste she had made, and laboured under the
      most erroneous views of cabriolets, which she appeared to confound with
      mail-coaches or stage-wagons, inasmuch as she was constantly endeavouring
      for the first half mile to force her luggage through the little front
      window, and clamouring to the driver to &lsquo;put it in the boot.&rsquo; When she was
      disabused of this idea, her whole being resolved itself into an absorbing
      anxiety about her pattens, with which she played innumerable games at
      quoits on Mr Pecksniff&rsquo;s legs. It was not until they were close upon the
      house of mourning that she had enough composure to observe&mdash;
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;And so the gentleman&rsquo;s dead, sir! Ah! The more&rsquo;s the pity.&rsquo; She didn&rsquo;t
      even know his name. &lsquo;But it&rsquo;s what we must all come to. It&rsquo;s as certain as
      being born, except that we can&rsquo;t make our calculations as exact. Ah! Poor
      dear!&rsquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      She was a fat old woman, this Mrs Gamp, with a husky voice and a moist
      eye, which she had a remarkable power of turning up, and only showing the
      white of it. Having very little neck, it cost her some trouble to look
      over herself, if one may say so, at those to whom she talked. She wore a
      very rusty black gown, rather the worse for snuff, and a shawl and bonnet
      to correspond. In these dilapidated articles of dress she had, on
      principle, arrayed herself, time out of mind, on such occasions as the
      present; for this at once expressed a decent amount of veneration for the
      deceased, and invited the next of kin to present her with a fresher suit
      of weeds; an appeal so frequently successful, that the very fetch and
      ghost of Mrs Gamp, bonnet and all, might be seen hanging up, any hour in
      the day, in at least a dozen of the second-hand clothes shops about
      Holborn. The face of Mrs Gamp&mdash;the nose in particular&mdash;was
      somewhat red and swollen, and it was difficult to enjoy her society
      without becoming conscious of a smell of spirits. Like most persons who
      have attained to great eminence in their profession, she took to hers very
      kindly; insomuch that, setting aside her natural predilections as a woman,
      she went to a lying-in or a laying-out with equal zest and relish.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Ah!&rsquo; repeated Mrs Gamp; for it was always a safe sentiment in cases of
      mourning. &lsquo;Ah dear! When Gamp was summoned to his long home, and I see him
      a-lying in Guy&rsquo;s Hospital with a penny-piece on each eye, and his wooden
      leg under his left arm, I thought I should have fainted away. But I bore
      up.&rsquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      If certain whispers current in the Kingsgate Street circles had any truth
      in them, she had indeed borne up surprisingly; and had exerted such
      uncommon fortitude as to dispose of Mr Gamp&rsquo;s remains for the benefit of
      science. But it should be added, in fairness, that this had happened
      twenty years before; and that Mr and Mrs Gamp had long been separated on
      the ground of incompatibility of temper in their drink.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;You have become indifferent since then, I suppose?&rsquo; said Mr Pecksniff.
      &lsquo;Use is second nature, Mrs Gamp.&rsquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;You may well say second nater, sir,&rsquo; returned that lady. &lsquo;One&rsquo;s first
      ways is to find sich things a trial to the feelings, and so is one&rsquo;s
      lasting custom. If it wasn&rsquo;t for the nerve a little sip of liquor gives me
      (I never was able to do more than taste it), I never could go through with
      what I sometimes has to do. &ldquo;Mrs Harris,&rdquo; I says, at the very last case as
      ever I acted in, which it was but a young person, &ldquo;Mrs Harris,&rdquo; I says,
      &ldquo;leave the bottle on the chimley-piece, and don&rsquo;t ask me to take none, but
      let me put my lips to it when I am so dispoged, and then I will do what
      I&rsquo;m engaged to do, according to the best of my ability.&rdquo; &ldquo;Mrs Gamp,&rdquo; she
      says, in answer, &ldquo;if ever there was a sober creetur to be got at eighteen
      pence a day for working people, and three and six for gentlefolks&mdash;night
      watching,&rdquo;&rsquo; said Mrs Gamp with emphasis, &lsquo;&ldquo;being a extra charge&mdash;you
      are that inwallable person.&rdquo; &ldquo;Mrs Harris,&rdquo; I says to her, &ldquo;don&rsquo;t name the
      charge, for if I could afford to lay all my feller creeturs out for
      nothink, I would gladly do it, sich is the love I bears &lsquo;em. But what I
      always says to them as has the management of matters, Mrs Harris&rdquo;&rsquo;&mdash;here
      she kept her eye on Mr Pecksniff&mdash;&lsquo;"be they gents or be they ladies,
      is, don&rsquo;t ask me whether I won&rsquo;t take none, or whether I will, but leave
      the bottle on the chimley-piece, and let me put my lips to it when I am so
      dispoged.&rdquo;&rsquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      The conclusion of this affecting narrative brought them to the house. In
      the passage they encountered Mr Mould the undertaker; a little elderly
      gentleman, bald, and in a suit of black; with a notebook in his hand, a
      massive gold watch-chain dangling from his fob, and a face in which a
      queer attempt at melancholy was at odds with a smirk of satisfaction; so
      that he looked as a man might, who, in the very act of smacking his lips
      over choice old wine, tried to make believe it was physic.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Well, Mrs Gamp, and how are <i>you</i>, Mrs Gamp?&rsquo; said this gentleman, in a
      voice as soft as his step.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Pretty well, I thank you, sir,&rsquo; dropping a curtsey.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;You&rsquo;ll be very particular here, Mrs Gamp. This is not a common case, Mrs
      Gamp. Let everything be very nice and comfortable, Mrs Gamp, if you
      please,&rsquo; said the undertaker, shaking his head with a solemn air.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;It shall be, sir,&rsquo; she replied, curtseying again. &lsquo;You knows me of old,
      sir, I hope.&rsquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;I hope so, too, Mrs Gamp,&rsquo; said the undertaker, &lsquo;and I think so also.&rsquo;
      Mrs Gamp curtseyed again. &lsquo;This is one of the most impressive cases, sir,&rsquo;
      he continued, addressing Mr Pecksniff, &lsquo;that I have seen in the whole
      course of my professional experience.&rsquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Indeed, Mr Mould!&rsquo; cried that gentleman.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Such affectionate regret, sir, I never saw. There is no limitation, there
      is positively <i>no</i> limitation&rsquo;&mdash;opening his eyes wide, and standing on
      tiptoe&mdash;&lsquo;in point of expense! I have orders, sir, to put on my whole
      establishment of mutes; and mutes come very dear, Mr Pecksniff; not to
      mention their drink. To provide silver-plated handles of the very best
      description, ornamented with angels&rsquo; heads from the most expensive dies.
      To be perfectly profuse in feathers. In short, sir, to turn out something
      absolutely gorgeous.&rsquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;My friend Mr Jonas is an excellent man,&rsquo; said Mr Pecksniff.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;I have seen a good deal of what is filial in my time, sir,&rsquo; retorted
      Mould, &lsquo;and what is unfilial too. It is our lot. We come into the
      knowledge of those secrets. But anything so filial as this; anything so
      honourable to human nature; so calculated to reconcile all of us to the
      world we live in; never yet came under my observation. It only proves,
      sir, what was so forcibly observed by the lamented theatrical poet&mdash;buried
      at Stratford&mdash;that there is good in everything.&rsquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;It is very pleasant to hear you say so, Mr Mould,&rsquo; observed Pecksniff.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;You are very kind, sir. And what a man Mr Chuzzlewit was, sir! Ah! what a
      man he was. You may talk of your lord mayors,&rsquo; said Mould, waving his hand
      at the public in general, &lsquo;your sheriffs, your common councilmen, your
      trumpery; but show me a man in this city who is worthy to walk in the
      shoes of the departed Mr Chuzzlewit. No, no,&rsquo; cried Mould, with bitter
      sarcasm. &lsquo;Hang &lsquo;em up, hang &lsquo;em up; sole &lsquo;em and heel &lsquo;em, and have &lsquo;em
      ready for his son against he&rsquo;s old enough to wear &lsquo;em; but don&rsquo;t try &lsquo;em
      on yourselves, for they won&rsquo;t fit you. We knew him,&rsquo; said Mould, in the
      same biting vein, as he pocketed his note-book; &lsquo;we knew him, and are not
      to be caught with chaff. Mr Pecksniff, sir, good morning.&rsquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      Mr Pecksniff returned the compliment; and Mould, sensible of having
      distinguished himself, was going away with a brisk smile, when he
      fortunately remembered the occasion. Quickly becoming depressed again, he
      sighed; looked into the crown of his hat, as if for comfort; put it on
      without finding any; and slowly departed.
    </p>
    <p>
      Mrs Gamp and Mr Pecksniff then ascended the staircase; and the former,
      having been shown to the chamber in which all that remained of Anthony
      Chuzzlewit lay covered up, with but one loving heart, and that a halting
      one, to mourn it, left the latter free to enter the darkened room below,
      and rejoin Mr Jonas, from whom he had now been absent nearly two hours.
    </p>
    <p>
      He found that example to bereaved sons, and pattern in the eyes of all
      performers of funerals, musing over a fragment of writing-paper on the
      desk, and scratching figures on it with a pen. The old man&rsquo;s chair, and
      hat, and walking-stick, were removed from their accustomed places, and put
      out of sight; the window-blinds as yellow as November fogs, were drawn
      down close; Jonas himself was so subdued, that he could scarcely be heard
      to speak, and only seen to walk across the room.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Pecksniff,&rsquo; he said, in a whisper, &lsquo;you shall have the regulation of it
      all, mind! You shall be able to tell anybody who talks about it that
      everything was correctly and nicely done. There isn&rsquo;t any one you&rsquo;d like
      to ask to the funeral, is there?&rsquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;No, Mr Jonas, I think not.&rsquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Because if there is, you know,&rsquo; said Jonas, &lsquo;ask him. We don&rsquo;t want to
      make a secret of it.&rsquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;No,&rsquo; repeated Mr Pecksniff, after a little reflection. &lsquo;I am not the less
      obliged to you on that account, Mr Jonas, for your liberal hospitality;
      but there really is no one.&rsquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Very well,&rsquo; said Jonas; &lsquo;then you, and I, and Chuffey, and the doctor,
      will be just a coachful. We&rsquo;ll have the doctor, Pecksniff, because he
      knows what was the matter with him, and that it couldn&rsquo;t be helped.&rsquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Where is our dear friend, Mr Chuffey?&rsquo; asked Pecksniff, looking round the
      chamber, and winking both his eyes at once&mdash;for he was overcome by
      his feelings.
    </p>
    <p>
      But here he was interrupted by Mrs Gamp, who, divested of her bonnet and
      shawl, came sidling and bridling into the room; and with some sharpness
      demanded a conference outside the door with Mr Pecksniff.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;You may say whatever you wish to say here, Mrs Gamp,&rsquo; said that
      gentleman, shaking his head with a melancholy expression.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;It is not much as I have to say when people is a-mourning for the dead
      and gone,&rsquo; said Mrs Gamp; &lsquo;but what I have to say is <i>to</i> the pint and
      purpose, and no offence intended, must be so considered. I have been at a
      many places in my time, gentlemen, and I hope I knows what my duties is,
      and how the same should be performed; in course, if I did not, it would be
      very strange, and very wrong in sich a gentleman as Mr Mould, which has
      undertook the highest families in this land, and given every satisfaction,
      so to recommend me as he does. I have seen a deal of trouble my own self,&rsquo;
      said Mrs Gamp, laying greater and greater stress upon her words, &lsquo;and I
      can feel for them as has their feelings tried, but I am not a Rooshan or a
      Prooshan, and consequently cannot suffer Spies to be set over me.&rsquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      Before it was possible that an answer could be returned, Mrs Gamp, growing
      redder in the face, went on to say:
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;It is not a easy matter, gentlemen, to live when you are left a widder
      woman; particular when your feelings works upon you to that extent that
      you often find yourself a-going out on terms which is a certain loss, and
      never can repay. But in whatever way you earns your bread, you may have
      rules and regulations of your own which cannot be broke through. Some
      people,&rsquo; said Mrs Gamp, again entrenching herself behind her strong point,
      as if it were not assailable by human ingenuity, &lsquo;may be Rooshans, and
      others may be Prooshans; they are born so, and will please themselves.
      Them which is of other naturs thinks different.&rsquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;If I understand this good lady,&rsquo; said Mr Pecksniff, turning to Jonas, &lsquo;Mr
      Chuffey is troublesome to her. Shall I fetch him down?&rsquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Do,&rsquo; said Jonas. &lsquo;I was going to tell you he was up there, when she came
      in. I&rsquo;d go myself and bring him down, only&mdash;only I&rsquo;d rather you went,
      if you don&rsquo;t mind.&rsquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      Mr Pecksniff promptly departed, followed by Mrs Gamp, who, seeing that he
      took a bottle and glass from the cupboard, and carried it in his hand, was
      much softened.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;I am sure,&rsquo; she said, &lsquo;that if it wasn&rsquo;t for his own happiness, I should
      no more mind him being there, poor dear, than if he was a fly. But them as
      isn&rsquo;t used to these things, thinks so much of &lsquo;em afterwards, that it&rsquo;s a
      kindness to &lsquo;em not to let &lsquo;em have their wish. And even,&rsquo; said Mrs Gamp,
      probably in reference to some flowers of speech she had already strewn on
      Mr Chuffey, &lsquo;even if one calls &lsquo;em names, it&rsquo;s only done to rouse &lsquo;em.&rsquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      Whatever epithets she had bestowed on the old clerk, they had not roused
      <i>him</i>. He sat beside the bed, in the chair he had occupied all the previous
      night, with his hands folded before him, and his head bowed down; and
      neither looked up, on their entrance, nor gave any sign of consciousness,
      until Mr Pecksniff took him by the arm, when he meekly rose.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Three score and ten,&rsquo; said Chuffey, &lsquo;ought and carry seven. Some men are
      so strong that they live to four score&mdash;four times ought&rsquo;s an ought,
      four times two&rsquo;s an eight&mdash;eighty. Oh! why&mdash;why&mdash;why didn&rsquo;t
      he live to four times ought&rsquo;s an ought, and four times two&rsquo;s an eight,
      eighty?&rsquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Ah! what a wale of grief!&rsquo; cried Mrs Gamp, possessing herself of the
      bottle and glass.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Why did he die before his poor old crazy servant?&rsquo; said Chuffey, clasping
      his hands and looking up in anguish. &lsquo;Take him from me, and what remains?&rsquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Mr Jonas,&rsquo; returned Pecksniff, &lsquo;Mr Jonas, my good friend.&rsquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;I loved him,&rsquo; cried the old man, weeping. &lsquo;He was good to me. We learnt
      Tare and Tret together at school. I took him down once, six boys in the
      arithmetic class. God forgive me! Had I the heart to take him down!&rsquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Come, Mr Chuffey,&rsquo; said Pecksniff. &lsquo;Come with me. Summon up your
      fortitude, Mr Chuffey.&rsquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Yes, I will,&rsquo; returned the old clerk. &lsquo;Yes. I&rsquo;ll sum up my forty&mdash;How
      many times forty&mdash;Oh, Chuzzlewit and Son&mdash;Your own son Mr
      Chuzzlewit; your own son, sir!&rsquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      He yielded to the hand that guided him, as he lapsed into this familiar
      expression, and submitted to be led away. Mrs Gamp, with the bottle on one
      knee, and the glass on the other, sat upon a stool, shaking her head for a
      long time, until, in a moment of abstraction, she poured out a dram of
      spirits, and raised it to her lips. It was succeeded by a second, and by a
      third, and then her eyes&mdash;either in the sadness of her reflections
      upon life and death, or in her admiration of the liquor&mdash;were so
      turned up, as to be quite invisible. But she shook her head still.
    </p>
    <p>
      Poor Chuffey was conducted to his accustomed corner, and there he
      remained, silent and quiet, save at long intervals, when he would rise,
      and walk about the room, and wring his hands, or raise some strange and
      sudden cry. For a whole week they all three sat about the hearth and never
      stirred abroad. Mr Pecksniff would have walked out in the evening time,
      but Mr Jonas was so averse to his being absent for a minute, that he
      abandoned the idea, and so, from morning until night, they brooded
      together in the dark room, without relief or occupation.
    </p>
    <p>
      The weight of that which was stretched out, stiff and stark, in the awful
      chamber above-stairs, so crushed and bore down Jonas, that he bent beneath
      the load. During the whole long seven days and nights, he was always
      oppressed and haunted by a dreadful sense of its presence in the house.
      Did the door move, he looked towards it with a livid face and starting
      eye, as if he fully believed that ghostly fingers clutched the handle. Did
      the fire flicker in a draught of air, he glanced over his shoulder, as
      almost dreading to behold some shrouded figure fanning and flapping at it
      with its fearful dress. The lightest noise disturbed him; and once, in the
      night, at the sound of a footstep overhead, he cried out that the dead man
      was walking&mdash;tramp, tramp, tramp&mdash;about his coffin.
    </p>
    <p>
      He lay at night upon a mattress on the floor of the sitting-room; his own
      chamber having been assigned to Mrs Gamp; and Mr Pecksniff was similarly
      accommodated. The howling of a dog before the house, filled him with a
      terror he could not disguise. He avoided the reflection in the opposite
      windows of the light that burned above, as though it had been an angry
      eye. He often, in every night, rose up from his fitful sleep, and looked
      and longed for dawn; all directions and arrangements, even to the ordering
      of their daily meals, he abandoned to Mr Pecksniff. That excellent
      gentleman, deeming that the mourner wanted comfort, and that high feeding
      was likely to do him infinite service, availed himself of these
      opportunities to such good purpose, that they kept quite a dainty table
      during this melancholy season; with sweetbreads, stewed kidneys, oysters,
      and other such light viands for supper every night; over which, and sundry
      jorums of hot punch, Mr Pecksniff delivered such moral reflections and
      spiritual consolation as might have converted a Heathen&mdash;especially
      if he had had but an imperfect acquaintance with the English tongue.
    </p>
    <p>
      Nor did Mr Pecksniff alone indulge in the creature comforts during this
      sad time. Mrs Gamp proved to be very choice in her eating, and repudiated
      hashed mutton with scorn. In her drinking too, she was very punctual and
      particular, requiring a pint of mild porter at lunch, a pint at dinner,
      half-a-pint as a species of stay or holdfast between dinner and tea, and a
      pint of the celebrated staggering ale, or Real Old Brighton Tipper, at
      supper; besides the bottle on the chimney-piece, and such casual
      invitations to refresh herself with wine as the good breeding of her
      employers might prompt them to offer. In like manner, Mr Mould&rsquo;s men found
      it necessary to drown their grief, like a young kitten in the morning of
      its existence, for which reason they generally fuddled themselves before
      they began to do anything, lest it should make head and get the better of
      them. In short, the whole of that strange week was a round of dismal
      joviality and grim enjoyment; and every one, except poor Chuffey, who came
      within the shadow of Anthony Chuzzlewit&rsquo;s grave, feasted like a Ghoul.
    </p>
    <p>
      At length the day of the funeral, pious and truthful ceremony that it was,
      arrived. Mr Mould, with a glass of generous port between his eye and the
      light, leaned against the desk in the little glass office with his gold
      watch in his unoccupied hand, and conversed with Mrs Gamp; two mutes were
      at the house-door, looking as mournful as could be reasonably expected of
      men with such a thriving job in hand; the whole of Mr Mould&rsquo;s
      establishment were on duty within the house or without; feathers waved,
      horses snorted, silk and velvets fluttered; in a word, as Mr Mould
      emphatically said, &lsquo;Everything that money could do was done.&rsquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;And what can do more, Mrs Gamp?&rsquo; exclaimed the undertaker as he emptied
      his glass and smacked his lips.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Nothing in the world, sir.&rsquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Nothing in the world,&rsquo; repeated Mr Mould. &lsquo;You are right, Mrs Gamp. Why
      do people spend more money&rsquo;&mdash;here he filled his glass again&mdash;&lsquo;upon
      a death, Mrs Gamp, than upon a birth? Come, that&rsquo;s in your way; you ought
      to know. How do you account for that now?&rsquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Perhaps it is because an undertaker&rsquo;s charges comes dearer than a nurse&rsquo;s
      charges, sir,&rsquo; said Mrs Gamp, tittering, and smoothing down her new black
      dress with her hands.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Ha, ha!&rsquo; laughed Mr Mould. &lsquo;You have been breakfasting at somebody&rsquo;s
      expense this morning, Mrs Gamp.&rsquo; But seeing, by the aid of a little
      shaving-glass which hung opposite, that he looked merry, he composed his
      features and became sorrowful.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Many&rsquo;s the time that I&rsquo;ve not breakfasted at my own expense along of your
      recommending, sir; and many&rsquo;s the time I hope to do the same in time to
      come,&rsquo; said Mrs Gamp, with an apologetic curtsey.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;So be it,&rsquo; replied Mr Mould, &lsquo;please Providence. No, Mrs Gamp; I&rsquo;ll tell
      you why it is. It&rsquo;s because the laying out of money with a well-conducted
      establishment, where the thing is performed upon the very best scale,
      binds the broken heart, and sheds balm upon the wounded spirit. Hearts
      want binding, and spirits want balming when people die; not when people
      are born. Look at this gentleman to-day; look at him.&rsquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;An open-handed gentleman?&rsquo; cried Mrs Gamp, with enthusiasm.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;No, no,&rsquo; said the undertaker; &lsquo;not an open-handed gentleman in general,
      by any means. There you mistake him; but an afflicted gentleman, an
      affectionate gentleman, who knows what it is in the power of money to do,
      in giving him relief, and in testifying his love and veneration for the
      departed. It can give him,&rsquo; said Mr Mould, waving his watch-chain slowly
      round and round, so that he described one circle after every item; &lsquo;it can
      give him four horses to each vehicle; it can give him velvet trappings; it
      can give him drivers in cloth cloaks and top-boots; it can give him the
      plumage of the ostrich, dyed black; it can give him any number of walking
      attendants, dressed in the first style of funeral fashion, and carrying
      batons tipped with brass; it can give him a handsome tomb; it can give him
      a place in Westminster Abbey itself, if he choose to invest it in such a
      purchase. Oh! do not let us say that gold is dross, when it can buy such
      things as these, Mrs Gamp.&rsquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;But what a blessing, sir,&rsquo; said Mrs Gamp, &lsquo;that there are such as you, to
      sell or let &lsquo;em out on hire!&rsquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Aye, Mrs Gamp, you are right,&rsquo; rejoined the undertaker. &lsquo;We should be an
      honoured calling. We do good by stealth, and blush to have it mentioned in
      our little bills. How much consolation may I&mdash;even I,&rsquo; cried Mr
      Mould, &lsquo;have diffused among my fellow-creatures by means of my four
      long-tailed prancers, never harnessed under ten pund ten!&rsquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      Mrs Gamp had begun to make a suitable reply, when she was interrupted by
      the appearance of one of Mr Mould&rsquo;s assistants&mdash;his chief mourner in
      fact&mdash;an obese person, with his waistcoat in closer connection with
      his legs than is quite reconcilable with the established ideas of grace;
      with that cast of feature which is figuratively called a bottle nose; and
      with a face covered all over with pimples. He had been a tender plant once
      upon a time, but from constant blowing in the fat atmosphere of funerals,
      had run to seed.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Well, Tacker,&rsquo; said Mr Mould, &lsquo;is all ready below?&rsquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;A beautiful show, sir,&rsquo; rejoined Tacker. &lsquo;The horses are prouder and
      fresher than ever I see &lsquo;em; and toss their heads, they do, as if they
      knowed how much their plumes cost. One, two, three, four,&rsquo; said Mr Tacker,
      heaping that number of black cloaks upon his left arm.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Is Tom there, with the cake and wine?&rsquo; asked Mr Mould.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Ready to come in at a moment&rsquo;s notice, sir,&rsquo; said Tacker.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Then,&rsquo; rejoined Mr Mould, putting up his watch, and glancing at himself
      in the little shaving-glass, that he might be sure his face had the right
      expression on it; &lsquo;then I think we may proceed to business. Give me the
      paper of gloves, Tacker. Ah, what a man he was! Ah, Tacker, Tacker, what a
      man he was!&rsquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      Mr Tacker, who from his great experience in the performance of funerals,
      would have made an excellent pantomime actor, winked at Mrs Gamp without
      at all disturbing the gravity of his countenance, and followed his master
      into the next room.
    </p>
    <p>
      It was a great point with Mr Mould, and a part of his professional tact,
      not to seem to know the doctor; though in reality they were near
      neighbours, and very often, as in the present instance, worked together.
      So he advanced to fit on his black kid gloves as if he had never seen him
      in all his life; while the doctor, on his part, looked as distant and
      unconscious as if he had heard and read of undertakers, and had passed
      their shops, but had never before been brought into communication with
      one.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Gloves, eh?&rsquo; said the doctor. &lsquo;Mr Pecksniff after you.&rsquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;I couldn&rsquo;t think of it,&rsquo; returned Mr Pecksniff.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;You are very good,&rsquo; said the doctor, taking a pair. &lsquo;Well, sir, as I was
      saying&mdash;I was called up to attend that case at about half-past one
      o&rsquo;clock. Cake and wine, eh? Which is port? Thank you.&rsquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      Mr Pecksniff took some also.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;At about half-past one o&rsquo;clock in the morning, sir,&rsquo; resumed the doctor,
      &lsquo;I was called up to attend that case. At the first pull of the night-bell
      I turned out, threw up the window, and put out my head. Cloak, eh? Don&rsquo;t
      tie it too tight. That&rsquo;ll do.&rsquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      Mr Pecksniff having been likewise inducted into a similar garment, the
      doctor resumed.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;And put out my head&mdash;hat, eh? My good friend, that is not mine. Mr
      Pecksniff, I beg your pardon, but I think we have unintentionally made an
      exchange. Thank you. Well, sir, I was going to tell you&mdash;&rsquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;We are quite ready,&rsquo; interrupted Mould in a low voice.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Ready, eh?&rsquo; said the doctor. &lsquo;Very good, Mr Pecksniff, I&rsquo;ll take an
      opportunity of relating the rest in the coach. It&rsquo;s rather curious. Ready,
      eh? No rain, I hope?&rsquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Quite fair, sir,&rsquo; returned Mould.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;I was afraid the ground would have been wet,&rsquo; said the doctor, &lsquo;for my
      glass fell yesterday. We may congratulate ourselves upon our good
      fortune.&rsquo; But seeing by this time that Mr Jonas and Chuffey were going out
      at the door, he put a white pocket-handkerchief to his face as if a
      violent burst of grief had suddenly come upon him, and walked down side by
      side with Mr Pecksniff.
    </p>
    <p>
      Mr Mould and his men had not exaggerated the grandeur of the arrangements.
      They were splendid. The four hearse-horses, especially, reared and
      pranced, and showed their highest action, as if they knew a man was dead,
      and triumphed in it. &lsquo;They break us, drive us, ride us; ill-treat, abuse,
      and maim us for their pleasure&mdash;But they die; Hurrah, they die!&rsquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      So through the narrow streets and winding city ways, went Anthony
      Chuzzlewit&rsquo;s funeral; Mr Jonas glancing stealthily out of the coach-window
      now and then, to observe its effect upon the crowd; Mr Mould as he walked
      along, listening with a sober pride to the exclamations of the bystanders;
      the doctor whispering his story to Mr Pecksniff, without appearing to come
      any nearer the end of it; and poor old Chuffey sobbing unregarded in a
      corner. But he had greatly scandalized Mr Mould at an early stage of the
      ceremony by carrying his handkerchief in his hat in a perfectly informal
      manner, and wiping his eyes with his knuckles. And as Mr Mould himself had
      said already, his behaviour was indecent, and quite unworthy of such an
      occasion; and he never ought to have been there.
    </p>
    <p>
      There he was, however; and in the churchyard there he was, also,
      conducting himself in a no less unbecoming manner, and leaning for support
      on Tacker, who plainly told him that he was fit for nothing better than a
      walking funeral. But Chuffey, Heaven help him! heard no sound but the
      echoes, lingering in his own heart, of a voice for ever silent.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;I loved him,&rsquo; cried the old man, sinking down upon the grave when all was
      done. &lsquo;He was very good to me. Oh, my dear old friend and master!&rsquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Come, come, Mr Chuffey,&rsquo; said the doctor, &lsquo;this won&rsquo;t do; it&rsquo;s a clayey
      soil, Mr Chuffey. You mustn&rsquo;t, really.&rsquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;If it had been the commonest thing we do, and Mr Chuffey had been a
      Bearer, gentlemen,&rsquo; said Mould, casting an imploring glance upon them, as
      he helped to raise him, &lsquo;he couldn&rsquo;t have gone on worse than this.&rsquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Be a man, Mr Chuffey,&rsquo; said Pecksniff.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Be a gentleman, Mr Chuffey,&rsquo; said Mould.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Upon my word, my good friend,&rsquo; murmured the doctor, in a tone of stately
      reproof, as he stepped up to the old man&rsquo;s side, &lsquo;this is worse than
      weakness. This is bad, selfish, very wrong, Mr Chuffey. You should take
      example from others, my good sir. You forget that you were not connected
      by ties of blood with our deceased friend; and that he had a very near and
      very dear relation, Mr Chuffey.&rsquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Aye, his own son!&rsquo; cried the old man, clasping his hands with remarkable
      passion. &lsquo;His own, own, only son!&rsquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;He&rsquo;s not right in his head, you know,&rsquo; said Jonas, turning pale. &lsquo;You&rsquo;re
      not to mind anything he says. I shouldn&rsquo;t wonder if he was to talk some
      precious nonsense. But don&rsquo;t you mind him, any of you. I don&rsquo;t. My father
      left him to my charge; and whatever he says or does, that&rsquo;s enough. I&rsquo;ll
      take care of him.&rsquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      A hum of admiration rose from the mourners (including Mr Mould and his
      merry men) at this new instance of magnanimity and kind feeling on the
      part of Jonas. But Chuffey put it to the test no farther. He said not a
      word more, and being left to himself for a little while, crept back again
      to the coach.
    </p>
    <p>
      It has been said that Mr Jonas turned pale when the behaviour of the old
      clerk attracted general attention; his discomposure, however, was but
      momentary, and he soon recovered. But these were not the only changes he
      had exhibited that day. The curious eyes of Mr Pecksniff had observed that
      as soon as they left the house upon their mournful errand, he began to
      mend; that as the ceremonies proceeded he gradually, by little and little,
      recovered his old condition, his old looks, his old bearing, his old
      agreeable characteristics of speech and manner, and became, in all
      respects, his old pleasant self. And now that they were seated in the
      coach on their return home; and more when they got there, and found the
      windows open, the light and air admitted, and all traces of the late event
      removed; he felt so well convinced that Jonas was again the Jonas he had
      known a week ago, and not the Jonas of the intervening time, that he
      voluntarily gave up his recently-acquired power without one faint attempt
      to exercise it, and at once fell back into his former position of mild and
      deferential guest.
    </p>
    <p>
      Mrs Gamp went home to the bird-fancier&rsquo;s, and was knocked up again that
      very night for a birth of twins; Mr Mould dined gayly in the bosom of his
      family, and passed the evening facetiously at his club; the hearse, after
      standing for a long time at the door of a roistering public-house,
      repaired to its stables with the feathers inside and twelve red-nosed
      undertakers on the roof, each holding on by a dingy peg, to which, in
      times of state, a waving plume was fitted; the various trappings of sorrow
      were carefully laid by in presses for the next hirer; the fiery steeds
      were quenched and quiet in their stalls; the doctor got merry with wine at
      a wedding-dinner, and forgot the middle of the story which had no end to
      it; the pageant of a few short hours ago was written nowhere half so
      legibly as in the undertaker&rsquo;s books.
    </p>
    <p>
      Not in the churchyard? Not even there. The gates were closed; the night
      was dark and wet; the rain fell silently, among the stagnant weeds and
      nettles. One new mound was there which had not been there last night.
      Time, burrowing like a mole below the ground, had marked his track by
      throwing up another heap of earth. And that was all.

    <h2>
      CHAPTER TWENTY
    </h2>
    <h3>
      IS A CHAPTER OF LOVE
    </h3>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Pecksniff,&rsquo; said Jonas, taking off his hat, to see that the black crape
      band was all right; and finding that it was, putting it on again,
      complacently; &lsquo;what do you mean to give your daughters when they marry?&rsquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;My dear Mr Jonas,&rsquo; cried the affectionate parent, with an ingenuous
      smile, &lsquo;what a very singular inquiry!&rsquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Now, don&rsquo;t you mind whether it&rsquo;s a singular inquiry or a plural one,&rsquo;
      retorted Jonas, eyeing Mr Pecksniff with no great favour, &lsquo;but answer it,
      or let it alone. One or the other.&rsquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Hum! The question, my dear friend,&rsquo; said Mr Pecksniff, laying his hand
      tenderly upon his kinsman&rsquo;s knee, &lsquo;is involved with many considerations.
      What would I give them? Eh?&rsquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Ah! what would you give &lsquo;em?&rsquo; repeated Jonas.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Why, that, &lsquo;said Mr Pecksniff, &lsquo;would naturally depend in a great measure
      upon the kind of husbands they might choose, my dear young friend.&rsquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      Mr Jonas was evidently disconcerted, and at a loss how to proceed. It was
      a good answer. It seemed a deep one, but such is the wisdom of
      simplicity!&rsquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;My standard for the merits I would require in a son-in-law,&rsquo; said Mr
      Pecksniff, after a short silence, &lsquo;is a high one. Forgive me, my dear Mr
      Jonas,&rsquo; he added, greatly moved, &lsquo;if I say that you have spoiled me, and
      made it a fanciful one; an imaginative one; a prismatically tinged one, if
      I may be permitted to call it so.&rsquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;What do you mean by that?&rsquo; growled Jonas, looking at him with increased
      disfavour.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Indeed, my dear friend,&rsquo; said Mr Pecksniff, &lsquo;you may well inquire. The
      heart is not always a royal mint, with patent machinery to work its metal
      into current coin. Sometimes it throws it out in strange forms, not easily
      recognized as coin at all. But it is sterling gold. It has at least that
      merit. It is sterling gold.&rsquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Is it?&rsquo; grumbled Jonas, with a doubtful shake of the head.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Aye!&rsquo; said Mr Pecksniff, warming with his subject &lsquo;it is. To be plain
      with you, Mr Jonas, if I could find two such sons-in-law as you will one
      day make to some deserving man, capable of appreciating a nature such as
      yours, I would&mdash;forgetful of myself&mdash;bestow upon my daughters
      portions reaching to the very utmost limit of my means.&rsquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      This was strong language, and it was earnestly delivered. But who can
      wonder that such a man as Mr Pecksniff, after all he had seen and heard of
      Mr Jonas, should be strong and earnest upon such a theme; a theme that
      touched even the worldly lips of undertakers with the honey of eloquence!
    </p>
    <p>
      Mr Jonas was silent, and looked thoughtfully at the landscape. For they
      were seated on the outside of the coach, at the back, and were travelling
      down into the country. He accompanied Mr Pecksniff home for a few days&rsquo;
      change of air and scene after his recent trials.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Well,&rsquo; he said, at last, with captivating bluntness, &lsquo;suppose you got one
      such son-in-law as me, what then?&rsquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      Mr Pecksniff regarded him at first with inexpressible surprise; then
      gradually breaking into a sort of dejected vivacity, said:
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Then well I know whose husband he would be!&rsquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Whose?&rsquo; asked Jonas, drily.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;My eldest girl&rsquo;s, Mr Jonas,&rsquo; replied Pecksniff, with moistening eyes. &lsquo;My
      dear Cherry&rsquo;s; my staff, my scrip, my treasure, Mr Jonas. A hard struggle,
      but it is in the nature of things! I must one day part with her to a
      husband. I know it, my dear friend. I am prepared for it.&rsquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Ecod! you&rsquo;ve been prepared for that a pretty long time, I should think,&rsquo;
      said Jonas.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Many have sought to bear her from me,&rsquo; said Mr Pecksniff. &lsquo;All have
      failed. &ldquo;I never will give my hand, papa&rdquo;&mdash;those were her words&mdash;&ldquo;unless
      my heart is won.&rdquo; She has not been quite so happy as she used to be, of
      late. I don&rsquo;t know why.&rsquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      Again Mr Jonas looked at the landscape; then at the coachman; then at the
      luggage on the roof; finally at Mr Pecksniff.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;I suppose you&rsquo;ll have to part with the other one, some of these days?&rsquo; he
      observed, as he caught that gentleman&rsquo;s eye.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Probably,&rsquo; said the parent. &lsquo;Years will tame down the wildness of my
      foolish bird, and then it will be caged. But Cherry, Mr Jonas, Cherry&mdash;&rsquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Oh, ah!&rsquo; interrupted Jonas. &lsquo;Years have made her all right enough. Nobody
      doubts that. But you haven&rsquo;t answered what I asked you. Of course, you&rsquo;re
      not obliged to do it, you know, if you don&rsquo;t like. You&rsquo;re the best judge.&rsquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      There was a warning sulkiness in the manner of this speech, which
      admonished Mr Pecksniff that his dear friend was not to be trifled with or
      fenced off, and that he must either return a straight-forward reply to his
      question, or plainly give him to understand that he declined to enlighten
      him upon the subject to which it referred. Mindful in this dilemma of the
      caution old Anthony had given him almost with his latest breath, he
      resolved to speak to the point, and so told Mr Jonas (enlarging upon the
      communication as a proof of his great attachment and confidence), that in
      the case he had put; to wit, in the event of such a man as he proposing
      for his daughter&rsquo;s hand, he would endow her with a fortune of four
      thousand pounds.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;I should sadly pinch and cramp myself to do so,&rsquo; was his fatherly remark;
      &lsquo;but that would be my duty, and my conscience would reward me. For myself,
      my conscience is my bank. I have a trifle invested there&mdash;a mere
      trifle, Mr Jonas&mdash;but I prize it as a store of value, I assure you.&rsquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      The good man&rsquo;s enemies would have divided upon this question into two
      parties. One would have asserted without scruple that if Mr Pecksniff&rsquo;s
      conscience were his bank, and he kept a running account there, he must
      have overdrawn it beyond all mortal means of computation. The other would
      have contended that it was a mere fictitious form; a perfectly blank book;
      or one in which entries were only made with a peculiar kind of invisible
      ink to become legible at some indefinite time; and that he never troubled
      it at all.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;It would sadly pinch and cramp me, my dear friend,&rsquo; repeated Mr
      Pecksniff, &lsquo;but Providence&mdash;perhaps I may be permitted to say a
      special Providence&mdash;has blessed my endeavours, and I could guarantee
      to make the sacrifice.&rsquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      A question of philosophy arises here, whether Mr Pecksniff had or had not
      good reason to say that he was specially patronized and encouraged in his
      undertakings. All his life long he had been walking up and down the narrow
      ways and by-places, with a hook in one hand and a crook in the other,
      scraping all sorts of valuable odds and ends into his pouch. Now, there
      being a special Providence in the fall of a sparrow, it follows (so Mr
      Pecksniff, and only such admirable men, would have reasoned), that there
      must also be a special Providence in the alighting of the stone or stick,
      or other substance which is aimed at the sparrow. And Mr Pecksniff&rsquo;s hook,
      or crook, having invariably knocked the sparrow on the head and brought
      him down, that gentleman may have been led to consider himself as
      specially licensed to bag sparrows, and as being specially seized and
      possessed of all the birds he had got together. That many undertakings,
      national as well as individual&mdash;but especially the former&mdash;are
      held to be specially brought to a glorious and successful issue, which
      never could be so regarded on any other process of reasoning, must be
      clear to all men. Therefore the precedents would seem to show that Mr
      Pecksniff had (as things go) good argument for what he said and might be
      permitted to say it, and did not say it presumptuously, vainly, or
      arrogantly, but in a spirit of high faith and great wisdom.
    </p>
    <p>
      Mr Jonas, not being much accustomed to perplex his mind with theories of
      this nature, expressed no opinion on the subject. Nor did he receive his
      companion&rsquo;s announcement with one solitary syllable, good, bad, or
      indifferent. He preserved this taciturnity for a quarter of an hour at
      least, and during the whole of that time appeared to be steadily engaged
      in subjecting some given amount to the operation of every known rule in
      figures; adding to it, taking from it, multiplying it, reducing it by long
      and short division; working it by the rule-of-three direct and inversed;
      exchange or barter; practice; simple interest; compound interest; and
      other means of arithmetical calculation. The result of these labours
      appeared to be satisfactory, for when he did break silence, it was as one
      who had arrived at some specific result, and freed himself from a state of
      distressing uncertainty.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Come, old Pecksniff!&rsquo;&mdash;Such was his jocose address, as he slapped
      that gentleman on the back, at the end of the stage&mdash;&lsquo;let&rsquo;s have
      something!&rsquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;With all my heart,&rsquo; said Mr Pecksniff.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Let&rsquo;s treat the driver,&rsquo; cried Jonas.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;If you think it won&rsquo;t hurt the man, or render him discontented with his
      station&mdash;certainly,&rsquo; faltered Mr Pecksniff.
    </p>
    <p>
      Jonas only laughed at this, and getting down from the coach-top with great
      alacrity, cut a cumbersome kind of caper in the road. After which, he went
      into the public-house, and there ordered spirituous drink to such an
      extent, that Mr Pecksniff had some doubts of his perfect sanity, until
      Jonas set them quite at rest by saying, when the coach could wait no
      longer:
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;I&rsquo;ve been standing treat for a whole week and more, and letting you have
      all the delicacies of the season. <i>You </i>shall pay for this Pecksniff.&rsquo; It
      was not a joke either, as Mr Pecksniff at first supposed; for he went off
      to the coach without further ceremony, and left his respected victim to
      settle the bill.
    </p>
    <p>
      But Mr Pecksniff was a man of meek endurance, and Mr Jonas was his friend.
      Moreover, his regard for that gentleman was founded, as we know, on pure
      esteem, and a knowledge of the excellence of his character. He came out
      from the tavern with a smiling face, and even went so far as to repeat the
      performance, on a less expensive scale, at the next ale-house. There was a
      certain wildness in the spirits of Mr Jonas (not usually a part of his
      character) which was far from being subdued by these means, and, for the
      rest of the journey, he was so very buoyant&mdash;it may be said,
      boisterous&mdash;that Mr Pecksniff had some difficulty in keeping pace
      with him.
    </p>
    <p>
      They were not expected&mdash;oh dear, no! Mr Pecksniff had proposed in
      London to give the girls a surprise, and had said he wouldn&rsquo;t write a word
      to prepare them on any account, in order that he and Mr Jonas might take
      them unawares, and just see what they were doing, when they thought their
      dear papa was miles and miles away. As a consequence of this playful
      device, there was nobody to meet them at the finger-post, but that was of
      small consequence, for they had come down by the day coach, and Mr
      Pecksniff had only a carpetbag, while Mr Jonas had only a portmanteau.
      They took the portmanteau between them, put the bag upon it, and walked
      off up the lane without delay; Mr Pecksniff already going on tiptoe as if,
      without this precaution, his fond children, being then at a distance of a
      couple of miles or so, would have some filial sense of his approach.
    </p>
    <p>
      It was a lovely evening in the spring-time of the year; and in the soft
      stillness of the twilight, all nature was very calm and beautiful. The day
      had been fine and warm; but at the coming on of night, the air grew cool,
      and in the mellowing distance smoke was rising gently from the cottage
      chimneys. There were a thousand pleasant scents diffused around, from
      young leaves and fresh buds; the cuckoo had been singing all day long, and
      was but just now hushed; the smell of earth newly-upturned, first breath
      of hope to the first labourer after his garden withered, was fragrant in
      the evening breeze. It was a time when most men cherish good resolves, and
      sorrow for the wasted past; when most men, looking on the shadows as they
      gather, think of that evening which must close on all, and that to-morrow
      which has none beyond.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Precious dull,&rsquo; said Mr Jonas, looking about. &lsquo;It&rsquo;s enough to make a man
      go melancholy mad.&rsquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;We shall have lights and a fire soon,&rsquo; observed Mr Pecksniff.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;We shall need &lsquo;em by the time we get there,&rsquo; said Jonas. &lsquo;Why the devil
      don&rsquo;t you talk? What are you thinking of?&rsquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;To tell you the truth, Mr Jonas,&rsquo; said Pecksniff with great solemnity,
      &lsquo;my mind was running at that moment on our late dear friend, your departed
      father.&rsquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      Mr Jonas immediately let his burden fall, and said, threatening him with
      his hand:
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Drop that, Pecksniff!&rsquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      Mr Pecksniff not exactly knowing whether allusion was made to the subject
      or the portmanteau, stared at his friend in unaffected surprise.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Drop it, I say!&rsquo; cried Jonas, fiercely. &lsquo;Do you hear? Drop it, now and
      for ever. You had better, I give you notice!&rsquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;It was quite a mistake,&rsquo; urged Mr Pecksniff, very much dismayed; &lsquo;though
      I admit it was foolish. I might have known it was a tender string.&rsquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Don&rsquo;t talk to me about tender strings,&rsquo; said Jonas, wiping his forehead
      with the cuff of his coat. &lsquo;I&rsquo;m not going to be crowed over by you,
      because I don&rsquo;t like dead company.&rsquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      Mr Pecksniff had got out the words &lsquo;Crowed over, Mr Jonas!&rsquo; when that
      young man, with a dark expression in his countenance, cut him short once
      more:
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Mind!&rsquo; he said. &lsquo;I won&rsquo;t have it. I advise you not to revive the subject,
      neither to me nor anybody else. You can take a hint, if you choose as well
      as another man. There&rsquo;s enough said about it. Come along!&rsquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      Taking up his part of the load again, when he had said these words, he
      hurried on so fast that Mr Pecksniff, at the other end of the portmanteau,
      found himself dragged forward, in a very inconvenient and ungraceful
      manner, to the great detriment of what is called by fancy gentlemen &lsquo;the
      bark&rsquo; upon his shins, which were most unmercifully bumped against the hard
      leather and the iron buckles. In the course of a few minutes, however, Mr
      Jonas relaxed his speed, and suffered his companion to come up with him,
      and to bring the portmanteau into a tolerably straight position.
    </p>
    <p>
      It was pretty clear that he regretted his late outbreak, and that he
      mistrusted its effect on Mr Pecksniff; for as often as that gentleman
      glanced towards Mr Jonas, he found Mr Jonas glancing at him, which was a
      new source of embarrassment. It was but a short-lived one, though, for Mr
      Jonas soon began to whistle, whereupon Mr Pecksniff, taking his cue from
      his friend, began to hum a tune melodiously.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Pretty nearly there, ain&rsquo;t we?&rsquo; said Jonas, when this had lasted some
      time.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Close, my dear friend,&rsquo; said Mr Pecksniff.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;What&rsquo;ll they be doing, do you suppose?&rsquo; asked Jonas.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Impossible to say,&rsquo; cried Mr Pecksniff. &lsquo;Giddy truants! They may be away
      from home, perhaps. I was going to&mdash;he! he! he!&mdash;I was going to
      propose,&rsquo; said Mr Pecksniff, &lsquo;that we should enter by the back way, and
      come upon them like a clap of thunder, Mr Jonas.&rsquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      It might not have been easy to decide in respect of which of their
      manifold properties, Jonas, Mr Pecksniff, the carpet-bag, and the
      portmanteau, could be likened to a clap of thunder. But Mr Jonas giving
      his assent to this proposal, they stole round into the back yard, and
      softly advanced towards the kitchen window, through which the mingled
      light of fire and candle shone upon the darkening night.
    </p>
    <p>
      Truly Mr Pecksniff is blessed in his children&mdash;in one of them, at any
      rate. The prudent Cherry&mdash;staff and scrip, and treasure of her doting
      father&mdash;there she sits, at a little table white as driven snow,
      before the kitchen fire, making up accounts! See the neat maiden, as with
      pen in hand, and calculating look addressed towards the ceiling and bunch
      of keys within a little basket at her side, she checks the housekeeping
      expenditure! From flat-iron, dish-cover, and warming-pan; from pot and
      kettle, face of brass footman, and black-leaded stove; bright glances of
      approbation wink and glow upon her. The very onions dangling from the
      beam, mantle and shine like cherubs&rsquo; cheeks. Something of the influence of
      those vegetables sinks into Mr Pecksniff&rsquo;s nature. He weeps.
    </p>
    <p>
      It is but for a moment, and he hides it from the observation of his friend&mdash;very
      carefully&mdash;by a somewhat elaborate use of his pocket-handkerchief, in
      fact; for he would not have his weakness known.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Pleasant,&rsquo; he murmured, &lsquo;pleasant to a father&rsquo;s feelings! My dear girl!
      Shall we let her know we are here, Mr Jonas?&rsquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Why, I suppose you don&rsquo;t mean to spend the evening in the stable, or the
      coach-house,&rsquo; he returned.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;That, indeed, is not such hospitality as I would show to <i>you</i>, my friend,&rsquo;
      cried Mr Pecksniff, pressing his hand. And then he took a long breath, and
      tapping at the window, shouted with stentorian blandness:
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Boh!&rsquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      Cherry dropped her pen and screamed. But innocence is ever bold, or should
      be. As they opened the door, the valiant girl exclaimed in a firm voice,
      and with a presence of mind which even in that trying moment did not
      desert her, &lsquo;Who are you? What do you want? Speak! or I will call my Pa.&rsquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      Mr Pecksniff held out his arms. She knew him instantly, and rushed into
      his fond embrace.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;It was thoughtless of us, Mr Jonas, it was very thoughtless,&rsquo; said
      Pecksniff, smoothing his daugther&rsquo;s hair. &lsquo;My darling, do you see that I
      am not alone!&rsquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      Not she. She had seen nothing but her father until now. She saw Mr Jonas
      now, though; and blushed, and hung her head down, as she gave him welcome.
    </p>
    <p>
      But where was Merry? Mr Pecksniff didn&rsquo;t ask the question in reproach, but
      in a vein of mildness touched with a gentle sorrow. She was upstairs,
      reading on the parlour couch. Ah! Domestic details had no charms for <i>her</i>.
      &lsquo;But call her down,&rsquo; said Mr Pecksniff, with a placid resignation. &lsquo;Call
      her down, my love.&rsquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      She was called and came, all flushed and tumbled from reposing on the
      sofa; but none the worse for that. No, not at all. Rather the better, if
      anything.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Oh my goodness me!&rsquo; cried the arch girl, turning to her cousin when she
      had kissed her father on both cheeks, and in her frolicsome nature had
      bestowed a supernumerary salute upon the tip of his nose, &lsquo;<i>You </i>here,
      fright! Well, I&rsquo;m very thankful that you won&rsquo;t trouble <i>me</i> much!&rsquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;What! you&rsquo;re as lively as ever, are you?&rsquo; said Jonas. &lsquo;Oh! You&rsquo;re a
      wicked one!&rsquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;There, go along!&rsquo; retorted Merry, pushing him away. &lsquo;I&rsquo;m sure I don&rsquo;t
      know what I shall ever do, if I have to see much of you. Go along, for
      gracious&rsquo; sake!&rsquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      Mr Pecksniff striking in here, with a request that Mr Jonas would
      immediately walk upstairs, he so far complied with the young lady&rsquo;s
      adjuration as to go at once. But though he had the fair Cherry on his arm,
      he could not help looking back at her sister, and exchanging some further
      dialogue of the same bantering description, as they all four ascended to
      the parlour; where&mdash;for the young ladies happened, by good fortune,
      to be a little later than usual that night&mdash;the tea-board was at that
      moment being set out.
    </p>
    <p>
      Mr Pinch was not at home, so they had it all to themselves, and were very
      snug and talkative, Jonas sitting between the two sisters, and displaying
      his gallantry in that engaging manner which was peculiar to him. It was a
      hard thing, Mr Pecksniff said, when tea was done, and cleared away, to
      leave so pleasant a little party, but having some important papers to
      examine in his own apartment, he must beg them to excuse him for half an
      hour. With this apology he withdrew, singing a careless strain as he went.
      He had not been gone five minutes, when Merry, who had been sitting in the
      window, apart from Jonas and her sister, burst into a half-smothered
      laugh, and skipped towards the door.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Hallo!&rsquo; cried Jonas. &lsquo;Don&rsquo;t go.&rsquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Oh, I dare say!&rsquo; rejoined Merry, looking back. &lsquo;You&rsquo;re very anxious I
      should stay, fright, ain&rsquo;t you?&rsquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Yes, I am,&rsquo; said Jonas. &lsquo;Upon my word I am. I want to speak to you.&rsquo; But
      as she left the room notwithstanding, he ran out after her, and brought
      her back, after a short struggle in the passage which scandalized Miss
      Cherry very much.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Upon my word, Merry,&rsquo; urged that young lady, &lsquo;I wonder at you! There are
      bounds even to absurdity, my dear.&rsquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Thank you, my sweet,&rsquo; said Merry, pursing up her rosy Lips. &lsquo;Much obliged
      to it for its advice. Oh! do leave me alone, you monster, do!&rsquo; This
      entreaty was wrung from her by a new proceeding on the part of Mr Jonas,
      who pulled her down, all breathless as she was, into a seat beside him on
      the sofa, having at the same time Miss Cherry upon the other side.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Now,&rsquo; said Jonas, clasping the waist of each; &lsquo;I have got both arms full,
      haven&rsquo;t I?&rsquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;One of them will be black and blue to-morrow, if you don&rsquo;t let me go,&rsquo;
      cried the playful Merry.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Ah! I don&rsquo;t mind <i>your </i>pinching,&rsquo; grinned Jonas, &lsquo;a bit.&rsquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Pinch him for me, Cherry, pray,&rsquo; said Mercy. &lsquo;I never did hate anybody so
      much as I hate this creature, I declare!&rsquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;No, no, don&rsquo;t say that,&rsquo; urged Jonas, &lsquo;and don&rsquo;t pinch either, because I
      want to be serious. I say&mdash;Cousin Charity&mdash;&rsquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Well! what?&rsquo; she answered sharply.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;I want to have some sober talk,&rsquo; said Jonas; &lsquo;I want to prevent any
      mistakes, you know, and to put everything upon a pleasant understanding.
      That&rsquo;s desirable and proper, ain&rsquo;t it?&rsquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      Neither of the sisters spoke a word. Mr Jonas paused and cleared his
      throat, which was very dry.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;She&rsquo;ll not believe what I am going to say, will she, cousin?&rsquo; said Jonas,
      timidly squeezing Miss Charity.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Really, Mr Jonas, I don&rsquo;t know, until I hear what it is. It&rsquo;s quite
      impossible!&rsquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Why, you see,&rsquo; said Jonas, &lsquo;her way always being to make game of people,
      I know she&rsquo;ll laugh, or pretend to&mdash;I know that, beforehand. But you
      can tell her I&rsquo;m in earnest, cousin; can&rsquo;t you? You&rsquo;ll confess you know,
      won&rsquo;t you? You&rsquo;ll be honourable, I&rsquo;m sure,&rsquo; he added persuasively.
    </p>
    <p>
      No answer. His throat seemed to grow hotter and hotter, and to be more and
      more difficult of control.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;You see, Cousin Charity,&rsquo; said Jonas, &lsquo;nobody but you can tell her what
      pains I took to get into her company when you were both at the
      boarding-house in the city, because nobody&rsquo;s so well aware of it, you
      know. Nobody else can tell her how hard I tried to get to know you better,
      in order that I might get to know her without seeming to wish it; can
      they? I always asked you about her, and said where had she gone, and when
      would she come, and how lively she was, and all that; didn&rsquo;t I, cousin? I
      know you&rsquo;ll tell her so, if you haven&rsquo;t told her so already, and&mdash;and&mdash;I
      dare say you have, because I&rsquo;m sure you&rsquo;re honourable, ain&rsquo;t you?&rsquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      Still not a word. The right arm of Mr Jonas&mdash;the elder sister sat
      upon his right&mdash;may have been sensible of some tumultuous throbbing
      which was not within itself; but nothing else apprised him that his words
      had had the least effect.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Even if you kept it to yourself, and haven&rsquo;t told her,&rsquo; resumed Jonas,
      &lsquo;it don&rsquo;t much matter, because you&rsquo;ll bear honest witness now; won&rsquo;t you?
      We&rsquo;ve been very good friends from the first; haven&rsquo;t we? and of course we
      shall be quite friends in future, and so I don&rsquo;t mind speaking before you
      a bit. Cousin Mercy, you&rsquo;ve heard what I&rsquo;ve been saying. She&rsquo;ll confirm
      it, every word; she must. Will you have me for your husband? Eh?&rsquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      As he released his hold of Charity, to put this question with better
      effect, she started up and hurried away to her own room, marking her
      progress as she went by such a train of passionate and incoherent sound,
      as nothing but a slighted woman in her anger could produce.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Let me go away. Let me go after her,&rsquo; said Merry, pushing him off, and
      giving him&mdash;to tell the truth&mdash;more than one sounding slap upon
      his outstretched face.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Not till you say yes. You haven&rsquo;t told me. Will you have me for your
      husband?&rsquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;No, I won&rsquo;t. I can&rsquo;t bear the sight of you. I have told you so a hundred
      times. You are a fright. Besides, I always thought you liked my sister
      best. We all thought so.&rsquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;But that wasn&rsquo;t my fault,&rsquo; said Jonas.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Yes it was; you know it was.&rsquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Any trick is fair in love,&rsquo; said Jonas. &lsquo;She may have thought I liked her
      best, but you didn&rsquo;t.&rsquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;I did!&rsquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;No, you didn&rsquo;t. You never could have thought I liked her best, when you
      were by.&rsquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;There&rsquo;s no accounting for tastes,&rsquo; said Merry; &lsquo;at least I didn&rsquo;t mean to
      say that. I don&rsquo;t know what I mean. Let me go to her.&rsquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Say &ldquo;Yes,&rdquo; and then I will.&rsquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;If I ever brought myself to say so, it should only be that I might hate
      and tease you all my life.&rsquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;That&rsquo;s as good,&rsquo; cried Jonas, &lsquo;as saying it right out. It&rsquo;s a bargain,
      cousin. We&rsquo;re a pair, if ever there was one.&rsquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      This gallant speech was succeeded by a confused noise of kissing and
      slapping; and then the fair but much dishevelled Merry broke away, and
      followed in the footsteps of her sister.
    </p>
    <p>
      Now whether Mr Pecksniff had been listening&mdash;which in one of his
      character appears impossible; or divined almost by inspiration what the
      matter was&mdash;which, in a man of his sagacity is far more probable; or
      happened by sheer good fortune to find himself in exactly the right place,
      at precisely the right time&mdash;which, under the special guardianship in
      which he lived might very reasonably happen; it is quite certain that at
      the moment when the sisters came together in their own room, he appeared
      at the chamber door. And a marvellous contrast it was&mdash;they so
      heated, noisy, and vehement; he so calm, so self-possessed, so cool and
      full of peace, that not a hair upon his head was stirred.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Children!&rsquo; said Mr Pecksniff, spreading out his hands in wonder, but not
      before he had shut the door, and set his back against it. &lsquo;Girls!
      Daughters! What is this?&rsquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;The wretch; the apostate; the false, mean, odious villain; has before my
      very face proposed to Mercy!&rsquo; was his eldest daughter&rsquo;s answer.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Who has proposed to Mercy!&rsquo; asked Mr Pecksniff.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;<i>He</i> has. That thing, Jonas, downstairs.&rsquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Jonas proposed to Mercy?&rsquo; said Mr Pecksniff. &lsquo;Aye, aye! Indeed!&rsquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Have you nothing else to say?&rsquo; cried Charity. &lsquo;Am I to be driven mad,
      papa? He has proposed to Mercy, not to me.&rsquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Oh, fie! For shame!&rsquo; said Mr Pecksniff, gravely. &lsquo;Oh, for shame! Can the
      triumph of a sister move you to this terrible display, my child? Oh,
      really this is very sad! I am sorry; I am surprised and hurt to see you
      so. Mercy, my girl, bless you! See to her. Ah, envy, envy, what a passion
      you are!&rsquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      Uttering this apostrophe in a tone full of grief and lamentation, Mr
      Pecksniff left the room (taking care to shut the door behind him), and
      walked downstairs into the parlour. There he found his intended
      son-in-law, whom he seized by both hands.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Jonas!&rsquo; cried Mr Pecksniff. &lsquo;Jonas! the dearest wish of my heart is now
      fulfilled!&rsquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Very well; I&rsquo;m glad to hear it,&rsquo; said Jonas. &lsquo;That&rsquo;ll do. I say! As it
      ain&rsquo;t the one you&rsquo;re so fond of, you must come down with another thousand,
      Pecksniff. You must make it up five. It&rsquo;s worth that, to keep your
      treasure to yourself, you know. You get off very cheap that way, and
      haven&rsquo;t a sacrifice to make.&rsquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      The grin with which he accompanied this, set off his other attractions to
      such unspeakable advantage, that even Mr Pecksniff lost his presence of
      mind for a moment, and looked at the young man as if he were quite
      stupefied with wonder and admiration. But he quickly regained his
      composure, and was in the very act of changing the subject, when a hasty
      step was heard without, and Tom Pinch, in a state of great excitement,
      came darting into the room.
    </p>
    <p>
      On seeing a stranger there, apparently engaged with Mr Pecksniff in
      private conversation, Tom was very much abashed, though he still looked as
      if he had something of great importance to communicate, which would be a
      sufficient apology for his intrusion.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Mr Pinch,&rsquo; said Pecksniff, &lsquo;this is hardly decent. You will excuse my
      saying that I think your conduct scarcely decent, Mr Pinch.&rsquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;I beg your pardon, sir,&rsquo; replied Tom, &lsquo;for not knocking at the door.&rsquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Rather beg this gentleman&rsquo;s pardon, Mr Pinch,&rsquo; said Pecksniff. &lsquo;I know
      you; he does not.&mdash;My young man, Mr Jonas.&rsquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      The son-in-law that was to be gave him a slight nod&mdash;not actively
      disdainful or contemptuous, only passively; for he was in a good humour.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Could I speak a word with you, sir, if you please?&rsquo; said Tom. &lsquo;It&rsquo;s
      rather pressing.&rsquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;It should be very pressing to justify this strange behaviour, Mr Pinch,&rsquo;
      returned his master. &lsquo;Excuse me for one moment, my dear friend. Now, sir,
      what is the reason of this rough intrusion?&rsquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;I am very sorry, sir, I am sure,&rsquo; said Tom, standing, cap in hand, before
      his patron in the passage; &lsquo;and I know it must have a very rude appearance&mdash;&rsquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;It <i>has </i>a very rude appearance, Mr Pinch.&rsquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Yes, I feel that, sir; but the truth is, I was so surprised to see them,
      and knew you would be too, that I ran home very fast indeed, and really
      hadn&rsquo;t enough command over myself to know what I was doing very well. I
      was in the church just now, sir, touching the organ for my own amusement,
      when I happened to look round, and saw a gentleman and lady standing in
      the aisle listening. They seemed to be strangers, sir, as well as I could
      make out in the dusk; and I thought I didn&rsquo;t know them; so presently I
      left off, and said, would they walk up into the organ-loft, or take a
      seat? No, they said, they wouldn&rsquo;t do that; but they thanked me for the
      music they had heard. In fact,&rsquo; observed Tom, blushing, &lsquo;they said,
      &ldquo;Delicious music!&rdquo; at least, <i>she </i>did; and I am sure that was a greater
      pleasure and honour to me than any compliment I could have had. I&mdash;I&mdash;beg
      your pardon sir;&rsquo; he was all in a tremble, and dropped his hat for the
      second time &lsquo;but I&mdash;I&rsquo;m rather flurried, and I fear I&rsquo;ve wandered
      from the point.&rsquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;If you will come back to it, Thomas,&rsquo; said Mr Pecksniff, with an icy
      look, &lsquo;I shall feel obliged.&rsquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Yes, sir,&rsquo; returned Tom, &lsquo;certainly. They had a posting carriage at the
      porch, sir, and had stopped to hear the organ, they said. And then they
      said&mdash;<i>she </i>said, I mean, &ldquo;I believe you live with Mr Pecksniff, sir?&rdquo;
       I said I had that honour, and I took the liberty, sir,&rsquo; added Tom, raising
      his eyes to his benefactor&rsquo;s face, &lsquo;of saying, as I always will and must,
      with your permission, that I was under great obligations to you, and never
      could express my sense of them sufficiently.&rsquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;That,&rsquo; said Mr Pecksniff, &lsquo;was very, very wrong. Take your time, Mr
      Pinch.&rsquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Thank you, sir,&rsquo; cried Tom. &lsquo;On that they asked me&mdash;she asked, I
      mean&mdash;&ldquo;Wasn&rsquo;t there a bridle road to Mr Pecksniff&rsquo;s house?&rdquo;&rsquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      Mr Pecksniff suddenly became full of interest.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;&ldquo;Without going by the Dragon?&rdquo; When I said there was, and said how happy
      I should be to show it &lsquo;em, they sent the carriage on by the road, and
      came with me across the meadows. I left &lsquo;em at the turnstile to run
      forward and tell you they were coming, and they&rsquo;ll be here, sir, in&mdash;in
      less than a minute&rsquo;s time, I should say,&rsquo; added Tom, fetching his breath
      with difficulty.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Now, who,&rsquo; said Mr Pecksniff, pondering, &lsquo;who may these people be?&rsquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Bless my soul, sir!&rsquo; cried Tom, &lsquo;I meant to mention that at first, I
      thought I had. I knew them&mdash;her, I mean&mdash;directly. The gentleman
      who was ill at the Dragon, sir, last winter; and the young lady who
      attended him.&rsquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      Tom&rsquo;s teeth chattered in his head, and he positively staggered with
      amazement, at witnessing the extraordinary effect produced on Mr Pecksniff
      by these simple words. The dread of losing the old man&rsquo;s favour almost as
      soon as they were reconciled, through the mere fact of having Jonas in the
      house; the impossibility of dismissing Jonas, or shutting him up, or tying
      him hand and foot and putting him in the coal-cellar, without offending
      him beyond recall; the horrible discordance prevailing in the
      establishment, and the impossibility of reducing it to decent harmony with
      Charity in loud hysterics, Mercy in the utmost disorder, Jonas in the
      parlour, and Martin Chuzzlewit and his young charge upon the very
      doorsteps; the total hopelessness of being able to disguise or feasibly
      explain this state of rampant confusion; the sudden accumulation over his
      devoted head of every complicated perplexity and entanglement for his
      extrication from which he had trusted to time, good fortune, chance, and
      his own plotting, so filled the entrapped architect with dismay, that if
      Tom could have been a Gorgon staring at Mr Pecksniff, and Mr Pecksniff
      could have been a Gorgon staring at Tom, they could not have horrified
      each other half so much as in their own bewildered persons.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Dear, dear!&rsquo; cried Tom, &lsquo;what have I done? I hoped it would be a pleasant
      surprise, sir. I thought you would like to know.&rsquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      But at that moment a loud knocking was heard at the hall door.

      The knocking at Mr Pecksniff&rsquo;s door, though loud enough, bore no
      resemblance whatever to the noise of an American railway train at full
      speed. It may be well to begin the present chapter with this frank
      admission, lest the reader should imagine that the sounds now deafening
      this history&rsquo;s ears have any connection with the knocker on Mr Pecksniff&rsquo;s
      door, or with the great amount of agitation pretty equally divided between
      that worthy man and Mr Pinch, of which its strong performance was the
      cause.
    </p>
    <p>
      Mr Pecksniff&rsquo;s house is more than a thousand leagues away; and again this
      happy chronicle has Liberty and Moral Sensibility for its high companions.
      Again it breathes the blessed air of Independence; again it contemplates
      with pious awe that moral sense which renders unto Ceasar nothing that is
      his; again inhales that sacred atmosphere which was the life of him&mdash;oh
      noble patriot, with many followers!&mdash;who dreamed of Freedom in a
      slave&rsquo;s embrace, and waking sold her offspring and his own in public
      markets.
    </p>
    <p>
      How the wheels clank and rattle, and the tram-road shakes, as the train
      rushes on! And now the engine yells, as it were lashed and tortured like a
      living labourer, and writhed in agony. A poor fancy; for steel and iron
      are of infinitely greater account, in this commonwealth, than flesh and
      blood. If the cunning work of man be urged beyond its power of endurance,
      it has within it the elements of its own revenge; whereas the wretched
      mechanism of the Divine Hand is dangerous with no such property, but may
      be tampered with, and crushed, and broken, at the driver&rsquo;s pleasure. Look
      at that engine! It shall cost a man more dollars in the way of penalty and
      fine, and satisfaction of the outraged law, to deface in wantonness that
      senseless mass of metal, than to take the lives of twenty human creatures!
      Thus the stars wink upon the bloody stripes; and Liberty pulls down her
      cap upon her eyes, and owns Oppression in its vilest aspect, for her
      sister.
    </p>
    <p>
      The engine-driver of the train whose noise awoke us to the present chapter
      was certainly troubled with no such reflections as these; nor is it very
      probable that his mind was disturbed by any reflections at all. He leaned
      with folded arms and crossed legs against the side of the carriage,
      smoking; and, except when he expressed, by a grunt as short as his pipe,
      his approval of some particularly dexterous aim on the part of his
      colleague, the fireman, who beguiled his leisure by throwing logs of wood
      from the tender at the numerous stray cattle on the line, he preserved a
      composure so immovable, and an indifference so complete, that if the
      locomotive had been a sucking-pig, he could not have been more perfectly
      indifferent to its doings. Notwithstanding the tranquil state of this
      officer, and his unbroken peace of mind, the train was proceeding with
      tolerable rapidity; and the rails being but poorly laid, the jolts and
      bumps it met with in its progress were neither slight nor few.
    </p>
    <p>
      There were three great caravans or cars attached. The ladies&rsquo; car, the
      gentlemen&rsquo;s car, and the car for negroes; the latter painted black, as an
      appropriate compliment to its company. Martin and Mark Tapley were in the
      first, as it was the most comfortable; and, being far from full, received
      other gentlemen who, like them, were unblessed by the society of ladies of
      their own. They were seated side by side, and were engaged in earnest
      conversation.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;And so, Mark,&rsquo; said Martin, looking at him with an anxious expression,
      &lsquo;and so you are glad we have left New York far behind us, are you?&rsquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Yes, sir,&rsquo; said Mark. &lsquo;I am. Precious glad.&rsquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Were you not &ldquo;jolly&rdquo; there?&rsquo; asked Martin.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;On the contrairy, sir,&rsquo; returned Mark. &lsquo;The jolliest week as ever I spent
      in my life, was that there week at Pawkins&rsquo;s.&rsquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;What do you think of our prospects?&rsquo; inquired Martin, with an air that
      plainly said he had avoided the question for some time.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Uncommon bright, sir,&rsquo; returned Mark. &lsquo;Impossible for a place to have a
      better name, sir, than the Walley of Eden. No man couldn&rsquo;t think of
      settling in a better place than the Walley of Eden. And I&rsquo;m told,&rsquo; added
      Mark, after a pause, &lsquo;as there&rsquo;s lots of serpents there, so we shall come
      out, quite complete and reg&rsquo;lar.&rsquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      So far from dwelling upon this agreeable piece of information with the
      least dismay, Mark&rsquo;s face grew radiant as he called it to mind; so very
      radiant, that a stranger might have supposed he had all his life been
      yearning for the society of serpents, and now hailed with delight the
      approaching consummation of his fondest wishes.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Who told you that?&rsquo; asked Martin, sternly.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;A military officer,&rsquo; said Mark.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Confound you for a ridiculous fellow!&rsquo; cried Martin, laughing heartily in
      spite of himself. &lsquo;What military officer? You know they spring up in every
      field.&rsquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;As thick as scarecrows in England, sir,&rsquo; interposed Mark, &lsquo;which is a
      sort of milita themselves, being entirely coat and wescoat, with a stick
      inside. Ha, ha!&mdash;Don&rsquo;t mind me, sir; it&rsquo;s my way sometimes. I can&rsquo;t
      help being jolly. Why it was one of them inwading conquerors at Pawkins&rsquo;s,
      as told me. &ldquo;Am I rightly informed,&rdquo; he says&mdash;not exactly through his
      nose, but as if he&rsquo;d got a stoppage in it, very high up&mdash;&ldquo;that you&rsquo;re
      a-going to the Walley of Eden?&rdquo; &ldquo;I heard some talk on it,&rdquo; I told him.
      &ldquo;Oh!&rdquo; says he, &ldquo;if you should ever happen to go to bed there&mdash;you
      <i>may</i>, you know,&rdquo; he says, &ldquo;in course of time as civilisation progresses&mdash;don&rsquo;t
      forget to take a axe with you.&rdquo; I looks at him tolerable hard. &ldquo;Fleas?&rdquo;
       says I. &ldquo;And more,&rdquo; says he. &ldquo;Wampires?&rdquo; says I. &ldquo;And more,&rdquo; says he.
      &ldquo;Musquitoes, perhaps?&rdquo; says I. &ldquo;And more,&rdquo; says he. &ldquo;What more?&rdquo; says I.
      &ldquo;Snakes more,&rdquo; says he; &ldquo;rattle-snakes. You&rsquo;re right to a certain extent,
      stranger. There air some catawampous chawers in the small way too, as
      graze upon a human pretty strong; but don&rsquo;t mind <i>them</i>&mdash;they&rsquo;re
      company. It&rsquo;s snakes,&rdquo; he says, &ldquo;as you&rsquo;ll object to; and whenever you
      wake and see one in a upright poster on your bed,&rdquo; he says, &ldquo;like a
      corkscrew with the handle off a-sittin&rsquo; on its bottom ring, cut him down,
      for he means wenom.&rdquo;&rsquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Why didn&rsquo;t you tell me this before!&rsquo; cried Martin, with an expression of
      face which set off the cheerfulness of Mark&rsquo;s visage to great advantage.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;I never thought on it, sir,&rsquo; said Mark. &lsquo;It come in at one ear, and went
      out at the other. But Lord love us, he was one of another Company, I dare
      say, and only made up the story that we might go to his Eden, and not the
      opposition one.&rsquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;There&rsquo;s some probability in that,&rsquo; observed Martin. &lsquo;I can honestly say
      that I hope so, with all my heart.&rsquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;I&rsquo;ve not a doubt about it, sir,&rsquo; returned Mark, who, full of the
      inspiriting influence of the anecodote upon himself, had for the moment
      forgotten its probable effect upon his master; &lsquo;anyhow, we must live, you
      know, sir.&rsquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Live!&rsquo; cried Martin. &lsquo;Yes, it&rsquo;s easy to say live; but if we should happen
      not to wake when rattlesnakes are making corkscrews of themselves upon our
      beds, it may be not so easy to do it.&rsquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;And that&rsquo;s a fact,&rsquo; said a voice so close in his ear that it tickled him.
      &lsquo;That&rsquo;s dreadful true.&rsquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      Martin looked round, and found that a gentleman, on the seat behind, had
      thrust his head between himself and Mark, and sat with his chin resting on
      the back rail of their little bench, entertaining himself with their
      conversation. He was as languid and listless in his looks as most of the
      gentlemen they had seen; his cheeks were so hollow that he seemed to be
      always sucking them in; and the sun had burnt him, not a wholesome red or
      brown, but dirty yellow. He had bright dark eyes, which he kept half
      closed; only peeping out of the corners, and even then with a glance that
      seemed to say, &lsquo;Now you won&rsquo;t overreach me; you want to, but you won&rsquo;t.&rsquo;
      His arms rested carelessly on his knees as he leant forward; in the palm
      of his left hand, as English rustics have their slice of cheese, he had a
      cake of tobacco; in his right a penknife. He struck into the dialogue with
      as little reserve as if he had been specially called in, days before, to
      hear the arguments on both sides, and favour them with his opinion; and he
      no more contemplated or cared for the possibility of their not desiring
      the honour of his acquaintance or interference in their private affairs
      than if he had been a bear or a buffalo.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;That,&rsquo; he repeated, nodding condescendingly to Martin, as to an outer
      barbarian and foreigner, &lsquo;is dreadful true. Darn all manner of vermin.&rsquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      Martin could not help frowning for a moment, as if he were disposed to
      insinuate that the gentleman had unconsciously &lsquo;darned&rsquo; himself. But
      remembering the wisdom of doing at Rome as Romans do, he smiled with the
      pleasantest expression he could assume upon so short a notice.
    </p>
    <p>
      Their new friend said no more just then, being busily employed in cutting
      a quid or plug from his cake of tobacco, and whistling softly to himself
      the while. When he had shaped it to his liking, he took out his old plug,
      and deposited the same on the back of the seat between Mark and Martin,
      while he thrust the new one into the hollow of his cheek, where it looked
      like a large walnut, or tolerable pippin. Finding it quite satisfactory,
      he stuck the point of his knife into the old plug, and holding it out for
      their inspection, remarked with the air of a man who had not lived in
      vain, that it was &lsquo;used up considerable.&rsquo; Then he tossed it away; put his
      knife into one pocket and his tobacco into another; rested his chin upon
      the rail as before; and approving of the pattern on Martin&rsquo;s waistcoat,
      reached out his hand to feel the texture of that garment.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;What do you call this now?&rsquo; he asked.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Upon my word&rsquo; said Martin, &lsquo;I don&rsquo;t know what it&rsquo;s called.&rsquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;It&rsquo;ll cost a dollar or more a yard, I reckon?&rsquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;I really don&rsquo;t know.&rsquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;In my country,&rsquo; said the gentleman, &lsquo;we know the cost of our own
      pro-duce.&rsquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      Martin not discussing the question, there was a pause.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Well!&rsquo; resumed their new friend, after staring at them intently during
      the whole interval of silence; &lsquo;how&rsquo;s the unnat&rsquo;ral old parent by this
      time?&rsquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      Mr Tapley regarding this inquiry as only another version of the
      impertinent English question, &lsquo;How&rsquo;s your mother?&rsquo; would have resented it
      instantly, but for Martin&rsquo;s prompt interposition.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;You mean the old country?&rsquo; he said.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Ah!&rsquo; was the reply. &lsquo;How&rsquo;s she? Progressing back&rsquo;ards, I expect, as
      usual? Well! How&rsquo;s Queen Victoria?&rsquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;In good health, I believe,&rsquo; said Martin.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Queen Victoria won&rsquo;t shake in her royal shoes at all, when she hears
      to-morrow named,&rsquo; observed the stranger, &lsquo;No.&rsquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Not that I am aware of. Why should she?&rsquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;She won&rsquo;t be taken with a cold chill, when she realises what is being
      done in these diggings,&rsquo; said the stranger. &lsquo;No.&rsquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;No,&rsquo; said Martin. &lsquo;I think I could take my oath of that.&rsquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      The strange gentleman looked at him as if in pity for his ignorance or
      prejudice, and said:
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Well, sir, I tell you this&mdash;there ain&rsquo;t a engine with its biler
      bust, in God A&rsquo;mighty&rsquo;s free U-nited States, so fixed, and nipped, and
      frizzled to a most e-tarnal smash, as that young critter, in her luxurious
      location in the Tower of London will be, when she reads the next
      double-extra Watertoast Gazette.&rsquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      Several other gentlemen had left their seats and gathered round during the
      foregoing dialogue. They were highly delighted with this speech. One very
      lank gentleman, in a loose limp white cravat, long white waistcoat, and a
      black great-coat, who seemed to be in authority among them, felt called
      upon to acknowledge it.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Hem! Mr La Fayette Kettle,&rsquo; he said, taking off his hat.
    </p>
    <p>
      There was a grave murmur of &lsquo;Hush!&rsquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Mr La Fayette Kettle! Sir!&rsquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      Mr Kettle bowed.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;In the name of this company, sir, and in the name of our common country,
      and in the name of that righteous cause of holy sympathy in which we are
      engaged, I thank you. I thank you, sir, in the name of the Watertoast
      Sympathisers; and I thank you, sir, in the name of the Watertoast Gazette;
      and I thank you, sir, in the name of the star-spangled banner of the Great
      United States, for your eloquent and categorical exposition. And if, sir,&rsquo;
      said the speaker, poking Martin with the handle of his umbrella to bespeak
      his attention, for he was listening to a whisper from Mark; &lsquo;if, sir, in
      such a place, and at such a time, I might venture to con-clude with a
      sentiment, glancing&mdash;however slantin&rsquo;dicularly&mdash;at the subject
      in hand, I would say, sir, may the British Lion have his talons eradicated
      by the noble bill of the American Eagle, and be taught to play upon the
      Irish Harp and the Scotch Fiddle that music which is breathed in every
      empty shell that lies upon the shores of green Co-lumbia!&rsquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      Here the lank gentleman sat down again, amidst a great sensation; and
      every one looked very grave.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;General Choke,&rsquo; said Mr La Fayette Kettle, &lsquo;you warm my heart; sir, you
      warm my heart. But the British Lion is not unrepresented here, sir; and I
      should be glad to hear his answer to those remarks.&rsquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Upon my word,&rsquo; cried Martin, laughing, &lsquo;since you do me the honour to
      consider me his representative, I have only to say that I never heard of
      Queen Victoria reading the What&rsquo;s-his-name Gazette and that I should
      scarcely think it probable.&rsquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      General Choke smiled upon the rest, and said, in patient and benignant
      explanation:
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;It is sent to her, sir. It is sent to her. Her mail.&rsquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;But if it is addressed to the Tower of London, it would hardly come to
      hand, I fear,&rsquo; returned Martin; &lsquo;for she don&rsquo;t live there.&rsquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;The Queen of England, gentlemen,&rsquo; observed Mr Tapley, affecting the
      greatest politeness, and regarding them with an immovable face, &lsquo;usually
      lives in the Mint to take care of the money. She <i>has </i>lodgings, in virtue
      of her office, with the Lord Mayor at the Mansion House; but don&rsquo;t often
      occupy them, in consequence of the parlour chimney smoking.&rsquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Mark,&rsquo; said Martin, &lsquo;I shall be very much obliged to you if you&rsquo;ll have
      the goodness not to interfere with preposterous statements, however jocose
      they may appear to you. I was merely remarking gentlemen&mdash;though it&rsquo;s
      a point of very little import&mdash;that the Queen of England does not
      happen to live in the Tower of London.&rsquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;General!&rsquo; cried Mr La Fayette Kettle. &lsquo;You hear?&rsquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;General!&rsquo; echoed several others. &lsquo;General!&rsquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Hush! Pray, silence!&rsquo; said General Choke, holding up his hand, and
      speaking with a patient and complacent benevolence that was quite
      touching. &lsquo;I have always remarked it as a very extraordinary circumstance,
      which I impute to the natur&rsquo; of British Institutions and their tendency to
      suppress that popular inquiry and information which air so widely diffused
      even in the trackless forests of this vast Continent of the Western Ocean;
      that the knowledge of Britishers themselves on such points is not to be
      compared with that possessed by our intelligent and locomotive citizens.
      This is interesting, and confirms my observation. When you say, sir,&rsquo; he
      continued, addressing Martin, &lsquo;that your Queen does not reside in the
      Tower of London, you fall into an error, not uncommon to your countrymen,
      even when their abilities and moral elements air such as to command
      respect. But, sir, you air wrong. She <i>does </i>live there&mdash;&rsquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;When she is at the Court of Saint James&rsquo;s,&rsquo; interposed Kettle.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;When she is at the Court of Saint James&rsquo;s, of course,&rsquo; returned the
      General, in the same benignant way; &lsquo;for if her location was in Windsor
      Pavilion it couldn&rsquo;t be in London at the same time. Your Tower of London,
      sir,&rsquo; pursued the General, smiling with a mild consciousness of his
      knowledge, &lsquo;is nat&rsquo;rally your royal residence. Being located in the
      immediate neighbourhood of your Parks, your Drives, your Triumphant
      Arches, your Opera, and your Royal Almacks, it nat&rsquo;rally suggests itself
      as the place for holding a luxurious and thoughtless court. And,
      consequently,&rsquo; said the General, &lsquo;consequently, the court is held there.&rsquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Have you been in England?&rsquo; asked Martin.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;In print I have, sir,&rsquo; said the General, &lsquo;not otherwise. We air a reading
      people here, sir. You will meet with much information among us that will
      surprise you, sir.&rsquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;I have not the least doubt of it,&rsquo; returned Martin. But here he was
      interrupted by Mr La Fayette Kettle, who whispered in his ear:
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;You know General Choke?&rsquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;No,&rsquo; returned Martin, in the same tone.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;You know what he is considered?&rsquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;One of the most remarkable men in the country?&rsquo; said Martin, at a
      venture.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;That&rsquo;s a fact,&rsquo; rejoined Kettle. &lsquo;I was sure you must have heard of him!&rsquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;I think,&rsquo; said Martin, addressing himself to the General again, &lsquo;that I
      have the pleasure of being the bearer of a letter of introduction to you,
      sir. From Mr Bevan, of Massachusetts,&rsquo; he added, giving it to him.
    </p>
    <p>
      The General took it and read it attentively; now and then stopping to
      glance at the two strangers. When he had finished the note, he came over
      to Martin, sat down by him, and shook hands.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Well!&rsquo; he said, &lsquo;and you think of settling in Eden?&rsquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Subject to your opinion, and the agent&rsquo;s advice,&rsquo; replied Martin. &lsquo;I am
      told there is nothing to be done in the old towns.&rsquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;I can introduce you to the agent, sir,&rsquo; said the General. &lsquo;I know him. In
      fact, I am a member of the Eden Land Corporation myself.&rsquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      This was serious news to Martin, for his friend had laid great stress upon
      the General&rsquo;s having no connection, as he thought, with any land company,
      and therefore being likely to give him disinterested advice. The General
      explained that he had joined the Corporation only a few weeks ago, and
      that no communication had passed between himself and Mr Bevan since.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;We have very little to venture,&rsquo; said Martin anxiously&mdash;&lsquo;only a few
      pounds&mdash;but it is our all. Now, do you think that for one of my
      profession, this would be a speculation with any hope or chance in it?&rsquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Well,&rsquo; observed the General, gravely, &lsquo;if there wasn&rsquo;t any hope or chance
      in the speculation, it wouldn&rsquo;t have engaged my dollars, I opinionate.&rsquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;I don&rsquo;t mean for the sellers,&rsquo; said Martin. &lsquo;For the buyers&mdash;for the
      buyers!&rsquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;For the buyers, sir?&rsquo; observed the General, in a most impressive manner.
      &lsquo;Well! you come from an old country; from a country, sir, that has piled
      up golden calves as high as Babel, and worshipped &lsquo;em for ages. We are a
      new country, sir; man is in a more primeval state here, sir; we have not
      the excuse of having lapsed in the slow course of time into degenerate
      practices; we have no false gods; man, sir, here, is man in all his
      dignity. We fought for that or nothing. Here am I, sir,&rsquo; said the General,
      setting up his umbrella to represent himself, and a villanous-looking
      umbrella it was; a very bad counter to stand for the sterling coin of his
      benevolence, &lsquo;here am I with grey hairs sir, and a moral sense. Would I,
      with my principles, invest capital in this speculation if I didn&rsquo;t think
      it full of hopes and chances for my brother man?&rsquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      Martin tried to look convinced, but he thought of New York, and found it
      difficult.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;What are the Great United States for, sir,&rsquo; pursued the General &lsquo;if not
      for the regeneration of man? But it is nat&rsquo;ral in you to make such an
      enquerry, for you come from England, and you do not know my country.&rsquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Then you think,&rsquo; said Martin, &lsquo;that allowing for the hardships we are
      prepared to undergo, there is a reasonable&mdash;Heaven knows we don&rsquo;t
      expect much&mdash;a reasonable opening in this place?&rsquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;A reasonable opening in Eden, sir! But see the agent, see the agent; see
      the maps and plans, sir; and conclude to go or stay, according to the
      natur&rsquo; of the settlement. Eden hadn&rsquo;t need to go a-begging yet, sir,&rsquo;
      remarked the General.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;It is an awful lovely place, sure-ly. And frightful wholesome, likewise!&rsquo;
      said Mr Kettle, who had made himself a party to this conversation as a
      matter of course.
    </p>
    <p>
      Martin felt that to dispute such testimony, for no better reason than
      because he had his secret misgivings on the subject, would be
      ungentlemanly and indecent. So he thanked the General for his promise to
      put him in personal communication with the agent; and &lsquo;concluded&rsquo; to see
      that officer next morning. He then begged the General to inform him who
      the Watertoast Sympathisers were, of whom he had spoken in addressing Mr
      La Fayette Kettle, and on what grievances they bestowed their Sympathy. To
      which the General, looking very serious, made answer, that he might fully
      enlighten himself on those points to-morrow by attending a Great Meeting
      of the Body, which would then be held at the town to which they were
      travelling; &lsquo;over which, sir,&rsquo; said the General, &lsquo;my fellow-citizens have
      called on me to preside.&rsquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      They came to their journey&rsquo;s end late in the evening. Close to the railway
      was an immense white edifice, like an ugly hospital, on which was painted
      &lsquo;<i>National Hotel</i>.&rsquo; There was a wooden gallery or verandah in front, in
      which it was rather startling, when the train stopped, to behold a great
      many pairs of boots and shoes, and the smoke of a great many cigars, but
      no other evidences of human habitation. By slow degrees, however, some
      heads and shoulders appeared, and connecting themselves with the boots and
      shoes, led to the discovery that certain gentlemen boarders, who had a
      fancy for putting their heels where the gentlemen boarders in other
      countries usually put their heads, were enjoying themselves after their
      own manner in the cool of the evening.
    </p>
    <p>
      There was a great bar-room in this hotel, and a great public room in which
      the general table was being set out for supper. There were interminable
      whitewashed staircases, long whitewashed galleries upstairs and
      downstairs, scores of little whitewashed bedrooms, and a four-sided
      verandah to every story in the house, which formed a large brick square
      with an uncomfortable courtyard in the centre, where some clothes were
      drying. Here and there, some yawning gentlemen lounged up and down with
      their hands in their pockets; but within the house and without, wherever
      half a dozen people were collected together, there, in their looks, dress,
      morals, manners, habits, intellect, and conversation, were Mr Jefferson
      Brick, Colonel Diver, Major Pawkins, General Choke, and Mr La Fayette
      Kettle, over, and over, and over again. They did the same things; said the
      same things; judged all subjects by, and reduced all subjects to, the same
      standard. Observing how they lived, and how they were always in the
      enchanting company of each other, Martin even began to comprehend their
      being the social, cheerful, winning, airy men they were.
    </p>
    <p>
      At the sounding of a dismal gong, this pleasant company went trooping down
      from all parts of the house to the public room; while from the
      neighbouring stores other guests came flocking in, in shoals; for half the
      town, married folks as well as single, resided at the National Hotel. Tea,
      coffee, dried meats, tongue, ham, pickles, cake, toast, preserves, and
      bread and butter, were swallowed with the usual ravaging speed; and then,
      as before, the company dropped off by degrees, and lounged away to the
      desk, the counter, or the bar-room. The ladies had a smaller ordinary of
      their own, to which their husbands and brothers were admitted if they
      chose; and in all other respects they enjoyed themselves as at Pawkins&rsquo;s.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Now, Mark, my good fellow, said Martin, closing the door of his little
      chamber, &lsquo;we must hold a solemn council, for our fate is decided to-morrow
      morning. You are determined to invest these savings of yours in the common
      stock, are you?&rsquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;If I hadn&rsquo;t been determined to make that wentur, sir,&rsquo; answered Mr
      Tapley, &lsquo;I shouldn&rsquo;t have come.&rsquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;How much is there here, did you say&rsquo; asked Martin, holding up a little
      bag.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Thirty-seven pound ten and sixpence. The Savings&rsquo; Bank said so at least.
      I never counted it. But <i>they </i>know, bless you!&rsquo; said Mark, with a shake of
      the head expressive of his unbounded confidence in the wisdom and
      arithmetic of those Institutions.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;The money we brought with us,&rsquo; said Martin, &lsquo;is reduced to a few
      shillings less than eight pounds.&rsquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      Mr Tapley smiled, and looked all manner of ways, that he might not be
      supposed to attach any importance to this fact.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Upon the ring&mdash;<i>her </i>ring, Mark,&rsquo; said Martin, looking ruefully at his
      empty finger&mdash;
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Ah!&rsquo; sighed Mr Tapley. &lsquo;Beg your pardon, sir.&rsquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;&mdash;We raised, in English money, fourteen pounds. So, even with that,
      your share of the stock is still very much the larger of the two you see.
      Now, Mark,&rsquo; said Martin, in his old way, just as he might have spoken to
      Tom Pinch, &lsquo;I have thought of a means of making this up to you&mdash;more
      than making it up to you, I hope&mdash;and very materially elevating your
      prospects in life.&rsquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Oh! don&rsquo;t talk of that, you know, sir,&rsquo; returned Mark. &lsquo;I don&rsquo;t want no
      elevating, sir. I&rsquo;m all right enough, sir, I am.&rsquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;No, but hear me,&rsquo; said Martin, &lsquo;because this is very important to you,
      and a great satisfaction to me. Mark, you shall be a partner in the
      business; an equal partner with myself. I will put in, as my additional
      capital, my professional knowledge and ability; and half the annual
      profits, as long as it is carried on, shall be yours.&rsquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      Poor Martin! For ever building castles in the air. For ever, in his very
      selfishness, forgetful of all but his own teeming hopes and sanguine
      plans. Swelling, at that instant, with the consciousness of patronizing
      and most munificently rewarding Mark!
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;I don&rsquo;t know, sir,&rsquo; Mark rejoined, much more sadly than his custom was,
      though from a very different cause than Martin supposed, &lsquo;what I can say
      to this, in the way of thanking you. I&rsquo;ll stand by you, sir, to the best
      of my ability, and to the last. That&rsquo;s all.&rsquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;We quite understand each other, my good fellow,&rsquo; said Martin rising in
      self-approval and condescension. &lsquo;We are no longer master and servant, but
      friends and partners; and are mutually gratified. If we determine on Eden,
      the business shall be commenced as soon as we get there. Under the name,&rsquo;
      said Martin, who never hammered upon an idea that wasn&rsquo;t red hot, &lsquo;under
      the name of Chuzzlewit and Tapley.&rsquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Lord love you, sir,&rsquo; cried Mark, &lsquo;don&rsquo;t have my name in it. I ain&rsquo;t
      acquainted with the business, sir. I must be Co., I must. I&rsquo;ve often
      thought,&rsquo; he added, in a low voice, &lsquo;as I should like to know a Co.; but I
      little thought as ever I should live to be one.&rsquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;You shall have your own way, Mark.&rsquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Thank&rsquo;ee, sir. If any country gentleman thereabouts, in the public way,
      or otherwise, wanted such a thing as a skittle-ground made, I could take
      that part of the bis&rsquo;ness, sir.&rsquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Against any architect in the States,&rsquo; said Martin. &lsquo;Get a couple of
      sherry-cobblers, Mark, and we&rsquo;ll drink success to the firm.&rsquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      Either he forgot already (and often afterwards), that they were no longer
      master and servant, or considered this kind of duty to be among the
      legitimate functions of the Co. But Mark obeyed with his usual alacrity;
      and before they parted for the night, it was agreed between them that they
      should go together to the agent&rsquo;s in the morning, but that Martin should
      decide the Eden question, on his own sound judgment. And Mark made no
      merit, even to himself in his jollity, of this concession; perfectly well
      knowing that the matter would come to that in the end, any way.
    </p>
    <p>
      The General was one of the party at the public table next day, and after
      breakfast suggested that they should wait upon the agent without loss of
      time. They, desiring nothing more, agreed; so off they all four started
      for the office of the Eden Settlement, which was almost within rifle-shot
      of the National Hotel.
    </p>
    <p>
      It was a small place&mdash;something like a turnpike. But a great deal of
      land may be got into a dice-box, and why may not a whole territory be
      bargained for in a shed? It was but a temporary office too; for the
      Edeners were &lsquo;going&rsquo; to build a superb establishment for the transaction
      of their business, and had already got so far as to mark out the site.
      Which is a great way in America. The office-door was wide open, and in the
      doorway was the agent; no doubt a tremendous fellow to get through his
      work, for he seemed to have no arrears, but was swinging backwards and
      forwards in a rocking-chair, with one of his legs planted high up against
      the door-post, and the other doubled up under him, as if he were hatching
      his foot.
    </p>
    <p>
      He was a gaunt man in a huge straw hat, and a coat of green stuff. The
      weather being hot, he had no cravat, and wore his shirt collar wide open;
      so that every time he spoke something was seen to twitch and jerk up in
      his throat, like the little hammers in a harpsichord when the notes are
      struck. Perhaps it was the Truth feebly endeavouring to leap to his lips.
      If so, it never reached them.
    </p>
    <p>
      Two grey eyes lurked deep within this agent&rsquo;s head, but one of them had no
      sight in it, and stood stock still. With that side of his face he seemed
      to listen to what the other side was doing. Thus each profile had a
      distinct expression; and when the movable side was most in action, the
      rigid one was in its coldest state of watchfulness. It was like turning
      the man inside out, to pass to that view of his features in his liveliest
      mood, and see how calculating and intent they were.
    </p>
    <p>
      Each long black hair upon his head hung down as straight as any plummet
      line; but rumpled tufts were on the arches of his eyes, as if the crow
      whose foot was deeply printed in the corners had pecked and torn them in a
      savage recognition of his kindred nature as a bird of prey.
    </p>
    <p>
      Such was the man whom they now approached, and whom the General saluted by
      the name of Scadder.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Well, Gen&rsquo;ral,&rsquo; he returned, &lsquo;and how are you?&rsquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Ac-tive and spry, sir, in my country&rsquo;s service and the sympathetic cause.
      Two gentlemen on business, Mr Scadder.&rsquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      He shook hands with each of them&mdash;nothing is done in America without
      shaking hands&mdash;then went on rocking.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;I think I know what bis&rsquo;ness you have brought these strangers here upon,
      then, Gen&rsquo;ral?&rsquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Well, sir. I expect you may.&rsquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;You air a tongue-y person, Gen&rsquo;ral. For you talk too much, and that&rsquo;s
      fact,&rsquo; said Scadder. &lsquo;You speak a-larming well in public, but you didn&rsquo;t
      ought to go ahead so fast in private. Now!&rsquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;If I can realise your meaning, ride me on a rail!&rsquo; returned the General,
      after pausing for consideration.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;You know we didn&rsquo;t wish to sell the lots off right away to any loafer as
      might bid,&rsquo; said Scadder; &lsquo;but had con-cluded to reserve &lsquo;em for
      Aristocrats of Natur&rsquo;. Yes!&rsquo;
    </p>
<div class="fig" style="width:65%">
      <img src="images/20382m.jpg" alt="20382m " width="100%" /><br />
    </div>
    <h5>
      <a href="images/20382.jpg"><i>Original</i></a>
    </h5>
    <p>
      &lsquo;And they are here, sir!&rsquo; cried the General with warmth. &lsquo;They are here,
      sir!&rsquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;If they air here,&rsquo; returned the agent, in reproachful accents, &lsquo;that&rsquo;s
      enough. But you didn&rsquo;t ought to have your dander ris with <i>me</i>, Gen&rsquo;ral.&rsquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      The General whispered Martin that Scadder was the honestest fellow in the
      world, and that he wouldn&rsquo;t have given him offence designedly, for ten
      thousand dollars.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;I do my duty; and I raise the dander of my feller critters, as I wish to
      serve,&rsquo; said Scadder in a low voice, looking down the road and rocking
      still. &lsquo;They rile up rough, along of my objecting to their selling Eden
      off too cheap. That&rsquo;s human natur&rsquo;! Well!&rsquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Mr Scadder,&rsquo; said the General, assuming his oratorical deportment. &lsquo;Sir!
      Here is my hand, and here my heart. I esteem you, sir, and ask your
      pardon. These gentlemen air friends of mine, or I would not have brought
      &lsquo;em here, sir, being well aware, sir, that the lots at present go entirely
      too cheap. But these air friends, sir; these air partick&rsquo;ler friends.&rsquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      Mr Scadder was so satisfied by this explanation, that he shook the General
      warmly by the hand, and got out of the rocking-chair to do it. He then
      invited the General&rsquo;s particular friends to accompany him into the office.
      As to the General, he observed, with his usual benevolence, that being one
      of the company, he wouldn&rsquo;t interfere in the transaction on any account;
      so he appropriated the rocking-chair to himself, and looked at the
      prospect, like a good Samaritan waiting for a traveller.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Heyday!&rsquo; cried Martin, as his eye rested on a great plan which occupied
      one whole side of the office. Indeed, the office had little else in it,
      but some geological and botanical specimens, one or two rusty ledgers, a
      homely desk, and a stool. &lsquo;Heyday! what&rsquo;s that?&rsquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;That&rsquo;s Eden,&rsquo; said Scadder, picking his teeth with a sort of young
      bayonet that flew out of his knife when he touched a spring.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Why, I had no idea it was a city.&rsquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Hadn&rsquo;t you? Oh, it&rsquo;s a city.&rsquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      A flourishing city, too! An architectural city! There were banks,
      churches, cathedrals, market-places, factories, hotels, stores, mansions,
      wharves; an exchange, a theatre; public buildings of all kinds, down to
      the office of the Eden Stinger, a daily journal; all faithfully depicted
      in the view before them.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Dear me! It&rsquo;s really a most important place!&rsquo; cried Martin turning round.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Oh! it&rsquo;s very important,&rsquo; observed the agent.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;But, I am afraid,&rsquo; said Martin, glancing again at the Public Buildings,
      &lsquo;that there&rsquo;s nothing left for me to do.&rsquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Well! it ain&rsquo;t all built,&rsquo; replied the agent. &lsquo;Not quite.&rsquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      This was a great relief.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;The market-place, now,&rsquo; said Martin. &lsquo;Is that built?&rsquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;That?&rsquo; said the agent, sticking his toothpick into the weathercock on the
      top. &lsquo;Let me see. No; that ain&rsquo;t built.&rsquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Rather a good job to begin with&mdash;eh, Mark?&rsquo; whispered Martin nudging
      him with his elbow.
    </p>
    <p>
      Mark, who, with a very stolid countenance had been eyeing the plan and the
      agent by turns, merely rejoined &lsquo;Uncommon!&rsquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      A dead silence ensued, Mr Scadder in some short recesses or vacations of
      his toothpick, whistled a few bars of Yankee Doodle, and blew the dust off
      the roof of the Theatre.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;I suppose,&rsquo; said Martin, feigning to look more narrowly at the plan, but
      showing by his tremulous voice how much depended, in his mind, upon the
      answer; &lsquo;I suppose there are&mdash;several architects there?&rsquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;There ain&rsquo;t a single one,&rsquo; said Scadder.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Mark,&rsquo; whispered Martin, pulling him by the sleeve, &lsquo;do you hear that?
      But whose work is all this before us, then?&rsquo; he asked aloud.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;The soil being very fruitful, public buildings grows spontaneous,
      perhaps,&rsquo; said Mark.
    </p>
    <p>
      He was on the agent&rsquo;s dark side as he said it; but Scadder instantly
      changed his place, and brought his active eye to bear upon him.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Feel of my hands, young man,&rsquo; he said.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;What for?&rsquo; asked Mark, declining.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Air they dirty, or air they clean, sir?&rsquo; said Scadder, holding them out.
    </p>
    <p>
      In a physical point of view they were decidedly dirty. But it being
      obvious that Mr Scadder offered them for examination in a figurative
      sense, as emblems of his moral character, Martin hastened to pronounce
      them pure as the driven snow.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;I entreat, Mark,&rsquo; he said, with some irritation, &lsquo;that you will not
      obtrude remarks of that nature, which, however harmless and
      well-intentioned, are quite out of place, and cannot be expected to be
      very agreeable to strangers. I am quite surprised.&rsquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;The Co.&lsquo;s a-putting his foot in it already,&rsquo; thought Mark. &lsquo;He must be a
      sleeping partner&mdash;fast asleep and snoring&mdash;Co. must; I see.&rsquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      Mr Scadder said nothing, but he set his back against the plan, and thrust
      his toothpick into the desk some twenty times; looking at Mark all the
      while as if he were stabbing him in effigy.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;You haven&rsquo;t said whose work it is,&rsquo; Martin ventured to observe at length,
      in a tone of mild propitiation.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Well, never mind whose work it is, or isn&rsquo;t,&rsquo; said the agent sulkily. &lsquo;No
      matter how it did eventuate. P&rsquo;raps he cleared off, handsome, with a heap
      of dollars; p&rsquo;raps he wasn&rsquo;t worth a cent. P&rsquo;raps he was a loafin&rsquo; rowdy;
      p&rsquo;raps a ring-tailed roarer. Now!&rsquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;All your doing, Mark!&rsquo; said Martin.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;P&rsquo;raps,&rsquo; pursued the agent, &lsquo;them ain&rsquo;t plants of Eden&rsquo;s raising. No!
      P&rsquo;raps that desk and stool ain&rsquo;t made from Eden lumber. No! P&rsquo;raps no end
      of squatters ain&rsquo;t gone out there. No! P&rsquo;raps there ain&rsquo;t no such location
      in the territoary of the Great U-nited States. Oh, no!&rsquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;I hope you&rsquo;re satisfied with the success of your joke, Mark,&rsquo; said
      Martin.
    </p>
    <p>
      But here, at a most opportune and happy time, the General interposed, and
      called out to Scadder from the doorway to give his friends the particulars
      of that little lot of fifty acres with the house upon it; which, having
      belonged to the company formerly, had lately lapsed again into their
      hands.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;You air a deal too open-handed, Gen&rsquo;ral,&rsquo; was the answer. &lsquo;It is a lot as
      should be rose in price. It is.&rsquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      He grumblingly opened his books notwithstanding, and always keeping his
      bright side towards Mark, no matter at what amount of inconvenience to
      himself, displayed a certain leaf for their perusal. Martin read it
      greedily, and then inquired:
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Now where upon the plan may this place be?&rsquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Upon the plan?&rsquo; said Scadder.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Yes.&rsquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      He turned towards it, and reflected for a short time, as if, having been
      put upon his mettle, he was resolved to be particular to the very minutest
      hair&rsquo;s breadth of a shade. At length, after wheeling his toothpick slowly
      round and round in the air, as if it were a carrier pigeon just thrown up,
      he suddenly made a dart at the drawing, and pierced the very centre of the
      main wharf, through and through.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;There!&rsquo; he said, leaving his knife quivering in the wall; &lsquo;that&rsquo;s where
      it is!&rsquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      Martin glanced with sparkling eyes upon his Co., and his Co. saw that the
      thing was done.
    </p>
    <p>
      The bargain was not concluded as easily as might have been expected
      though, for Scadder was caustic and ill-humoured, and cast much
      unnecessary opposition in the way; at one time requesting them to think of
      it, and call again in a week or a fortnight; at another, predicting that
      they wouldn&rsquo;t like it; at another, offering to retract and let them off,
      and muttering strong imprecations upon the folly of the General. But the
      whole of the astoundingly small sum total of purchase-money&mdash;it was
      only one hundred and fifty dollars, or something more than thirty pounds
      of the capital brought by Co. into the architectural concern&mdash;was
      ultimately paid down; and Martin&rsquo;s head was two inches nearer the roof of
      the little wooden office, with the consciousness of being a landed
      proprietor in the thriving city of Eden.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;If it shouldn&rsquo;t happen to fit,&rsquo; said Scadder, as he gave Martin the
      necessary credentials on recepit of his money, &lsquo;don&rsquo;t blame me.&rsquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;No, no,&rsquo; he replied merrily. &lsquo;We&rsquo;ll not blame you. General, are you
      going?&rsquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;I am at your service, sir; and I wish you,&rsquo; said the General, giving him
      his hand with grave cordiality, &lsquo;joy of your po-ssession. You air now,
      sir, a denizen of the most powerful and highly-civilised dominion that has
      ever graced the world; a do-minion, sir, where man is bound to man in one
      vast bond of equal love and truth. May you, sir, be worthy of your
      a-dopted country!&rsquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      Martin thanked him, and took leave of Mr Scadder; who had resumed his post
      in the rocking-chair, immediately on the General&rsquo;s rising from it, and was
      once more swinging away as if he had never been disturbed. Mark looked
      back several times as they went down the road towards the National Hotel,
      but now his blighted profile was towards them, and nothing but attentive
      thoughtfulness was written on it. Strangely different to the other side!
      He was not a man much given to laughing, and never laughed outright; but
      every line in the print of the crow&rsquo;s foot, and every little wiry vein in
      that division of his head, was wrinkled up into a grin! The compound
      figure of Death and the Lady at the top of the old ballad was not divided
      with a greater nicety, and hadn&rsquo;t halves more monstrously unlike each
      other, than the two profiles of Zephaniah Scadder.
    </p>
    <p>
      The General posted along at a great rate, for the clock was on the stroke
      of twelve; and at that hour precisely, the Great Meeting of the Watertoast
      Sympathisers was to be holden in the public room of the National Hotel.
      Being very curious to witness the demonstration, and know what it was all
      about, Martin kept close to the General; and, keeping closer than ever
      when they entered the Hall, got by that means upon a little platform of
      tables at the upper end; where an armchair was set for the General, and Mr
      La Fayette Kettle, as secretary, was making a great display of some
      foolscap documents. Screamers, no doubt.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Well, sir!&rsquo; he said, as he shook hands with Martin, &lsquo;here is a spectacle
      calc&rsquo;lated to make the British Lion put his tail between his legs, and
      howl with anguish, I expect!&rsquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      Martin certainly thought it possible that the British Lion might have been
      rather out of his element in that Ark; but he kept the idea to himself.
      The General was then voted to the chair, on the motion of a pallid lad of
      the Jefferson Brick school; who forthwith set in for a high-spiced speech,
      with a good deal about hearths and homes in it, and unriveting the chains
      of Tyranny.
    </p>
    <p>
      Oh but it was a clincher for the British Lion, it was! The indignation of
      the glowing young Columbian knew no bounds. If he could only have been one
      of his own forefathers, he said, wouldn&rsquo;t he have peppered that same Lion,
      and been to him as another Brute Tamer with a wire whip, teaching him
      lessons not easily forgotten. &lsquo;Lion! (cried that young Columbian) where is
      he? Who is he? What is he? Show him to me. Let me have him here. Here!&rsquo;
      said the young Columbian, in a wrestling attitude, &lsquo;upon this sacred
      altar. Here!&rsquo; cried the young Columbian, idealising the dining-table,
      &lsquo;upon ancestral ashes, cemented with the glorious blood poured out like
      water on our native plains of Chickabiddy Lick! Bring forth that Lion!&rsquo;
      said the young Columbian. &lsquo;Alone, I dare him! I taunt that Lion. I tell
      that Lion, that Freedom&rsquo;s hand once twisted in his mane, he rolls a corse
      before me, and the Eagles of the Great Republic laugh ha, ha!&rsquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      When it was found that the Lion didn&rsquo;t come, but kept out of the way; that
      the young Columbian stood there, with folded arms, alone in his glory; and
      consequently that the Eagles were no doubt laughing wildly on the mountain
      tops; such cheers arose as might have shaken the hands upon the
      Horse-Guards&rsquo; clock, and changed the very mean time of the day in
      England&rsquo;s capital.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Who is this?&rsquo; Martin telegraphed to La Fayette.
    </p>
    <p>
      The Secretary wrote something, very gravely, on a piece of paper, twisted
      it up, and had it passed to him from hand to hand. It was an improvement
      on the old sentiment: &lsquo;Perhaps as remarkable a man as any in our country.&rsquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      This young Columbian was succeeded by another, to the full as eloquent as
      he, who drew down storms of cheers. But both remarkable youths, in their
      great excitement (for your true poetry can never stoop to details), forgot
      to say with whom or what the Watertoasters sympathized, and likewise why
      or wherefore they were sympathetic. Thus Martin remained for a long time
      as completely in the dark as ever; until at length a ray of light broke in
      upon him through the medium of the Secretary, who, by reading the minutes
      of their past proceedings, made the matter somewhat clearer. He then
      learned that the Watertoast Association sympathized with a certain Public
      Man in Ireland, who held a contest upon certain points with England; and
      that they did so, because they didn&rsquo;t love England at all&mdash;not by any
      means because they loved Ireland much; being indeed horribly jealous and
      distrustful of its people always, and only tolerating them because of
      their working hard, which made them very useful; labour being held in
      greater indignity in the simple republic than in any other country upon
      earth. This rendered Martin curious to see what grounds of sympathy the
      Watertoast Association put forth; nor was he long in suspense, for the
      General rose to read a letter to the Public Man, which with his own hands
      he had written.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Thus,&rsquo; said the General, &lsquo;thus, my friends and fellow-citizens, it runs:
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;&ldquo;<i>Sir</i>&mdash;I address you on behalf of the Watertoast Association of
      United Sympathisers. It is founded, sir, in the great republic of America!
      and now holds its breath, and swells the blue veins in its forehead nigh
      to bursting, as it watches, sir, with feverish intensity and sympathetic
      ardour, your noble efforts in the cause of Freedom.&rdquo;&rsquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      At the name of Freedom, and at every repetition of that name, all the
      Sympathisers roared aloud; cheering with nine times nine, and nine times
      over.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;&ldquo;In Freedom&rsquo;s name, sir&mdash;holy Freedom&mdash;I address you. In
      Freedom&rsquo;s name, I send herewith a contribution to the funds of your
      society. In Freedom&rsquo;s name, sir, I advert with indignation and disgust to
      that accursed animal, with gore-stained whiskers, whose rampant cruelty
      and fiery lust have ever been a scourge, a torment to the world. The naked
      visitors to Crusoe&rsquo;s Island, sir; the flying wives of Peter Wilkins; the
      fruit-smeared children of the tangled bush; nay, even the men of large
      stature, anciently bred in the mining districts of Cornwall; alike bear
      witness to its savage nature. Where, sir, are the Cormorans, the
      Blunderbores, the Great Feefofums, named in History? All, all,
      exterminated by its destroying hand.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;&ldquo;I allude, sir, to the British Lion.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;&ldquo;Devoted, mind and body, heart and soul, to Freedom, sir&mdash;to
      Freedom, blessed solace to the snail upon the cellar-door, the oyster in
      his pearly bed, the still mite in his home of cheese, the very winkle of
      your country in his shelly lair&mdash;in her unsullied name, we offer you
      our sympathy. Oh, sir, in this our cherished and our happy land, her fires
      burn bright and clear and smokeless; once lighted up in yours, the lion
      shall be roasted whole.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;&ldquo;I am, sir, in Freedom&rsquo;s name,
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;&ldquo;Your affectionate friend and faithful Sympathiser,
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;&ldquo;CYRUS CHOKE,
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;&ldquo;General, U.S.M.&rdquo;&rsquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      It happened that just as the General began to read this letter, the
      railroad train arrived, bringing a new mail from England; and a packet had
      been handed in to the Secretary, which during its perusal and the frequent
      cheerings in homage to freedom, he had opened. Now, its contents disturbed
      him very much, and the moment the General sat down, he hurried to his
      side, and placed in his hand a letter and several printed extracts from
      English newspapers; to which, in a state of infinite excitement, he called
      his immediate attention.
    </p>
    <p>
      The General, being greatly heated by his own composition, was in a fit
      state to receive any inflammable influence; but he had no sooner possessed
      himself of the contents of these documents, than a change came over his
      face, involving such a huge amount of choler and passion, that the noisy
      concourse were silent in a moment, in very wonder at the sight of him.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;My friends!&rsquo; cried the General, rising; &lsquo;my friends and fellow citizens,
      we have been mistaken in this man.&rsquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;In what man?&rsquo; was the cry.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;In this,&rsquo; panted the General, holding up the letter he had read aloud a
      few minutes before. &lsquo;I find that he has been, and is, the advocate&mdash;consistent
      in it always too&mdash;of Nigger emancipation!&rsquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      If anything beneath the sky be real, those Sons of Freedom would have
      pistolled, stabbed&mdash;in some way slain&mdash;that man by coward hands
      and murderous violence, if he had stood among them at that time. The most
      confiding of their own countrymen would not have wagered then&mdash;no,
      nor would they ever peril&mdash;one dunghill straw, upon the life of any
      man in such a strait. They tore the letter, cast the fragments in the air,
      trod down the pieces as they fell; and yelled, and groaned, and hissed,
      till they could cry no longer.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;I shall move,&rsquo; said the General, when he could make himself heard, &lsquo;that
      the Watertoast Association of United Sympathisers be immediately
      dissolved!&rsquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      Down with it! Away with it! Don&rsquo;t hear of it! Burn its records! Pull the
      room down! Blot it out of human memory!
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;But, my fellow-countrymen!&rsquo; said the General, &lsquo;the contributions. We have
      funds. What is to be done with the funds?&rsquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      It was hastily resolved that a piece of plate should be presented to a
      certain constitutional Judge, who had laid down from the Bench the noble
      principle that it was lawful for any white mob to murder any black man;
      and that another piece of plate, of similar value should be presented to a
      certain Patriot, who had declared from his high place in the Legislature,
      that he and his friends would hang without trial, any Abolitionist who
      might pay them a visit. For the surplus, it was agreed that it should be
      devoted to aiding the enforcement of those free and equal laws, which
      render it incalculably more criminal and dangerous to teach a negro to
      read and write than to roast him alive in a public city. These points
      adjusted, the meeting broke up in great disorder, and there was an end of
      the Watertoast Sympathy.
    </p>
    <p>
      As Martin ascended to his bedroom, his eye was attracted by the Republican
      banner, which had been hoisted from the house-top in honour of the
      occasion, and was fluttering before a window which he passed.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Tut!&rsquo; said Martin. &lsquo;You&rsquo;re a gay flag in the distance. But let a man be
      near enough to get the light upon the other side and see through you; and
      you are but sorry fustian!&rsquo;

    <h2>
      CHAPTER TWENTY-TWO
    </h2>
    <p>
      FROM WHICH IT WILL BE SEEN THAT MARTIN BECAME A LION OF HIS OWN ACCOUNT.
      TOGETHER WITH THE REASON WHY
    </p>
    <p>
      As soon as it was generally known in the National Hotel, that the young
      Englishman, Mr Chuzzlewit, had purchased a &lsquo;lo-cation&rsquo; in the Valley of
      Eden, and intended to betake himself to that earthly Paradise by the next
      steamboat, he became a popular character. Why this should be, or how it
      had come to pass, Martin no more knew than Mrs Gamp, of Kingsgate Street,
      High Holborn, did; but that he was for the time being the lion, by popular
      election, of the Watertoast community, and that his society was in rather
      inconvenient request there could be no kind of doubt.
    </p>
    <p>
      The first notification he received of this change in his position, was the
      following epistle, written in a thin running hand&mdash;with here and
      there a fat letter or two, to make the general effect more striking&mdash;on
      a sheet of paper, ruled with blue lines.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;<i>NATIONAL HOTEL, &lsquo;MONDAY MORNING</i>.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Dear Sir&mdash;&lsquo;When I had the privillidge of being your fellow-traveller
      in the cars, the day before yesterday, you offered some remarks upon the
      subject of the tower of London, which (in common with my fellow-citizens
      generally) I could wish to hear repeated to a public audience.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;As secretary to the Young Men&rsquo;s Watertoast Association of this town, I am
      requested to inform you that the Society will be proud to hear you deliver
      a lecture upon the Tower of London, at their Hall to-morrow evening, at
      seven o&rsquo;clock; and as a large issue of quarter-dollar tickets may be
      expected, your answer and consent by bearer will be considered obliging.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Dear Sir,
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Yours truly,
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;<i>LA FAYETTE KETTLE</i>.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;The Honourable M. Chuzzlewit.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;P.S.&mdash;The Society would not be particular in limiting you to the
      Tower of London. Permit me to suggest that any remarks upon the Elements
      of Geology, or (if more convenient) upon the Writings of your talented and
      witty countryman, the honourable Mr Miller, would be well received.&rsquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      Very much aghast at this invitation, Martin wrote back, civilly declining
      it; and had scarcely done so, when he received another letter.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;No. 47, Bunker Hill Street,
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Monday Morning.

    <p>

    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Sir&mdash;I was raised in those interminable solitudes where our mighty
      Mississippi (or Father of Waters) rolls his turbid flood.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;I am young, and ardent. For there is a poetry in wildness, and every
      alligator basking in the slime is in himself an Epic, self-contained. I
      aspirate for fame. It is my yearning and my thirst.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Are you, sir, aware of any member of Congress in England, who would
      undertake to pay my expenses to that country, and for six months after my
      arrival?
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;There is something within me which gives me the assurance that this
      enlightened patronage would not be thrown away. In literature or art; the
      bar, the pulpit, or the stage; in one or other, if not all, I feel that I
      am certain to succeed.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;If too much engaged to write to any such yourself, please let me have a
      list of three or four of those most likely to respond, and I will address
      them through the Post Office. May I also ask you to favour me with any
      critical observations that have ever presented themselves to your
      reflective faculties, on &ldquo;Cain, a Mystery,&rdquo; by the Right Honourable Lord
      Byron?
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;I am, Sir,
    </p>

      Floby, Dry Goods Store, as above.&rsquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      Both of which letters, together with Martin&rsquo;s reply to each, were,
      according to a laudable custom, much tending to the promotion of
      gentlemanly feeling and social confidence, published in the next number of
      the Watertoast Gazette.
    </p>
    <p>
      He had scarcely got through this correspondence when Captain Kedgick, the
      landlord, kindly came upstairs to see how he was getting on. The Captain
      sat down upon the bed before he spoke; and finding it rather hard, moved
      to the pillow.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Well, sir!&rsquo; said the Captain, putting his hat a little more on one side,
      for it was rather tight in the crown: &lsquo;You&rsquo;re quite a public man I
      calc&rsquo;late.&rsquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;So it seems,&rsquo; retorted Martin, who was very tired.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Our citizens, sir,&rsquo; pursued the Captain, &lsquo;intend to pay their respects to
      you. You will have to hold a sort of le-vee, sir, while you&rsquo;re here.&rsquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Powers above!&rsquo; cried Martin, &lsquo;I couldn&rsquo;t do that, my good fellow!&rsquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;I reckon you <i>must </i>then,&rsquo; said the Captain.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Must is not a pleasant word, Captain,&rsquo; urged Martin.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Well! I didn&rsquo;t fix the mother language, and I can&rsquo;t unfix it,&rsquo; said the
      Captain coolly; &lsquo;else I&rsquo;d make it pleasant. You must re-ceive. That&rsquo;s
      all.&rsquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;But why should I receive people who care as much for me as I care for
      them?&rsquo; asked Martin.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Well! because I have had a muniment put up in the bar,&rsquo; returned the
      Captain.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;A what?&rsquo; cried Martin.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;A muniment,&rsquo; rejoined the Captain.
    </p>
    <p>
      Martin looked despairingly at Mark, who informed him that the Captain
      meant a written notice that Mr Chuzzlewit would receive the Watertoasters
      that day, at and after two o&rsquo;clock which was in effect then hanging in the
      bar, as Mark, from ocular inspection of the same, could testify.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;You wouldn&rsquo;t be unpop&rsquo;lar, I know,&rsquo; said the Captain, paring his nails.
      &lsquo;Our citizens an&rsquo;t long of riling up, I tell you; and our Gazette could
      flay you like a wild cat.&rsquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      Martin was going to be very wroth, but he thought better of it, and said:
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;In Heaven&rsquo;s name let them come, then.&rsquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Oh, <i>they&rsquo;ll</i> come,&rsquo; returned the Captain. &lsquo;I have seen the big room fixed
      a&rsquo;purpose, with my eyes.&rsquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;But will you,&rsquo; said Martin, seeing that the Captain was about to go;
      &lsquo;will you at least tell me this? What do they want to see me for? what
      have I done? and how do they happen to have such a sudden interest in me?&rsquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      Captain Kedgick put a thumb and three fingers to each side of the brim of
      his hat; lifted it a little way off his head; put it on again carefully;
      passed one hand all down his face, beginning at the forehead and ending at
      the chin; looked at Martin; then at Mark; then at Martin again; winked,
      and walked out.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Upon my life, now!&rsquo; said Martin, bringing his hand heavily upon the
      table; &lsquo;such a perfectly unaccountable fellow as that, I never saw. Mark,
      what do you say to this?&rsquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Why, sir,&rsquo; returned his partner, &lsquo;my opinion is that we must have got to
      the <i>most </i>remarkable man in the country at last. So I hope there&rsquo;s an end
      to the breed, sir.&rsquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      Although this made Martin laugh, it couldn&rsquo;t keep off two o&rsquo;clock.
      Punctually, as the hour struck, Captain Kedgick returned to hand him to
      the room of state; and he had no sooner got him safe there, than he bawled
      down the staircase to his fellow-citizens below, that Mr Chuzzlewit was
      &lsquo;receiving.&rsquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      Up they came with a rush. Up they came until the room was full, and,
      through the open door, a dismal perspective of more to come, was shown
      upon the stairs. One after another, one after another, dozen after dozen,
      score after score, more, more, more, up they came; all shaking hands with
      Martin. Such varieties of hands, the thick, the thin, the short, the long,
      the fat, the lean, the coarse, the fine; such differences of temperature,
      the hot, the cold, the dry, the moist, the flabby; such diversities of
      grasp, the tight, the loose, the short-lived, and the lingering! Still up,
      up, up, more, more, more; and ever and anon the Captain&rsquo;s voice was heard
      above the crowd&mdash;&lsquo;There&rsquo;s more below! there&rsquo;s more below. Now,
      gentlemen you that have been introduced to Mr Chuzzlewit, will you clear
      gentlemen? Will you clear? Will you be so good as clear, gentlemen, and
      make a little room for more?&rsquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      Regardless of the Captain&rsquo;s cries, they didn&rsquo;t clear at all, but stood
      there, bolt upright and staring. Two gentlemen connected with the
      Watertoast Gazette had come express to get the matter for an article on
      Martin. They had agreed to divide the labour. One of them took him below
      the waistcoat. One above. Each stood directly in front of his subject with
      his head a little on one side, intent on his department. If Martin put one
      boot before the other, the lower gentleman was down upon him; he rubbed a
      pimple on his nose, and the upper gentleman booked it. He opened his mouth
      to speak, and the same gentleman was on one knee before him, looking in at
      his teeth, with the nice scrutiny of a dentist. Amateurs in the
      physiognomical and phrenological sciences roved about him with watchful
      eyes and itching fingers, and sometimes one, more daring than the rest,
      made a mad grasp at the back of his head, and vanished in the crowd. They
      had him in all points of view: in front, in profile, three-quarter face,
      and behind. Those who were not professional or scientific, audibly
      exchanged opinions on his looks. New lights shone in upon him, in respect
      of his nose. Contradictory rumours were abroad on the subject of his hair.
      And still the Captain&rsquo;s voice was heard&mdash;so stifled by the concourse,
      that he seemed to speak from underneath a feather-bed&mdash;exclaiming&mdash;&lsquo;Gentlemen,
      you that have been introduced to Mr Chuzzlewit, <i>will </i>you clear?&rsquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      Even when they began to clear it was no better; for then a stream of
      gentlemen, every one with a lady on each arm (exactly like the chorus to
      the National Anthem when Royalty goes in state to the play), came gliding
      in&mdash;every new group fresher than the last, and bent on staying to the
      latest moment. If they spoke to him, which was not often, they invariably
      asked the same questions, in the same tone; with no more remorse, or
      delicacy, or consideration, than if he had been a figure of stone,
      purchased, and paid for, and set up there for their delight. Even when, in
      the slow course of time, these died off, it was as bad as ever, if not
      worse; for then the boys grew bold, and came in as a class of themselves,
      and did everything that the grown-up people had done. Uncouth stragglers,
      too, appeared; men of a ghostly kind, who being in, didn&rsquo;t know how to get
      out again; insomuch that one silent gentleman with glazed and fishy eyes
      and only one button on his waistcoat (which was a very large metal one,
      and shone prodigiously), got behind the door, and stood there, like a
      clock, long after everybody else was gone.
    </p>
    <p>
      Martin felt, from pure fatigue, and heat, and worry, as if he could have
      fallen on the ground and willingly remained there, if they would but have
      had the mercy to leave him alone. But as letters and messages, threatening
      his public denouncement if he didn&rsquo;t see the senders, poured in like hail;
      and as more visitors came while he took his coffee by himself; and as
      Mark, with all his vigilance, was unable to keep them from the door; he
      resolved to go to bed&mdash;not that he felt at all sure of bed being any
      protection, but that he might not leave a forlorn hope untried.
    </p>
    <p>
      He had communicated this design to Mark, and was on the eve of escaping,
      when the door was thrown open in a great hurry, and an elderly gentleman
      entered; bringing with him a lady who certainly could not be considered
      young&mdash;that was matter of fact; and probably could not be considered
      handsome&mdash;but that was matter of opinion. She was very straight, very
      tall, and not at all flexible in face or figure. On her head she wore a
      great straw bonnet, with trimmings of the same, in which she looked as if
      she had been thatched by an unskillful labourer; and in her hand she held
      a most enormous fan.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Mr Chuzzlewit, I believe?&rsquo; said the gentleman.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;That is my name.&rsquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Sir,&rsquo; said the gentleman, &lsquo;I am pressed for time.&rsquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Thank God!&rsquo; thought Martin.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;I go back Toe my home, sir,&rsquo; pursued the gentleman, &lsquo;by the return train,
      which starts immediate. Start is not a word you use in your country, sir.&rsquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Oh yes, it is,&rsquo; said Martin.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;You air mistaken, sir,&rsquo; returned the gentleman, with great decision: &lsquo;but
      we will not pursue the subject, lest it should awake your preju&mdash;dice.
      Sir, Mrs Hominy.&rsquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      Martin bowed.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Mrs Hominy, sir, is the lady of Major Hominy, one of our chicest spirits;
      and belongs Toe one of our most aristocratic families. You air, p&rsquo;raps,
      acquainted, sir, with Mrs Hominy&rsquo;s writings.&rsquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      Martin couldn&rsquo;t say he was.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;You have much Toe learn, and Toe enjoy, sir,&rsquo; said the gentleman. &lsquo;Mrs
      Hominy is going Toe stay until the end of the Fall, sir, with her married
      daughter at the settlement of New Thermopylae, three days this side of
      Eden. Any attention, sir, that you can show Toe Mrs Hominy upon the
      journey, will be very grateful Toe the Major and our fellow-citizens. Mrs
      Hominy, I wish you good night, ma&rsquo;am, and a pleasant pro-gress on your
      route!&rsquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      Martin could scarcely believe it; but he had gone, and Mrs Hominy was
      drinking the milk.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;A&rsquo;most used-up I am, I do declare!&rsquo; she observed. &lsquo;The jolting in the
      cars is pretty nigh as bad as if the rail was full of snags and sawyers.&rsquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Snags and sawyers, ma&rsquo;am?&rsquo; said Martin.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Well, then, I do suppose you&rsquo;ll hardly realise my meaning, sir,&rsquo; said Mrs
      Hominy. &lsquo;My! Only think! <i>do</i> tell!&rsquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      It did not appear that these expressions, although they seemed to conclude
      with an urgent entreaty, stood in need of any answer; for Mrs Hominy,
      untying her bonnet-strings, observed that she would withdraw to lay that
      article of dress aside, and would return immediately.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Mark!&rsquo; said Martin. &lsquo;Touch me, will you. Am I awake?&rsquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Hominy is, sir,&rsquo; returned his partner&mdash;&lsquo;Broad awake! Just the sort
      of woman, sir, as would be discovered with her eyes wide open, and her
      mind a-working for her country&rsquo;s good, at any hour of the day or night.&rsquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      They had no opportunity of saying more, for Mrs Hominy stalked in again&mdash;very
      erect, in proof of her aristocratic blood; and holding in her clasped
      hands a red cotton pocket-handkerchief, perhaps a parting gift from that
      choice spirit, the Major. She had laid aside her bonnet, and now appeared
      in a highly aristocratic and classical cap, meeting beneath her chin: a
      style of headdress so admirably adapted to her countenance, that if the
      late Mr Grimaldi had appeared in the lappets of Mrs Siddons, a more
      complete effect could not have been produced.
    </p>
    <p>
      Martin handed her to a chair. Her first words arrested him before he could
      get back to his own seat.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Pray, sir!&rsquo; said Mrs Hominy, &lsquo;where do you hail from?&rsquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;I am afraid I am dull of comprehension,&rsquo; answered Martin, &lsquo;being
      extremely tired; but upon my word I don&rsquo;t understand you.&rsquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      Mrs Hominy shook her head with a melancholy smile that said, not
      inexpressively, &lsquo;They corrupt even the language in that old country!&rsquo; and
      added then, as coming down a step or two to meet his low capacity, &lsquo;Where
      was you rose?&rsquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Oh!&rsquo; said Martin &lsquo;I was born in Kent.&rsquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;And how do you like our country, sir?&rsquo; asked Mrs Hominy.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Very much indeed,&rsquo; said Martin, half asleep. &lsquo;At least&mdash;that is&mdash;pretty
      well, ma&rsquo;am.&rsquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Most strangers&mdash;and partick&rsquo;larly Britishers&mdash;are much
      surprised by what they see in the U-nited States,&rsquo; remarked Mrs Hominy.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;They have excellent reason to be so, ma&rsquo;am,&rsquo; said Martin. &lsquo;I never was so
      much surprised in all my life.&rsquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Our institutions make our people smart much, sir,&rsquo; Mrs Hominy remarked.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;The most short-sighted man could see that at a glance, with his naked
      eye,&rsquo; said Martin.
    </p>
    <p>
      Mrs Hominy was a philosopher and an authoress, and consequently had a
      pretty strong digestion; but this coarse, this indecorous phrase, was
      almost too much for her. For a gentleman sitting alone with a lady&mdash;although
      the door <i>was </i>open&mdash;to talk about a naked eye!
    </p>
    <p>
      A long interval elapsed before even she&mdash;woman of masculine and
      towering intellect though she was&mdash;could call up fortitude enough to
      resume the conversation. But Mrs Hominy was a traveller. Mrs Hominy was a
      writer of reviews and analytical disquisitions. Mrs Hominy had had her
      letters from abroad, beginning &lsquo;My ever dearest blank,&rsquo; and signed &lsquo;The
      Mother of the Modern Gracchi&rsquo; (meaning the married Miss Hominy), regularly
      printed in a public journal, with all the indignation in capitals, and all
      the sarcasm in italics. Mrs Hominy had looked on foreign countries with
      the eye of a perfect republican hot from the model oven; and Mrs Hominy
      could talk (or write) about them by the hour together. So Mrs Hominy at
      last came down on Martin heavily, and as he was fast asleep, she had it
      all her own way, and bruised him to her heart&rsquo;s content.
    </p>
    <p>
      It is no great matter what Mrs Hominy said, save that she had learnt it
      from the cant of a class, and a large class, of her fellow countrymen, who
      in their every word, avow themselves to be as senseless to the high
      principles on which America sprang, a nation, into life, as any Orson in
      her legislative halls. Who are no more capable of feeling, or of caring if
      they did feel, that by reducing their own country to the ebb of honest
      men&rsquo;s contempt, they put in hazard the rights of nations yet unborn, and
      very progress of the human race, than are the swine who wallow in their
      streets. Who think that crying out to other nations, old in their
      iniquity, &lsquo;We are no worse than you!&rsquo; (No worse!) is high defence and
      &lsquo;vantage-ground enough for that Republic, but yesterday let loose upon her
      noble course, and but to-day so maimed and lame, so full of sores and
      ulcers, foul to the eye and almost hopeless to the sense, that her best
      friends turn from the loathsome creature with disgust. Who, having by
      their ancestors declared and won their Independence, because they would
      not bend the knee to certain Public vices and corruptions, and would not
      abrogate the truth, run riot in the Bad, and turn their backs upon the
      Good; and lying down contented with the wretched boast that other Temples
      also are of glass, and stones which batter theirs may be flung back; show
      themselves, in that alone, as immeasurably behind the import of the trust
      they hold, and as unworthy to possess it as if the sordid hucksterings of
      all their little governments&mdash;each one a kingdom in its small
      depravity&mdash;were brought into a heap for evidence against them.
    </p>
    <p>
      Martin by degrees became so far awake, that he had a sense of a terrible
      oppression on his mind; an imperfect dream that he had murdered a
      particular friend, and couldn&rsquo;t get rid of the body. When his eyes opened
      it was staring him full in the face. There was the horrible Hominy talking
      deep truths in a melodious snuffle, and pouring forth her mental
      endowments to such an extent that the Major&rsquo;s bitterest enemy, hearing
      her, would have forgiven him from the bottom of his heart. Martin might
      have done something desperate if the gong had not sounded for supper; but
      sound it did most opportunely; and having stationed Mrs Hominy at the
      upper end of the table he took refuge at the lower end himself; whence,
      after a hasty meal he stole away, while the lady was yet busied with dried
      beef and a saucer-full of pickled fixings.
    </p>
    <p>
      It would be difficult to give an adequate idea of Mrs Hominy&rsquo;s freshness
      next day, or of the avidity with which she went headlong into moral
      philosophy at breakfast. Some little additional degree of asperity,
      perhaps, was visible in her features, but not more than the pickles would
      have naturally produced. All that day she clung to Martin. She sat beside
      him while he received his friends (for there was another Reception, yet
      more numerous than the former), propounded theories, and answered
      imaginary objections, so that Martin really began to think he must be
      dreaming, and speaking for two; she quoted interminable passages from
      certain essays on government, written by herself; used the Major&rsquo;s
      pocket-handkerchief as if the snuffle were a temporary malady, of which
      she was determined to rid herself by some means or other; and, in short,
      was such a remarkable companion, that Martin quite settled it between
      himself and his conscience, that in any new settlement it would be
      absolutely necessary to have such a person knocked on the head for the
      general peace of society.
    </p>
    <p>
      In the meantime Mark was busy, from early in the morning until late at
      night, in getting on board the steamboat such provisions, tools and other
      necessaries, as they had been forewarned it would be wise to take. The
      purchase of these things, and the settlement of their bill at the
      National, reduced their finances to so low an ebb, that if the captain had
      delayed his departure any longer, they would have been in almost as bad a
      plight as the unfortunate poorer emigrants, who (seduced on board by
      solemn advertisement) had been living on the lower deck a whole week, and
      exhausting their miserable stock of provisions before the voyage
      commenced. There they were, all huddled together with the engine and the
      fires. Farmers who had never seen a plough; woodmen who had never used an
      axe; builders who couldn&rsquo;t make a box; cast out of their own land, with
      not a hand to aid them: newly come into an unknown world, children in
      helplessness, but men in wants&mdash;with younger children at their backs,
      to live or die as it might happen!
    </p>
    <p>
      The morning came, and they would start at noon. Noon came, and they would
      start at night. But nothing is eternal in this world; not even the
      procrastination of an American skipper; and at night all was ready.
    </p>
    <p>
      Dispirited and weary to the last degree, but a greater lion than ever (he
      had done nothing all the afternoon but answer letters from strangers; half
      of them about nothing; half about borrowing money, and all requiring an
      instantaneous reply), Martin walked down to the wharf, through a concourse
      of people, with Mrs Hominy upon his arm; and went on board. But Mark was
      bent on solving the riddle of this lionship, if he could; and so, not
      without the risk of being left behind, ran back to the hotel.
    </p>
    <p>
      Captain Kedgick was sitting in the colonnade, with a julep on his knee,
      and a cigar in his mouth. He caught Mark&rsquo;s eye, and said:
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Why, what the &lsquo;Tarnal brings you here?&rsquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;I&rsquo;ll tell you plainly what it is, Captain,&rsquo; said Mark. &lsquo;I want to ask you
      a question.&rsquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;A man may <i>ask </i>a question, so he may,&rsquo; returned Kedgick; strongly implying
      that another man might not answer a question, so he mightn&rsquo;t.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;What have they been making so much of him for, now?&rsquo; said Mark, slyly.
      &lsquo;Come!&rsquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Our people like ex-citement,&rsquo; answered Kedgick, sucking his cigar.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;But how has he excited &lsquo;em?&rsquo; asked Mark.
    </p>
    <p>
      The Captain looked at him as if he were half inclined to unburden his mind
      of a capital joke.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;You air a-going?&rsquo; he said.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Going!&rsquo; cried Mark. &lsquo;Ain&rsquo;t every moment precious?&rsquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Our people like ex-citement,&rsquo; said the Captain, whispering. &lsquo;He ain&rsquo;t
      like emigrants in gin&rsquo;ral; and he excited &lsquo;em along of this;&rsquo; he winked
      and burst into a smothered laugh; &lsquo;along of this. Scadder is a smart man,
      and&mdash;and&mdash;nobody as goes to Eden ever comes back alive!&rsquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      The wharf was close at hand, and at that instant Mark could hear them
      shouting out his name; could even hear Martin calling to him to make
      haste, or they would be separated. It was too late to mend the matter, or
      put any face upon it but the best. He gave the Captain a parting
      benediction, and ran off like a race-horse.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Mark! Mark!&rsquo; cried Martin.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Here am I, sir!&rsquo; shouted Mark, suddenly replying from the edge of the
      quay, and leaping at a bound on board. &lsquo;Never was half so jolly, sir. All
      right. Haul in! Go ahead!&rsquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      The sparks from the wood fire streamed upward from the two chimneys, as if
      the vessel were a great firework just lighted; and they roared away upon
      the dark water.

      CHAPTER TWENTY-THREE
    </h2>
    <p>
      MARTIN AND HIS PARTNER TAKE POSSESSION OF THEIR ESTATE. THE JOYFUL
      OCCASION INVOLVES SOME FURTHER ACCOUNT OF EDEN
    </p>
    <p>
      There happened to be on board the steamboat several gentlemen passengers,
      of the same stamp as Martin&rsquo;s New York friend Mr Bevan; and in their
      society he was cheerful and happy. They released him as well as they could
      from the intellectual entanglements of Mrs Hominy; and exhibited, in all
      they said and did, so much good sense and high feeling, that he could not
      like them too well. &lsquo;If this were a republic of Intellect and Worth,&rsquo; he
      said, &lsquo;instead of vapouring and jobbing, they would not want the levers to
      keep it in motion.&rsquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Having good tools, and using bad ones,&rsquo; returned Mr Tapley, &lsquo;would look
      as if they was rather a poor sort of carpenters, sir, wouldn&rsquo;t it?&rsquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      Martin nodded. &lsquo;As if their work were infinitely above their powers and
      purpose, Mark; and they botched it in consequence.&rsquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;The best on it is,&rsquo; said Mark, &lsquo;that when they do happen to make a decent
      stroke; such as better workmen, with no such opportunities, make every day
      of their lives and think nothing of&mdash;they begin to sing out so
      surprising loud. Take notice of my words, sir. If ever the defaulting part
      of this here country pays its debts&mdash;along of finding that not paying
      &lsquo;em won&rsquo;t do in a commercial point of view, you see, and is inconvenient
      in its consequences&mdash;they&rsquo;ll take such a shine out of it, and make
      such bragging speeches, that a man might suppose no borrowed money had
      ever been paid afore, since the world was first begun. That&rsquo;s the way they
      gammon each other, sir. Bless you, I know &lsquo;em. Take notice of my words,
      now!&rsquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;You seem to be growing profoundly sagacious!&rsquo; cried Martin, laughing.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Whether that is,&rsquo; thought Mark, &lsquo;because I&rsquo;m a day&rsquo;s journey nearer Eden,
      and am brightening up afore I die, I can&rsquo;t say. P&rsquo;rhaps by the time I get
      there I shall have growed into a prophet.&rsquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      He gave no utterance to these sentiments; but the excessive joviality they
      inspired within him, and the merriment they brought upon his shining face,
      were quite enough for Martin. Although he might sometimes profess to make
      light of his partner&rsquo;s inexhaustible cheerfulness, and might sometimes, as
      in the case of Zephaniah Scadder, find him too jocose a commentator, he
      was always sensible of the effect of his example in rousing him to
      hopefulness and courage. Whether he were in the humour to profit by it,
      mattered not a jot. It was contagious, and he could not choose but be
      affected.
    </p>
    <p>
      At first they parted with some of their passengers once or twice a day,
      and took in others to replace them. But by degrees, the towns upon their
      route became more thinly scattered; and for many hours together they would
      see no other habitations than the huts of the wood-cutters, where the
      vessel stopped for fuel. Sky, wood, and water all the livelong day; and
      heat that blistered everything it touched.
    </p>
    <p>
      On they toiled through great solitudes, where the trees upon the banks
      grew thick and close; and floated in the stream; and held up shrivelled
      arms from out the river&rsquo;s depths; and slid down from the margin of the
      land, half growing, half decaying, in the miry water. On through the weary
      day and melancholy night; beneath the burning sun, and in the mist and
      vapour of the evening; on, until return appeared impossible, and
      restoration to their home a miserable dream.
    </p>
    <p>
      They had now but few people on board, and these few were as flat, as dull,
      and stagnant, as the vegetation that oppressed their eyes. No sound of
      cheerfulness or hope was heard; no pleasant talk beguiled the tardy time;
      no little group made common cause against the full depression of the
      scene. But that, at certain periods, they swallowed food together from a
      common trough, it might have been old Charon&rsquo;s boat, conveying melancholy
      shades to judgment.
    </p>
    <p>
      At length they drew near New Thermopylae; where, that same evening, Mrs
      Hominy would disembark. A gleam of comfort sunk into Martin&rsquo;s bosom when
      she told him this. Mark needed none; but he was not displeased.
    </p>
    <p>
      It was almost night when they came alongside the landing-place. A steep
      bank with an hotel like a barn on the top of it; a wooden store or two;
      and a few scattered sheds.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;You sleep here to-night, and go on in the morning, I suppose, ma&rsquo;am?&rsquo;
      said Martin.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Where should I go on to?&rsquo; cried the mother of the modern Gracchi.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;To New Thermopylae.&rsquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;My! ain&rsquo;t I there?&rsquo; said Mrs Hominy.
    </p>
    <p>
      Martin looked for it all round the darkening panorama; but he couldn&rsquo;t see
      it, and was obliged to say so.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Why that&rsquo;s it!&rsquo; cried Mrs Hominy, pointing to the sheds just mentioned.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;<i>That</i>!&rsquo; exclaimed Martin.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Ah! that; and work it which way you will, it whips Eden,&rsquo; said Mrs
      Hominy, nodding her head with great expression.
    </p>
    <p>
      The married Miss Hominy, who had come on board with her husband, gave to
      this statement her most unqualified support, as did that gentleman also.
      Martin gratefully declined their invitation to regale himself at their
      house during the half hour of the vessel&rsquo;s stay; and having escorted Mrs
      Hominy and the red pocket-handkerchief (which was still on active service)
      safely across the gangway, returned in a thoughtful mood to watch the
      emigrants as they removed their goods ashore.
    </p>
    <p>
      Mark, as he stood beside him, glanced in his face from time to time;
      anxious to discover what effect this dialogue had had upon him, and not
      unwilling that his hopes should be dashed before they reached their
      destination, so that the blow he feared might be broken in its fall. But
      saving that he sometimes looked up quickly at the poor erections on the
      hill, he gave him no clue to what was passing in his mind, until they were
      again upon their way.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Mark,&rsquo; he said then, &lsquo;are there really none but ourselves on board this
      boat who are bound for Eden?&rsquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;None at all, sir. Most of &lsquo;em, as you know, have stopped short; and the
      few that are left are going further on. What matters that! More room there
      for us, sir.&rsquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Oh, to be sure!&rsquo; said Martin. &lsquo;But I was thinking&mdash;&rsquo; and there he
      paused.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Yes, sir?&rsquo; observed Mark.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;How odd it was that the people should have arranged to try their fortune
      at a wretched hole like that, for instance, when there is such a much
      better, and such a very different kind of place, near at hand, as one may
      say.&rsquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      He spoke in a tone so very different from his usual confidence, and with
      such an obvious dread of Mark&rsquo;s reply, that the good-natured fellow was
      full of pity.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Why, you know, sir,&rsquo; said Mark, as gently as he could by any means
      insinuate the observation, &lsquo;we must guard against being too sanguine.
      There&rsquo;s no occasion for it, either, because we&rsquo;re determined to make the
      best of everything, after we know the worst of it. Ain&rsquo;t we, sir?&rsquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      Martin looked at him, but answered not a word.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Even Eden, you know, ain&rsquo;t all built,&rsquo; said Mark.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;In the name of Heaven, man,&rsquo; cried Martin angrily, &lsquo;don&rsquo;t talk of Eden in
      the same breath with that place. Are you mad? There&mdash;God forgive me!&mdash;don&rsquo;t
      think harshly of me for my temper!&rsquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      After that, he turned away, and walked to and fro upon the deck full two
      hours. Nor did he speak again, except to say &lsquo;Good night,&rsquo; until next day;
      nor even then upon this subject, but on other topics quite foreign to the
      purpose.
    </p>
    <p>
      As they proceeded further on their track, and came more and more towards
      their journey&rsquo;s end, the monotonous desolation of the scene increased to
      that degree, that for any redeeming feature it presented to their eyes,
      they might have entered, in the body, on the grim domains of Giant
      Despair. A flat morass, bestrewn with fallen timber; a marsh on which the
      good growth of the earth seemed to have been wrecked and cast away, that
      from its decomposing ashes vile and ugly things might rise; where the very
      trees took the aspect of huge weeds, begotten of the slime from which they
      sprung, by the hot sun that burnt them up; where fatal maladies, seeking
      whom they might infect, came forth at night in misty shapes, and creeping
      out upon the water, hunted them like spectres until day; where even the
      blessed sun, shining down on festering elements of corruption and disease,
      became a horror; this was the realm of Hope through which they moved.
    </p>
    <p>
      At last they stopped. At Eden too. The waters of the Deluge might have
      left it but a week before; so choked with slime and matted growth was the
      hideous swamp which bore that name.
    </p>
    <p>
      There being no depth of water close in shore, they landed from the
      vessel&rsquo;s boat, with all their goods beside them. There were a few
      log-houses visible among the dark trees; the best, a cow-shed or a rude
      stable; but for the wharves, the market-place, the public buildings&mdash;
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Here comes an Edener,&rsquo; said Mark. &lsquo;He&rsquo;ll get us help to carry these
      things up. Keep a good heart, sir. Hallo there!&rsquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      The man advanced toward them through the thickening gloom, very slowly;
      leaning on a stick. As he drew nearer, they observed that he was pale and
      worn, and that his anxious eyes were deeply sunken in his head. His dress
      of homespun blue hung about him in rags; his feet and head were bare. He
      sat down on a stump half-way, and beckoned them to come to him. When they
      complied, he put his hand upon his side as if in pain, and while he
      fetched his breath stared at them, wondering.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Strangers!&rsquo; he exclaimed, as soon as he could speak.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;The very same,&rsquo; said Mark. &lsquo;How are you, sir?&rsquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;I&rsquo;ve had the fever very bad,&rsquo; he answered faintly. &lsquo;I haven&rsquo;t stood
      upright these many weeks. Those are your notions I see,&rsquo; pointing to their
      property.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Yes, sir,&rsquo; said Mark, &lsquo;they are. You couldn&rsquo;t recommend us some one as
      would lend a hand to help carry &lsquo;em up to the&mdash;to the town, could
      you, sir?&rsquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;My eldest son would do it if he could,&rsquo; replied the man; &lsquo;but today he
      has his chill upon him, and is lying wrapped up in the blankets. My
      youngest died last week.&rsquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;I&rsquo;m sorry for it, governor, with all my heart,&rsquo; said Mark, shaking him by
      the hand. &lsquo;Don&rsquo;t mind us. Come along with me, and I&rsquo;ll give you an arm
      back. The goods is safe enough, sir&rsquo;&mdash;to Martin&mdash;&lsquo;there ain&rsquo;t
      many people about, to make away with &lsquo;em. What a comfort that is!&rsquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;No,&rsquo; cried the man. &lsquo;You must look for such folk here,&rsquo; knocking his
      stick upon the ground, &lsquo;or yonder in the bush, towards the north. We&rsquo;ve
      buried most of &lsquo;em. The rest have gone away. Them that we have here, don&rsquo;t
      come out at night.&rsquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;The night air ain&rsquo;t quite wholesome, I suppose?&rsquo; said Mark.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;It&rsquo;s deadly poison,&rsquo; was the settler&rsquo;s answer.
    </p>
    <p>
      Mark showed no more uneasiness than if it had been commended to him as
      ambrosia; but he gave the man his arm, and as they went along explained to
      him the nature of their purchase, and inquired where it lay. Close to his
      own log-house, he said; so close that he had used their dwelling as a
      store-house for some corn; they must excuse it that night, but he would
      endeavour to get it taken out upon the morrow. He then gave them to
      understand, as an additional scrap of local chit-chat, that he had buried
      the last proprietor with his own hands; a piece of information which Mark
      also received without the least abatement of his equanimity.
    </p>
    <p>
      In a word, he conducted them to a miserable cabin, rudely constructed of
      the trunks of trees; the door of which had either fallen down or been
      carried away long ago; and which was consequently open to the wild
      landscape and the dark night. Saving for the little store he had
      mentioned, it was perfectly bare of all furniture; but they had left a
      chest upon the landing-place, and he gave them a rude torch in lieu of
      candle. This latter acquisition Mark planted in the earth, and then
      declaring that the mansion &lsquo;looked quite comfortable,&rsquo; hurried Martin off
      again to help bring up the chest. And all the way to the landing-place and
      back, Mark talked incessantly; as if he would infuse into his partner&rsquo;s
      breast some faint belief that they had arrived under the most auspicious
      and cheerful of all imaginable circumstances.
    </p>
    <p>
      But many a man who would have stood within a home dismantled, strong in
      his passion and design of vengeance, has had the firmness of his nature
      conquered by the razing of an air-built castle. When the log-hut received
      them for the second time, Martin laid down upon the ground, and wept
      aloud.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Lord love you, sir!&rsquo; cried Mr Tapley, in great terror; &lsquo;Don&rsquo;t do that!
      Don&rsquo;t do that, sir! Anything but that! It never helped man, woman, or
      child, over the lowest fence yet, sir, and it never will. Besides its
      being of no use to you, it&rsquo;s worse than of no use to me, for the least
      sound of it will knock me flat down. I can&rsquo;t stand up agin it, sir.
      Anything but that!&rsquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      There is no doubt he spoke the truth, for the extraordinary alarm with
      which he looked at Martin as he paused upon his knees before the chest, in
      the act of unlocking it, to say these words, sufficiently confirmed him.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;I ask your forgiveness a thousand times, my dear fellow,&rsquo; said Martin. &lsquo;I
      couldn&rsquo;t have helped it, if death had been the penalty.&rsquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Ask my forgiveness!&rsquo; said Mark, with his accustomed cheerfulness, as he
      proceeded to unpack the chest. &lsquo;The head partner a-asking forgiveness of
      Co., eh? There must be something wrong in the firm when that happens. I
      must have the books inspected and the accounts gone over immediate. Here
      we are. Everything in its proper place. Here&rsquo;s the salt pork. Here&rsquo;s the
      biscuit. Here&rsquo;s the whiskey. Uncommon good it smells too. Here&rsquo;s the tin
      pot. This tin pot&rsquo;s a small fortun&rsquo; in itself! Here&rsquo;s the blankets. Here&rsquo;s
      the axe. Who says we ain&rsquo;t got a first-rate fit out? I feel as if I was a
      cadet gone out to Indy, and my noble father was chairman of the Board of
      Directors. Now, when I&rsquo;ve got some water from the stream afore the door
      and mixed the grog,&rsquo; cried Mark, running out to suit the action to the
      word, &lsquo;there&rsquo;s a supper ready, comprising every delicacy of the season.
      Here we are, sir, all complete. For what we are going to receive, et
      cetrer. Lord bless you, sir, it&rsquo;s very like a gipsy party!&rsquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      It was impossible not to take heart, in the company of such a man as this.
      Martin sat upon the ground beside the box; took out his knife; and ate and
      drank sturdily.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Now you see,&rsquo; said Mark, when they had made a hearty meal; &lsquo;with your
      knife and mine, I sticks this blanket right afore the door. Or where, in a
      state of high civilization, the door would be. And very neat it looks.
      Then I stops the aperture below, by putting the chest agin it. And very
      neat <i>that </i>looks. Then there&rsquo;s your blanket, sir. Then here&rsquo;s mine. And
      what&rsquo;s to hinder our passing a good night?&rsquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      For all his light-hearted speaking, it was long before he slept himself.
      He wrapped his blanket round him, put the axe ready to his hand, and lay
      across the threshold of the door; too anxious and too watchful to close
      his eyes. The novelty of their dreary situation, the dread of some
      rapacious animal or human enemy, the terrible uncertainty of their means
      of subsistence, the apprehension of death, the immense distance and the
      hosts of obstacles between themselves and England, were fruitful sources
      of disquiet in the deep silence of the night. Though Martin would have had
      him think otherwise, Mark felt that he was waking also, and a prey to the
      same reflections. This was almost worse than all, for if he began to brood
      over their miseries instead of trying to make head against them there
      could be little doubt that such a state of mind would powerfully assist
      the influence of the pestilent climate. Never had the light of day been
      half so welcome to his eyes, as when awaking from a fitful doze, Mark saw
      it shining through the blanket in the doorway.
    </p>
    <p>
      He stole out gently, for his companion was sleeping now; and having
      refreshed himself by washing in the river, where it snowed before the
      door, took a rough survey of the settlement. There were not above a score
      of cabins in the whole; half of these appeared untenanted; all were rotten
      and decayed. The most tottering, abject, and forlorn among them was
      called, with great propriety, the Bank, and National Credit Office. It had
      some feeble props about it, but was settling deep down in the mud, past
      all recovery.
    </p>
    <p>
      Here and there an effort had been made to clear the land, and something
      like a field had been marked out, where, among the stumps and ashes of
      burnt trees, a scanty crop of Indian corn was growing. In some quarters, a
      snake or zigzag fence had been begun, but in no instance had it been
      completed; and the felled logs, half hidden in the soil, lay mouldering
      away. Three or four meagre dogs, wasted and vexed with hunger; some
      long-legged pigs, wandering away into the woods in search of food; some
      children, nearly naked, gazing at him from the huts; were all the living
      things he saw. A fetid vapour, hot and sickening as the breath of an oven,
      rose up from the earth, and hung on everything around; and as his
      foot-prints sunk into the marshy ground, a black ooze started forth to
      blot them out.
    </p>
    <p>
      Their own land was mere forest. The trees had grown so think and close
      that they shouldered one another out of their places, and the weakest,
      forced into shapes of strange distortion, languished like cripples. The
      best were stunted, from the pressure and the want of room; and high about
      the stems of all grew long rank grass, dank weeds, and frowsy underwood;
      not divisible into their separate kinds, but tangled all together in a
      heap; a jungle deep and dark, with neither earth nor water at its roots,
      but putrid matter, formed of the pulpy offal of the two, and of their own
      corruption.
    </p>
    <p>
      He went down to the landing-place where they had left their goods last
      night; and there he found some half-dozen men&mdash;wan and forlorn to
      look at, but ready enough to assist&mdash;who helped him to carry them to
      the log-house. They shook their heads in speaking of the settlement, and
      had no comfort to give him. Those who had the means of going away had all
      deserted it. They who were left had lost their wives, their children,
      friends, or brothers there, and suffered much themselves. Most of them
      were ill then; none were the men they had been once. They frankly offered
      their assistance and advice, and, leaving him for that time, went sadly
      off upon their several tasks.
    </p>
    <p>
      Martin was by this time stirring; but he had greatly changed, even in one
      night. He was very pale and languid; he spoke of pains and weakness in his
      limbs, and complained that his sight was dim, and his voice feeble.
      Increasing in his own briskness as the prospect grew more and more dismal,
      Mark brought away a door from one of the deserted houses, and fitted it to
      their own habitation; then went back again for a rude bench he had
      observed, with which he presently returned in triumph; and having put this
      piece of furniture outside the house, arranged the notable tin pot and
      other such movables upon it, that it might represent a dresser or a
      sideboard. Greatly satisfied with this arrangement, he next rolled their
      cask of flour into the house and set it up on end in one corner, where it
      served for a side-table. No better dining-table could be required than the
      chest, which he solemnly devoted to that useful service thenceforth. Their
      blankets, clothes, and the like, he hung on pegs and nails. And lastly, he
      brought forth a great placard (which Martin in the exultation of his heart
      had prepared with his own hands at the National Hotel) bearing the
      inscription, CHUZZLEWIT &amp; CO., ARCHITECTS AND SURVEYORS, which he
      displayed upon the most conspicuous part of the premises, with as much
      gravity as if the thriving city of Eden had a real existence, and they
      expected to be overwhelmed with business.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;These here tools,&rsquo; said Mark, bringing forward Martin&rsquo;s case of
      instruments and sticking the compasses upright in a stump before the door,
      &lsquo;shall be set out in the open air to show that we come provided. And now,
      if any gentleman wants a house built, he&rsquo;d better give his orders, afore
      we&rsquo;re other ways bespoke.&rsquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      Considering the intense heat of the weather, this was not a bad morning&rsquo;s
      work; but without pausing for a moment, though he was streaming at every
      pore, Mark vanished into the house again, and presently reappeared with a
      hatchet; intent on performing some impossibilities with that implement.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Here&rsquo;s ugly old tree in the way, sir,&rsquo; he observed, &lsquo;which&rsquo;ll be all the
      better down. We can build the oven in the afternoon. There never was such
      a handy spot for clay as Eden is. That&rsquo;s convenient, anyhow.&rsquo;
    </p>

    <p>
      But Martin gave him no answer. He had sat the whole time with his head
      upon his hands, gazing at the current as it rolled swiftly by; thinking,
      perhaps, how fast it moved towards the open sea, the high road to the home
      he never would behold again.
    </p>
    <p>
      Not even the vigorous strokes which Mark dealt at the tree awoke him from
      his mournful meditation. Finding all his endeavours to rouse him of no
      use, Mark stopped in his work and came towards him.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Don&rsquo;t give in, sir,&rsquo; said Mr Tapley.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Oh, Mark,&rsquo; returned his friend, &lsquo;what have I done in all my life that has
      deserved this heavy fate?&rsquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Why, sir,&rsquo; returned Mark, &lsquo;for the matter of that, everybody as is here
      might say the same thing; many of &lsquo;em with better reason p&rsquo;raps than you
      or me. Hold up, sir. Do something. Couldn&rsquo;t you ease your mind, now, don&rsquo;t
      you think, by making some personal obserwations in a letter to Scadder?&rsquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;No,&rsquo; said Martin, shaking his head sorrowfully: &lsquo;I am past that.&rsquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;But if you&rsquo;re past that already,&rsquo; returned Mark, &lsquo;you must be ill, and
      ought to be attended to.&rsquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Don&rsquo;t mind me,&rsquo; said Martin. &lsquo;Do the best you can for yourself. You&rsquo;ll
      soon have only yourself to consider. And then God speed you home, and
      forgive me for bringing you here! I am destined to die in this place. I
      felt it the instant I set foot upon the shore. Sleeping or waking, Mark, I
      dreamed it all last night.&rsquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;I said you must be ill,&rsquo; returned Mark, tenderly, &lsquo;and now I&rsquo;m sure of
      it. A touch of fever and ague caught on these rivers, I dare say; but
      bless you, <i>that&rsquo;s</i> nothing. It&rsquo;s only a seasoning, and we must all be
      seasoned, one way or another. That&rsquo;s religion that is, you know,&rsquo; said
      Mark.
    </p>
    <p>
      He only sighed and shook his head.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Wait half a minute,&rsquo; said Mark cheerily, &lsquo;till I run up to one of our
      neighbours and ask what&rsquo;s best to be took, and borrow a little of it to
      give you; and to-morrow you&rsquo;ll find yourself as strong as ever again. I
      won&rsquo;t be gone a minute. Don&rsquo;t give in while I&rsquo;m away, whatever you do!&rsquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      Throwing down his hatchet, he sped away immediately, but stopped when he
      had got a little distance, and looked back; then hurried on again.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Now, Mr Tapley,&rsquo; said Mark, giving himself a tremendous blow in the chest
      by way of reviver, &lsquo;just you attend to what I&rsquo;ve got to say. Things is
      looking about as bad as they <i>can </i>look, young man. You&rsquo;ll not have such
      another opportunity for showing your jolly disposition, my fine fellow, as
      long as you live. And therefore, Tapley, Now&rsquo;s your time to come out
      strong; or Never!&rsquo;

      CHAPTER TWENTY-FOUR
    </h2>
    <p>
      REPORTS PROGRESS IN CERTAIN HOMELY MATTERS OF LOVE, HATRED, JEALOUSY, AND
      REVENGE
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Hallo, Pecksniff!&rsquo; cried Mr Jonas from the parlour. &lsquo;Isn&rsquo;t somebody
      a-going to open that precious old door of yours?&rsquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Immediately, Mr Jonas. Immediately.&rsquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Ecod,&rsquo; muttered the orphan, &lsquo;not before it&rsquo;s time neither. Whoever it is,
      has knocked three times, and each one loud enough to wake the&mdash;&rsquo; he
      had such a repugnance to the idea of waking the Dead, that he stopped even
      then with the words upon his tongue, and said, instead, &lsquo;the Seven
      Sleepers.&rsquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Immediately, Mr Jonas; immediately,&rsquo; repeated Pecksniff. &lsquo;Thomas Pinch&rsquo;&mdash;he
      couldn&rsquo;t make up his mind, in his great agitation, whether to call Tom his
      dear friend or a villain, so he shook his fist at him <i>pro tem</i>&mdash;&lsquo;go up
      to my daughters&rsquo; room, and tell them who is here. Say, Silence. Silence!
      Do you hear me, sir?
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Directly, sir!&rsquo; cried Tom, departing, in a state of much amazement, on
      his errand.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;You&rsquo;ll&mdash;ha, ha, ha!&mdash;you&rsquo;ll excuse me, Mr Jonas, if I close
      this door a moment, will you?&rsquo; said Pecksniff. &lsquo;This may be a professional
      call. Indeed I am pretty sure it is. Thank you.&rsquo; Then Mr Pecksniff, gently
      warbling a rustic stave, put on his garden hat, seized a spade, and opened
      the street door; calmly appearing on the threshold, as if he thought he
      had, from his vineyard, heard a modest rap, but was not quite certain.
    </p>
    <p>
      Seeing a gentleman and lady before him, he started back in as much
      confusion as a good man with a crystal conscience might betray in mere
      surprise. Recognition came upon him the next moment, and he cried:
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Mr Chuzzlewit! Can I believe my eyes! My dear sir; my good sir! A joyful
      hour, a happy hour indeed. Pray, my dear sir, walk in. You find me in my
      garden-dress. You will excuse it, I know. It is an ancient pursuit,
      gardening. Primitive, my dear sir. Or, if I am not mistaken, Adam was the
      first of our calling. <i>my</i> Eve, I grieve to say is no more, sir; but&rsquo;&mdash;here
      he pointed to his spade, and shook his head as if he were not cheerful
      without an effort&mdash;&lsquo;but I do a little bit of Adam still.&rsquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      He had by this time got them into the best parlour, where the portrait by
      Spiller, and the bust by Spoker, were.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;My daughters,&rsquo; said Mr Pecksniff, &lsquo;will be overjoyed. If I could feel
      weary upon such a theme, I should have been worn out long ago, my dear
      sir, by their constant anticipation of this happiness and their repeated
      allusions to our meeting at Mrs Todgers&rsquo;s. Their fair young friend, too,&rsquo;
      said Mr Pecksniff, &lsquo;whom they so desire to know and love&mdash;indeed to
      know her, is to love&mdash;I hope I see her well. I hope in saying,
      &ldquo;Welcome to my humble roof!&rdquo; I find some echo in her own sentiments. If
      features are an index to the heart, I have no fears of that. An extremely
      engaging expression of countenance, Mr Chuzzlewit, my dear sir&mdash;very
      much so!&rsquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Mary,&rsquo; said the old man, &lsquo;Mr Pecksniff flatters you. But flattery from
      him is worth the having. He is not a dealer in it, and it comes from his
      heart. We thought Mr&mdash;&rsquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Pinch,&rsquo; said Mary.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Mr Pinch would have arrived before us, Pecksniff.&rsquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;He did arrive before you, my dear sir,&rsquo; retorted Pecksniff, raising his
      voice for the edification of Tom upon the stairs, &lsquo;and was about, I dare
      say, to tell me of your coming, when I begged him first to knock at my
      daughters&rsquo; chamber, and inquire after Charity, my dear child, who is not
      so well as I could wish. No,&rsquo; said Mr Pecksniff, answering their looks, &lsquo;I
      am sorry to say, she is not. It is merely an hysterical affection; nothing
      more, I am not uneasy. Mr Pinch! Thomas!&rsquo; exclaimed Pecksniff, in his
      kindest accents. &lsquo;Pray come in. I shall make no stranger of you. Thomas is
      a friend of mine, of rather long-standing, Mr Chuzzlewit, you must know.&rsquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Thank you, sir,&rsquo; said Tom. &lsquo;You introduce me very kindly, and speak of me
      in terms of which I am very proud.&rsquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Old Thomas!&rsquo; cried his master, pleasantly &lsquo;God bless you!&rsquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      Tom reported that the young ladies would appear directly, and that the
      best refreshments which the house afforded were even then in preparation,
      under their joint superintendence. While he was speaking, the old man
      looked at him intently, though with less harshness than was common to him;
      nor did the mutual embarrassment of Tom and the young lady, to whatever
      cause he attributed it, seem to escape his observation.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Pecksniff,&rsquo; he said after a pause, rising and taking him aside towards
      the window, &lsquo;I was much shocked on hearing of my brother&rsquo;s death. We had
      been strangers for many years. My only comfort is that he must have lived
      the happier and better man for having associated no hopes or schemes with
      me. Peace to his memory! We were play-fellows once; and it would have been
      better for us both if we had died then.&rsquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      Finding him in this gentle mood, Mr Pecksniff began to see another way out
      of his difficulties, besides the casting overboard of Jonas.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;That any man, my dear sir, could possibly be the happier for not knowing
      you,&rsquo; he returned, &lsquo;you will excuse my doubting. But that Mr Anthony, in
      the evening of his life, was happier in the affection of his excellent son&mdash;a
      pattern, my dear sir, a pattern to all sons&mdash;and in the care of a
      distant relation who, however lowly in his means of serving him, had no
      bounds to his inclination; I can inform you.&rsquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;How&rsquo;s this?&rsquo; said the old man. &lsquo;You are not a legatee?&rsquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;You don&rsquo;t,&rsquo; said Mr Pecksniff, with a melancholy pressure of his hand,
      &lsquo;quite understand my nature yet, I find. No, sir, I am not a legatee. I am
      proud to say I am not a legatee. I am proud to say that neither of my
      children is a legatee. And yet, sir, I was with him at his own request. <i>he</i>
      understood me somewhat better, sir. He wrote and said, &ldquo;I am sick. I am
      sinking. Come to me!&rdquo; I went to him. I sat beside his bed, sir, and I
      stood beside his grave. Yes, at the risk of offending even you, I did it,
      sir. Though the avowal should lead to our instant separation, and to the
      severing of those tender ties between us which have recently been formed,
      I make it. But I am not a legatee,&rsquo; said Mr Pecksniff, smiling
      dispassionately; &lsquo;and I never expected to be a legatee. I knew better!&rsquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;His son a pattern!&rsquo; cried old Martin. &lsquo;How can you tell me that? My
      brother had in his wealth the usual doom of wealth, and root of misery. He
      carried his corrupting influence with him, go where he would; and shed it
      round him, even on his hearth. It made of his own child a greedy
      expectant, who measured every day and hour the lessening distance between
      his father and the grave, and cursed his tardy progress on that dismal
      road.&rsquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;No!&rsquo; cried Mr Pecksniff, boldly. &lsquo;Not at all, sir!&rsquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;But I saw that shadow in his house,&rsquo; said Martin Chuzzlewit, &lsquo;the last
      time we met, and warned him of its presence. I know it when I see it, do I
      not? I, who have lived within it all these years!&rsquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;I deny it,&rsquo; Mr Pecksniff answered, warmly. &lsquo;I deny it altogether. That
      bereaved young man is now in this house, sir, seeking in change of scene
      the peace of mind he has lost. Shall I be backward in doing justice to
      that young man, when even undertakers and coffin-makers have been moved by
      the conduct he has exhibited; when even mutes have spoken in his praise,
      and the medical man hasn&rsquo;t known what to do with himself in the excitement
      of his feelings! There is a person of the name of Gamp, sir&mdash;Mrs Gamp&mdash;ask
      her. She saw Mr Jonas in a trying time. Ask <i>her</i>, sir. She is respectable,
      but not sentimental, and will state the fact. A line addressed to Mrs
      Gamp, at the Bird Shop, Kingsgate Street, High Holborn, London, will meet
      with every attention, I have no doubt. Let her be examined, my good sir.
      Strike, but hear! Leap, Mr Chuzzlewit, but look! Forgive me, my dear sir,&rsquo;
      said Mr Pecksniff, taking both his hands, &lsquo;if I am warm; but I am honest,
      and must state the truth.&rsquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      In proof of the character he gave himself, Mr Pecksniff suffered tears of
      honesty to ooze out of his eyes.
    </p>
    <p>
      The old man gazed at him for a moment with a look of wonder, repeating to
      himself, &lsquo;Here now! In this house!&rsquo; But he mastered his surprise, and
      said, after a pause:
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Let me see him.&rsquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;In a friendly spirit, I hope?&rsquo; said Mr Pecksniff. &lsquo;Forgive me, sir but he
      is in the receipt of my humble hospitality.&rsquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;I said,&rsquo; replied the old man, &lsquo;let me see him. If I were disposed to
      regard him in any other than a friendly spirit, I should have said keep us
      apart.&rsquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Certainly, my dear sir. So you would. You are frankness itself, I know. I
      will break this happiness to him,&rsquo; said Mr Pecksniff, as he left the room,
      &lsquo;if you will excuse me for a minute&mdash;gently.&rsquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      He paved the way to the disclosure so very gently, that a quarter of an
      hour elapsed before he returned with Mr Jonas. In the meantime the young
      ladies had made their appearance, and the table had been set out for the
      refreshment of the travellers.
    </p>
    <p>
      Now, however well Mr Pecksniff, in his morality, had taught Jonas the
      lesson of dutiful behaviour to his uncle, and however perfectly Jonas, in
      the cunning of his nature, had learnt it, that young man&rsquo;s bearing, when
      presented to his father&rsquo;s brother, was anything but manly or engaging.
      Perhaps, indeed, so singular a mixture of defiance and obsequiousness, of
      fear and hardihood, of dogged sullenness and an attempt at enraging and
      propitiation, never was expressed in any one human figure as in that of
      Jonas, when, having raised his downcast eyes to Martin&rsquo;s face, he let them
      fall again, and uneasily closing and unclosing his hands without a
      moment&rsquo;s intermission, stood swinging himself from side to side, waiting
      to be addressed.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Nephew,&rsquo; said the old man. &lsquo;You have been a dutiful son, I hear.&rsquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;As dutiful as sons in general, I suppose,&rsquo; returned Jonas, looking up and
      down once more. &lsquo;I don&rsquo;t brag to have been any better than other sons; but
      I haven&rsquo;t been any worse, I dare say.&rsquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;A pattern to all sons, I am told,&rsquo; said the old man, glancing towards Mr
      Pecksniff.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Ecod!&rsquo; said Jonas, looking up again for a moment, and shaking his head,
      &lsquo;I&rsquo;ve been as good a son as ever you were a brother. It&rsquo;s the pot and the
      kettle, if you come to that.&rsquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;You speak bitterly, in the violence of your regret,&rsquo; said Martin, after a
      pause. &lsquo;Give me your hand.&rsquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      Jonas did so, and was almost at his ease. &lsquo;Pecksniff,&rsquo; he whispered, as
      they drew their chairs about the table; &lsquo;I gave him as good as he brought,
      eh? He had better look at home, before he looks out of window, I think?&rsquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      Mr Pecksniff only answered by a nudge of the elbow, which might either be
      construed into an indignant remonstrance or a cordial assent; but which,
      in any case, was an emphatic admonition to his chosen son-in-law to be
      silent. He then proceeded to do the honours of the house with his
      accustomed ease and amiability.
    </p>
    <p>
      But not even Mr Pecksniff&rsquo;s guileless merriment could set such a party at
      their ease, or reconcile materials so utterly discordant and conflicting
      as those with which he had to deal. The unspeakable jealously and hatred
      which that night&rsquo;s explanation had sown in Charity&rsquo;s breast, was not to be
      so easily kept down; and more than once it showed itself in such
      intensity, as seemed to render a full disclosure of all the circumstances
      then and there, impossible to be avoided. The beauteous Merry, too, with
      all the glory of her conquest fresh upon her, so probed and lanced the
      rankling disappointment of her sister by her capricious airs and thousand
      little trials of Mr Jonas&rsquo;s obedience, that she almost goaded her into a
      fit of madness, and obliged her to retire from table in a burst of
      passion, hardly less vehement than that to which she had abandoned herself
      in the first tumult of her wrath. The constraint imposed upon the family
      by the presence among them for the first time of Mary Graham (for by that
      name old Martin Chuzzlewit had introduced her) did not at all improve this
      state of things; gentle and quiet though her manner was. Mr Pecksniff&rsquo;s
      situation was peculiarly trying; for, what with having constantly to keep
      the peace between his daughters; to maintain a reasonable show of
      affection and unity in his household; to curb the growing ease and gaiety
      of Jonas, which vented itself in sundry insolences towards Mr Pinch, and
      an indefinable coarseness of manner in reference to Mary (they being the
      two dependants); to make no mention at all of his having perpetually to
      conciliate his rich old relative, and to smooth down, or explain away,
      some of the ten thousand bad appearances and combinations of bad
      appearances, by which they were surrounded on that unlucky evening&mdash;what
      with having to do this, and it would be difficult to sum up how much more,
      without the least relief or assistance from anybody, it may be easily
      imagined that Mr Pecksniff had in his enjoyment something more than that
      usual portion of alloy which is mixed up with the best of men&rsquo;s delights.
      Perhaps he had never in his life felt such relief as when old Martin,
      looking at his watch, announced that it was time to go.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;We have rooms,&rsquo; he said, &lsquo;at the Dragon, for the present. I have a fancy
      for the evening walk. The nights are dark just now; perhaps Mr Pinch would
      not object to light us home?&rsquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;My dear sir!&rsquo; cried Pecksniff, &lsquo;I shall be delighted. Merry, my child,
      the lantern.&rsquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;The lantern, if you please, my dear,&rsquo; said Martin; &lsquo;but I couldn&rsquo;t think
      of taking your father out of doors to-night; and, to be brief, I won&rsquo;t.&rsquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      Mr Pecksniff already had his hat in his hand, but it was so emphatically
      said that he paused.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;I take Mr Pinch, or go alone,&rsquo; said Martin. &lsquo;Which shall it be?&rsquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;It shall be Thomas, sir,&rsquo; cried Pecksniff, &lsquo;since you are so resolute
      upon it. Thomas, my friend, be very careful, if you please.&rsquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      Tom was in some need of this injunction, for he felt so nervous, and
      trembled to such a degree, that he found it difficult to hold the lantern.
      How much more difficult when, at the old man&rsquo;s bidding she drew her hand
      through his&mdash;Tom Pinch&rsquo;s&mdash;arm!
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;And so, Mr Pinch,&rsquo; said Martin, on the way, &lsquo;you are very comfortably
      situated here; are you?&rsquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      Tom answered, with even more than his usual enthusiasm, that he was under
      obligations to Mr Pecksniff which the devotion of a lifetime would but
      imperfectly repay.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;How long have you known my nephew?&rsquo; asked Martin.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Your nephew, sir?&rsquo; faltered Tom.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Mr Jonas Chuzzlewit,&rsquo; said Mary.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Oh dear, yes,&rsquo; cried Tom, greatly relieved, for his mind was running upon
      Martin. &lsquo;Certainly. I never spoke to him before to-night, sir!&rsquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Perhaps half a lifetime will suffice for the acknowledgment of <i>his</i>
      kindness,&rsquo; observed the old man.
    </p>
    <p>
      Tom felt that this was a rebuff for him, and could not but understand it
      as a left-handed hit at his employer. So he was silent. Mary felt that Mr
      Pinch was not remarkable for presence of mind, and that he could not say
      too little under existing circumstances. So <i>she </i>was silent. The old man,
      disgusted by what in his suspicious nature he considered a shameless and
      fulsome puff of Mr Pecksniff, which was a part of Tom&rsquo;s hired service and
      in which he was determined to persevere, set him down at once for a
      deceitful, servile, miserable fawner. So <i>he</i> was silent. And though they
      were all sufficiently uncomfortable, it is fair to say that Martin was
      perhaps the most so; for he had felt kindly towards Tom at first, and had
      been interested by his seeming simplicity.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;You&rsquo;re like the rest,&rsquo; he thought, glancing at the face of the
      unconscious Tom. &lsquo;You had nearly imposed upon me, but you have lost your
      labour. You are too zealous a toad-eater, and betray yourself, Mr Pinch.&rsquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      During the whole remainder of the walk, not another word was spoken. First
      among the meetings to which Tom had long looked forward with a beating
      heart, it was memorable for nothing but embarrassment and confusion. They
      parted at the Dragon door; and sighing as he extinguished the candle in
      the lantern, Tom turned back again over the gloomy fields.
    </p>
    <p>
      As he approached the first stile, which was in a lonely part, made very
      dark by a plantation of young firs, a man slipped past him and went on
      before. Coming to the stile he stopped, and took his seat upon it. Tom was
      rather startled, and for a moment stood still, but he stepped forward
      again immediately, and went close up to him.
    </p>
    <p>
      It was Jonas; swinging his legs to and fro, sucking the head of a stick,
      and looking with a sneer at Tom.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Good gracious me!&rsquo; cried Tom, &lsquo;who would have thought of its being you!
      You followed us, then?&rsquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;What&rsquo;s that to you?&rsquo; said Jonas. &lsquo;Go to the devil!&rsquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;You are not very civil, I think,&rsquo; remarked Tom.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Civil enough for <i>you</i>,&rsquo; retorted Jonas. &lsquo;Who are you?&rsquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;One who has as good a right to common consideration as another,&rsquo; said Tom
      mildly.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;You&rsquo;re a liar,&rsquo; said Jonas. &lsquo;You haven&rsquo;t a right to any consideration.
      You haven&rsquo;t a right to anything. You&rsquo;re a pretty sort of fellow to talk
      about your rights, upon my soul! Ha, ha!&mdash;Rights, too!&rsquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;If you proceed in this way,&rsquo; returned Tom, reddening, &lsquo;you will oblige me
      to talk about my wrongs. But I hope your joke is over.&rsquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;It&rsquo;s the way with you curs,&rsquo; said Mr Jonas, &lsquo;that when you know a man&rsquo;s
      in real earnest, you pretend to think he&rsquo;s joking, so that you may turn it
      off. But that won&rsquo;t do with me. It&rsquo;s too stale. Now just attend to me for
      a bit, Mr Pitch, or Witch, or Stitch, or whatever your name is.&rsquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;My name is Pinch,&rsquo; observed Tom. &lsquo;Have the goodness to call me by it.&rsquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;What! You mustn&rsquo;t even be called out of your name, mustn&rsquo;t you!&rsquo; cried
      Jonas. &lsquo;Pauper&rsquo; prentices are looking up, I think. Ecod, we manage &lsquo;em a
      little better in the city!&rsquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Never mind what you do in the city,&rsquo; said Tom. &lsquo;What have you got to say
      to me?&rsquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Just this, Mister Pinch,&rsquo; retorted Jonas, thrusting his face so close to
      Tom&rsquo;s that Tom was obliged to retreat a step. &lsquo;I advise you to keep your
      own counsel, and to avoid title-tattle, and not to cut in where you&rsquo;re not
      wanted. I&rsquo;ve heard something of you, my friend, and your meek ways; and I
      recommend you to forget &lsquo;em till I am married to one of Pecksniff&rsquo;s gals,
      and not to curry favour among my relations, but to leave the course clear.
      You know, when curs won&rsquo;t leave the course clear, they&rsquo;re whipped off; so
      this is kind advice. Do you understand? Eh? Damme, who are you,&rsquo; cried
      Jonas, with increased contempt, &lsquo;that you should walk home with <i>them</i>,
      unless it was behind &lsquo;em, like any other servant out of livery?&rsquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Come!&rsquo; cried Tom, &lsquo;I see that you had better get off the stile, and let
      me pursue my way home. Make room for me, if you please.&rsquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Don&rsquo;t think it!&rsquo; said Jonas, spreading out his legs. &lsquo;Not till I choose.
      And I don&rsquo;t choose now. What! You&rsquo;re afraid of my making you split upon
      some of your babbling just now, are you, Sneak?&rsquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;I am not afraid of many things, I hope,&rsquo; said Tom; &lsquo;and certainly not of
      anything that you will do. I am not a tale-bearer, and I despise all
      meanness. You quite mistake me. Ah!&rsquo; cried Tom, indignantly. &lsquo;Is this
      manly from one in your position to one in mine? Please to make room for me
      to pass. The less I say, the better.&rsquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;The less you say!&rsquo; retorted Jonas, dangling his legs the more, and taking
      no heed of this request. &lsquo;You say very little, don&rsquo;t you? Ecod, I should
      like to know what goes on between you and a vagabond member of my family.
      There&rsquo;s very little in that too, I dare say!&rsquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;I know no vagabond member of your family,&rsquo; cried Tom, stoutly.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;You do!&rsquo; said Jonas.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;I don&rsquo;t,&rsquo; said Tom. &lsquo;Your uncle&rsquo;s namesake, if you mean him, is no
      vagabond. Any comparison between you and him&rsquo;&mdash;Tom snapped his
      fingers at him, for he was rising fast in wrath&mdash;&lsquo;is immeasurably to
      your disadvantage.&rsquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Oh indeed!&rsquo; sneered Jonas. &lsquo;And what do you think of his deary&mdash;his
      beggarly leavings, eh, Mister Pinch?&rsquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;I don&rsquo;t mean to say another word, or stay here another instant,&rsquo; replied
      Tom.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;As I told you before, you&rsquo;re a liar,&rsquo; said Jonas, coolly. &lsquo;You&rsquo;ll stay
      here till I give you leave to go. Now, keep where you are, will you?&rsquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      He flourished his stick over Tom&rsquo;s head; but in a moment it was spinning
      harmlessly in the air, and Jonas himself lay sprawling in the ditch. In
      the momentary struggle for the stick, Tom had brought it into violent
      contact with his opponent&rsquo;s forehead; and the blood welled out profusely
      from a deep cut on the temple. Tom was first apprised of this by seeing
      that he pressed his handkerchief to the wounded part, and staggered as he
      rose, being stunned.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Are you hurt?&rsquo; said Tom. &lsquo;I am very sorry. Lean on me for a moment. You
      can do that without forgiving me, if you still bear me malice. But I don&rsquo;t
      know why; for I never offended you before we met on this spot.&rsquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      He made him no answer; not appearing at first to understand him, or even
      to know that he was hurt, though he several times took his handkerchief
      from the cut to look vacantly at the blood upon it. After one of these
      examinations, he looked at Tom, and then there was an expression in his
      features, which showed that he understood what had taken place, and would
      remember it.

    <p>
      Nothing more passed between them as they went home. Jonas kept a little in
      advance, and Tom Pinch sadly followed, thinking of the grief which the
      knowledge of this quarrel must occasion his excellent benefactor. When
      Jonas knocked at the door, Tom&rsquo;s heart beat high; higher when Miss Mercy
      answered it, and seeing her wounded lover, shireked aloud; higher, when he
      followed them into the family parlour; higher than at any other time, when
      Jonas spoke.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Don&rsquo;t make a noise about it,&rsquo; he said. &lsquo;It&rsquo;s nothing worth mentioning. I
      didn&rsquo;t know the road; the night&rsquo;s very dark; and just as I came up with Mr
      Pinch&rsquo;&mdash;he turned his face towards Tom, but not his eyes&mdash;&lsquo;I ran
      against a tree. It&rsquo;s only skin deep.&rsquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Cold water, Merry, my child!&rsquo; cried Mr Pecksniff. &lsquo;Brown paper! Scissors!
      A piece of old linen! Charity, my dear, make a bandage. Bless me, Mr
      Jonas!&rsquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Oh, bother <i>your </i>nonsense,&rsquo; returned the gracious son-in-law elect. &lsquo;Be of
      some use if you can. If you can&rsquo;t, get out!&rsquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      Miss Charity, though called upon to lend her aid, sat upright in one
      corner, with a smile upon her face, and didn&rsquo;t move a finger. Though Mercy
      laved the wound herself; and Mr Pecksniff held the patient&rsquo;s head between
      his two hands, as if without that assistance it must inevitably come in
      half; and Tom Pinch, in his guilty agitation, shook a bottle of Dutch
      Drops until they were nothing but English Froth, and in his other hand
      sustained a formidable carving-knife, really intended to reduce the
      swelling, but apparently designed for the ruthless infliction of another
      wound as soon as that was dressed; Charity rendered not the least
      assistance, nor uttered a word. But when Mr Jonas&rsquo;s head was bound up, and
      he had gone to bed, and everybody else had retired, and the house was
      quiet, Mr Pinch, as he sat mournfully on his bedstead, ruminating, heard a
      gentle tap at his door; and opening it, saw her, to his great
      astonishment, standing before him with her finger on her lip.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Mr Pinch,&rsquo; she whispered. &lsquo;Dear Mr Pinch! Tell me the truth! You did
      that? There was some quarrel between you, and you struck him? I am sure of
      it!&rsquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      It was the first time she had ever spoken kindly to Tom, in all the many
      years they had passed together. He was stupefied with amazement.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Was it so, or not?&rsquo; she eagerly demanded.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;I was very much provoked,&rsquo; said Tom.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Then it was?&rsquo; cried Charity, with sparkling eyes.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Ye-yes. We had a struggle for the path,&rsquo; said Tom. &lsquo;But I didn&rsquo;t mean to
      hurt him so much.&rsquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Not so much!&rsquo; she repeated, clenching her hand and stamping her foot, to
      Tom&rsquo;s great wonder. &lsquo;Don&rsquo;t say that. It was brave of you. I honour you for
      it. If you should ever quarrel again, don&rsquo;t spare him for the world, but
      beat him down and set your shoe upon him. Not a word of this to anybody.
      Dear Mr Pinch, I am your friend from tonight. I am always your friend from
      this time.&rsquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      She turned her flushed face upon Tom to confirm her words by its kindling
      expression; and seizing his right hand, pressed it to her breast, and
      kissed it. And there was nothing personal in this to render it at all
      embarrassing, for even Tom, whose power of observation was by no means
      remarkable, knew from the energy with which she did it that she would have
      fondled any hand, no matter how bedaubed or dyed, that had broken the head
      of Jonas Chuzzlewit.
    </p>
    <p>
      Tom went into his room, and went to bed, full of uncomfortable thoughts.
      That there should be any such tremendous division in the family as he knew
      must have taken place to convert Charity Pecksniff into his friend, for
      any reason, but, above all, for that which was clearly the real one; that
      Jonas, who had assailed him with such exceeding coarseness, should have
      been sufficiently magnanimous to keep the secret of their quarrel; and
      that any train of circumstances should have led to the commission of an
      assault and battery by Thomas Pinch upon any man calling himself the
      friend of Seth Pecksniff; were matters of such deep and painful cogitation
      that he could not close his eyes. His own violence, in particular, so
      preyed upon the generous mind of Tom, that coupling it with the many
      former occasions on which he had given Mr Pecksniff pain and anxiety
      (occasions of which that gentleman often reminded him), he really began to
      regard himself as destined by a mysterious fate to be the evil genius and
      bad angel of his patron. But he fell asleep at last, and dreamed&mdash;new
      source of waking uneasiness&mdash;that he had betrayed his trust, and run
      away with Mary Graham.
    </p>
    <p>
      It must be acknowledged that, asleep or awake, Tom&rsquo;s position in reference
      to this young lady was full of uneasiness. The more he saw of her, the
      more he admired her beauty, her intelligence, the amiable qualities that
      even won on the divided house of Pecksniff, and in a few days restored, at
      all events, the semblance of harmony and kindness between the angry
      sisters. When she spoke, Tom held his breath, so eagerly he listened; when
      she sang, he sat like one entranced. She touched his organ, and from that
      bright epoch even it, the old companion of his happiest hours, incapable
      as he had thought of elevation, began a new and deified existence.
    </p>
    <p>
      God&rsquo;s love upon thy patience, Tom! Who, that had beheld thee, for three
      summer weeks, poring through half the deadlong night over the jingling
      anatomy of that inscrutable old harpsichord in the back parlour, could
      have missed the entrance to thy secret heart: albeit it was dimly known to
      thee? Who that had seen the glow upon thy cheek when leaning down to
      listen, after hours of labour, for the sound of one incorrigible note,
      thou foundest that it had a voice at last, and wheezed out a flat
      something, distantly akin to what it ought to be, would not have known
      that it was destined for no common touch, but one that smote, though
      gently as an angel&rsquo;s hand, upon the deepest chord within thee! And if a
      friendly glance&mdash;aye, even though it were as guileless as thine own,
      Dear Tom&mdash;could have but pierced the twilight of that evening, when,
      in a voice well tempered to the time, sad, sweet, and low, yet hopeful,
      she first sang to the altered instrument, and wondered at the change; and
      thou, sitting apart at the open window, kept a glad silence and a swelling
      heart&mdash;must not that glance have read perforce the dawning of a
      story, Tom, that it were well for thee had never been begun!
    </p>
    <p>
      Tom Pinch&rsquo;s situation was not made the less dangerous or difficult by the
      fact of no one word passing between them in reference to Martin.
      Honourably mindful of his promise, Tom gave her opportunities of all
      kinds. Early and late he was in the church; in her favourite walks; in the
      village, in the garden, in the meadows; and in any or all of these places
      he might have spoken freely. But no; at all such times she carefully
      avoided him, or never came in his way unaccompanied. It could not be that
      she disliked or distrusted him, for by a thousand little delicate means,
      too slight for any notice but his own, she singled him out when others
      were present, and showed herself the very soul of kindness. Could it be
      that she had broken with Martin, or had never returned his affection, save
      in his own bold and heightened fancy? Tom&rsquo;s cheek grew red with
      self-reproach as he dismissed the thought.
    </p>
    <p>
      All this time old Martin came and went in his own strange manner, or sat
      among the rest absorbed within himself, and holding little intercourse
      with any one. Although he was unsocial, he was not willful in other
      things, or troublesome, or morose; being never better pleased than when
      they left him quite unnoticed at his book, and pursued their own
      amusements in his presence, unreserved. It was impossible to discern in
      whom he took an interest, or whether he had an interest in any of them.
      Unless they spoke to him directly, he never showed that he had ears or
      eyes for anything that passed.
    </p>
    <p>
      One day the lively Merry, sitting with downcast eyes under a shady tree in
      the churchyard, whither she had retired after fatiguing herself by the
      imposition of sundry trials on the temper of Mr Jonas, felt that a new
      shadow came between her and the sun. Raising her eyes in the expectation
      of seeing her betrothed, she was not a little surprised to see old Martin
      instead. Her surprise was not diminished when he took his seat upon the
      turf beside her, and opened a conversation thus:
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;When are you to be married?&rsquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Oh! dear Mr Chuzzlewit, my goodness me! I&rsquo;m sure I don&rsquo;t know. Not yet
      awhile, I hope.&rsquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;You hope?&rsquo; said the old man.
    </p>
    <p>
      It was very gravely said, but she took it for banter, and giggled
      excessively.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Come!&rsquo; said the old man, with unusual kindness, &lsquo;you are young,
      good-looking, and I think good-natured! Frivolous you are, and love to be,
      undoubtedly; but you must have some heart.&rsquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;I have not given it all away, I can tell you,&rsquo; said Merry, nodding her
      head shrewdly, and plucking up the grass.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Have you parted with any of it?&rsquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      She threw the grass about, and looked another way, but said nothing.
    </p>
    <p>
      Martin repeated his question.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Lor, my dear Mr Chuzzlewit! really you must excuse me! How very odd you
      are.&rsquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;If it be odd in me to desire to know whether you love the young man whom
      I understand you are to marry, I <i>am</i> very odd,&rsquo; said Martin. &lsquo;For that is
      certainly my wish.&rsquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;He&rsquo;s such a monster, you know,&rsquo; said Merry, pouting.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Then you don&rsquo;t love him?&rsquo; returned the old man. &lsquo;Is that your meaning?&rsquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Why, my dear Mr Chuzzlewit, I&rsquo;m sure I tell him a hundred times a day
      that I hate him. You must have heard me tell him that.&rsquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Often,&rsquo; said Martin.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;And so I do,&rsquo; cried Merry. &lsquo;I do positively.&rsquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Being at the same time engaged to marry him,&rsquo; observed the old man.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Oh yes,&rsquo; said Merry. &lsquo;But I told the wretch&mdash;my dear Mr Chuzzlewit,
      I told him when he asked me&mdash;that if I ever did marry him, it should
      only be that I might hate and tease him all my life.&rsquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      She had a suspicion that the old man regarded Jonas with anything but
      favour, and intended these remarks to be extremely captivating. He did not
      appear, however, to regard them in that light by any means; for when he
      spoke again, it was in a tone of severity.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Look about you,&rsquo; he said, pointing to the graves; &lsquo;and remember that from
      your bridal hour to the day which sees you brought as low as these, and
      laid in such a bed, there will be no appeal against him. Think, and speak,
      and act, for once, like an accountable creature. Is any control put upon
      your inclinations? Are you forced into this match? Are you insidiously
      advised or tempted to contract it, by any one? I will not ask by whom; by
      any one?&rsquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;No,&rsquo; said Merry, shrugging her shoulders. &lsquo;I don&rsquo;t know that I am.&rsquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Don&rsquo;t know that you are! Are you?&rsquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;No,&rsquo; replied Merry. &lsquo;Nobody ever said anything to me about it. If any one
      had tried to make me have him, I wouldn&rsquo;t have had him at all.&rsquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;I am told that he was at first supposed to be your sister&rsquo;s admirer,&rsquo;
      said Martin.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Oh, good gracious! My dear Mr Chuzzlewit, it would be very hard to make
      him, though he <i>is</i> a monster, accountable for other people&rsquo;s vanity,&rsquo; said
      Merry. &lsquo;And poor dear Cherry is the vainest darling!&rsquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;It was her mistake, then?&rsquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;I hope it was,&rsquo; cried Merry; &lsquo;but, all along, the dear child has been so
      dreadfully jealous, and <i>so</i> cross, that, upon my word and honour, it&rsquo;s
      impossible to please her, and it&rsquo;s of no use trying.&rsquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Not forced, persuaded, or controlled,&rsquo; said Martin, thoughtfully. &lsquo;And
      that&rsquo;s true, I see. There is one chance yet. You may have lapsed into this
      engagement in very giddiness. It may have been the wanton act of a light
      head. Is that so?&rsquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;My dear Mr Chuzzlewit,&rsquo; simpered Merry, &lsquo;as to light-headedness, there
      never was such a feather of a head as mine. It&rsquo;s perfect balloon, I
      declare! You never <i>did</i>, you know!&rsquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      He waited quietly till she had finished, and then said, steadily and
      slowly, and in a softened voice, as if he would still invite her
      confidence:
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Have you any wish&mdash;or is there anything within your breast that
      whispers you may form the wish, if you have time to think&mdash;to be
      released from this engagement?&rsquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      Again Miss Merry pouted, and looked down, and plucked the grass, and
      shrugged her shoulders. No. She didn&rsquo;t know that she had. She was pretty
      sure she hadn&rsquo;t. Quite sure, she might say. She &lsquo;didn&rsquo;t mind it.&rsquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Has it ever occurred to you,&rsquo; said Martin, &lsquo;that your married life may
      perhaps be miserable, full of bitterness, and most unhappy?&rsquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      Merry looked down again; and now she tore the grass up by the roots.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;My dear Mr Chuzzlewit, what shocking words! Of course, I shall quarrel
      with him. I should quarrel with any husband. Married people always
      quarrel, I believe. But as to being miserable, and bitter, and all those
      dreadful things, you know, why I couldn&rsquo;t be absolutely that, unless he
      always had the best of it; and I mean to have the best of it myself. I
      always do now,&rsquo; cried Merry, nodding her head and giggling very much; &lsquo;for
      I make a perfect slave of the creature.&rsquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Let it go on,&rsquo; said Martin, rising. &lsquo;Let it go on! I sought to know your
      mind, my dear, and you have shown it me. I wish you joy. Joy!&rsquo; he
      repeated, looking full upon her, and pointing to the wicket-gate where
      Jonas entered at the moment. And then, without waiting for his nephew, he
      passed out at another gate, and went away.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Oh, you terrible old man!&rsquo; cried the facetious Merry to herself. &lsquo;What a
      perfectly hideous monster to be wandering about churchyards in the broad
      daylight, frightening people out of their wits! Don&rsquo;t come here, Griffin,
      or I&rsquo;ll go away directly.&rsquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      Mr Jonas was the Griffin. He sat down upon the grass at her side, in spite
      of this warning, and sulkily inquired:
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;What&rsquo;s my uncle been a-talking about?&rsquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;About you,&rsquo; rejoined Merry. &lsquo;He says you&rsquo;re not half good enough for me.&rsquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Oh, yes, I dare say! We all know that. He means to give you some present
      worth having, I hope. Did he say anything that looked like it?&rsquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;<i>That </i>he didn&rsquo;t!&rsquo; cried Merry, most decisively.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;A stingy old dog he is,&rsquo; said Jonas. &lsquo;Well?&rsquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Griffin!&rsquo; cried Miss Mercy, in counterfeit amazement; &lsquo;what are you
      doing, Griffin?&rsquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Only giving you a squeeze,&rsquo; said the discomfited Jonas. &lsquo;There&rsquo;s no harm
      in that, I suppose?&rsquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;But there is great deal of harm in it, if I don&rsquo;t consider it agreeable,&rsquo;
      returned his cousin. &lsquo;Do go along, will you? You make me so hot!&rsquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      Mr Jonas withdrew his arm, and for a moment looked at her more like a
      murderer than a lover. But he cleared his brow by degrees, and broke
      silence with:
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;I say, Mel!&rsquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;What do you say, you vulgar thing&mdash;you low savage?&rsquo; cried his fair
      betrothed.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;When is it to be? I can&rsquo;t afford to go on dawdling about here half my
      life, I needn&rsquo;t tell you, and Pecksniff says that father&rsquo;s being so lately
      dead makes very little odds; for we can be married as quiet as we please
      down here, and my being lonely is a good reason to the neighbours for
      taking a wife home so soon, especially one that he knew. As to crossbones
      (my uncle, I mean), he&rsquo;s sure not to put a spoke in the wheel, whatever we
      settle on, for he told Pecksniff only this morning, that if <i>you </i>liked it
      he&rsquo;d nothing at all to say. So, Mel,&rsquo; said Jonas, venturing on another
      squeeze; &lsquo;when shall it be?&rsquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Upon my word!&rsquo; cried Merry.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Upon my soul, if you like,&rsquo; said Jonas. &lsquo;What do you say to next week,
      now?&rsquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;To next week! If you had said next quarter, I should have wondered at
      your impudence.&rsquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;But I didn&rsquo;t say next quarter,&rsquo; retorted Jonas. &lsquo;I said next week.&rsquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Then, Griffin,&rsquo; cried Miss Merry, pushing him off, and rising. &lsquo;I say no!
      not next week. It shan&rsquo;t be till I choose, and I may not choose it to be
      for months. There!&rsquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      He glanced up at her from the ground, almost as darkly as he had looked at
      Tom Pinch; but held his peace.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;No fright of a Griffin with a patch over his eye shall dictate to me or
      have a voice in the matter,&rsquo; said Merry. &lsquo;There!&rsquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      Still Mr Jonas held his peace.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;If it&rsquo;s next month, that shall be the very earliest; but I won&rsquo;t say when
      it shall be till to-morrow; and if you don&rsquo;t like that, it shall never be
      at all,&rsquo; said Merry; &lsquo;and if you follow me about and won&rsquo;t leave me alone,
      it shall never be at all. There! And if you don&rsquo;t do everything I order
      you to do, it shall never be at all. So don&rsquo;t follow me. There, Griffin!&rsquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      And with that, she skipped away, among the trees.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Ecod, my lady!&rsquo; said Jonas, looking after her, and biting a piece of
      straw, almost to powder; &lsquo;you&rsquo;ll catch it for this, when you <i>are </i>married.
      It&rsquo;s all very well now&mdash;it keeps one on, somehow, and you know it&mdash;but
      I&rsquo;ll pay you off scot and lot by-and-bye. This is a plaguey dull sort of a
      place for a man to be sitting by himself in. I never could abide a mouldy
      old churchyard.&rsquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      As he turned into the avenue himself, Miss Merry, who was far ahead,
      happened to look back.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Ah!&rsquo; said Jonas, with a sullen smile, and a nod that was not addressed to
      her. &lsquo;Make the most of it while it lasts. Get in your hay while the sun
      shines. Take your own way as long as it&rsquo;s in your power, my lady!&rsquo;
    </p>

    <h2>
      CHAPTER TWENTY-FIVE
    </h2>
    <p>
      IS IN PART PROFESSIONAL, AND FURNISHES THE READER WITH SOME VALUABLE HINTS
      IN RELATION TO THE MANAGEMENT OF A SICK CHAMBER
    </p>
    <p>
      Mr Mould was surrounded by his household gods. He was enjoying the sweets
      of domestic repose, and gazing on them with a calm delight. The day being
      sultry, and the window open, the legs of Mr Mould were on the window-seat,
      and his back reclined against the shutter. Over his shining head a
      handkerchief was drawn, to guard his baldness from the flies. The room was
      fragrant with the smell of punch, a tumbler of which grateful compound
      stood upon a small round table, convenient to the hand of Mr Mould; so
      deftly mixed that as his eye looked down into the cool transparent drink,
      another eye, peering brightly from behind the crisp lemon-peel, looked up
      at him, and twinkled like a star.
    </p>
    <p>
      Deep in the City, and within the ward of Cheap, stood Mr Mould&rsquo;s
      establishment. His Harem, or, in other words, the common sitting room of
      Mrs Mould and family, was at the back, over the little counting-house
      behind the shop; abutting on a churchyard small and shady. In this
      domestic chamber Mr Mould now sat; gazing, a placid man, upon his punch
      and home. If, for a moment at a time, he sought a wider prospect, whence
      he might return with freshened zest to these enjoyments, his moist glance
      wandered like a sunbeam through a rural screen of scarlet runners, trained
      on strings before the window, and he looked down, with an artist&rsquo;s eye,
      upon the graves.
    </p>
    <p>
      The partner of his life, and daughters twain, were Mr Mould&rsquo;s companions.
      Plump as any partridge was each Miss Mould, and Mrs M. was plumper than
      the two together. So round and chubby were their fair proportions, that
      they might have been the bodies once belonging to the angels&rsquo; faces in the
      shop below, grown up, with other heads attached to make them mortal. Even
      their peachy cheeks were puffed out and distended, as though they ought of
      right to be performing on celestial trumpets. The bodiless cherubs in the
      shop, who were depicted as constantly blowing those instruments for ever
      and ever without any lungs, played, it is to be presumed, entirely by ear.
    </p>
    <p>
      Mr Mould looked lovingly at Mrs Mould, who sat hard by, and was a helpmate
      to him in his punch as in all other things. Each seraph daughter, too,
      enjoyed her share of his regards, and smiled upon him in return. So
      bountiful were Mr Mould&rsquo;s possessions, and so large his stock in trade,
      that even there, within his household sanctuary, stood a cumbrous press,
      whose mahogany maw was filled with shrouds, and winding-sheets, and other
      furniture of funerals. But, though the Misses Mould had been brought up,
      as one may say, beneath his eye, it had cast no shadow on their timid
      infancy or blooming youth. Sporting behind the scenes of death and burial
      from cradlehood, the Misses Mould knew better. Hat-bands, to them, were
      but so many yards of silk or crape; the final robe but such a quantity of
      linen. The Misses Mould could idealise a player&rsquo;s habit, or a court-lady&rsquo;s
      petticoat, or even an act of parliament. But they were not to be taken in
      by palls. They made them sometimes.
    </p>
    <p>
      The premises of Mr Mould were hard of hearing to the boisterous noises in
      the great main streets, and nestled in a quiet corner, where the City
      strife became a drowsy hum, that sometimes rose and sometimes fell and
      sometimes altogether ceased; suggesting to a thoughtful mind a stoppage in
      Cheapside. The light came sparkling in among the scarlet runners, as if
      the churchyard winked at Mr Mould, and said, &lsquo;We understand each other;&rsquo;
      and from the distant shop a pleasant sound arose of coffin-making with a
      low melodious hammer, rat, tat, tat, tat, alike promoting slumber and
      digestion.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Quite the buzz of insects,&rsquo; said Mr Mould, closing his eyes in a perfect
      luxury. &lsquo;It puts one in mind of the sound of animated nature in the
      agricultural districts. It&rsquo;s exactly like the woodpecker tapping.&rsquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;The woodpecker tapping the hollow <i>Elm </i>tree,&rsquo; observed Mrs Mould, adapting
      the words of the popular melody to the description of wood commonly used
      in the trade.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Ha, ha!&rsquo; laughed Mr Mould. &lsquo;Not at all bad, my dear. We shall be glad to
      hear from you again, Mrs M. Hollow elm tree, eh! Ha, ha! Very good indeed.
      I&rsquo;ve seen worse than that in the Sunday papers, my love.&rsquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      Mrs Mould, thus encouraged, took a little more of the punch, and handed it
      to her daughters, who dutifully followed the example of their mother.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Hollow <i>Elm </i>tree, eh?&rsquo; said Mr Mould, making a slight motion with his legs
      in his enjoyment of the joke. &lsquo;It&rsquo;s beech in the song. Elm, eh? Yes, to be
      sure. Ha, ha, ha! Upon my soul, that&rsquo;s one of the best things I know?&rsquo; He
      was so excessively tickled by the jest that he couldn&rsquo;t forget it, but
      repeated twenty times, &lsquo;Elm, eh? Yes, to be sure. Elm, of course. Ha, ha,
      ha! Upon my life, you know, that ought to be sent to somebody who could
      make use of it. It&rsquo;s one of the smartest things that ever was said. Hollow
      <i>Elm </i>ree, eh? of course. Very hollow. Ha, ha, ha!&rsquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      Here a knock was heard at the room door.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;That&rsquo;s Tacker, I know,&rsquo; said Mrs Mould, &lsquo;by the wheezing he makes. Who
      that hears him now, would suppose he&rsquo;d ever had wind enough to carry the
      feathers on his head! Come in, Tacker.&rsquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Beg your pardon, ma&rsquo;am,&rsquo; said Tacker, looking in a little way. &lsquo;I thought
      our Governor was here.&rsquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Well! so he is,&rsquo; cried Mould.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Oh! I didn&rsquo;t see you, I&rsquo;m sure,&rsquo; said Tacker, looking in a little
      farther. &lsquo;You wouldn&rsquo;t be inclined to take a walking one of two, with the
      plain wood and a tin plate, I suppose?&rsquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Certainly not,&rsquo; replied Mr Mould, &lsquo;much too common. Nothing to say to
      it.&rsquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;I told &lsquo;em it was precious low,&rsquo; observed Mr Tacker.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Tell &lsquo;em to go somewhere else. We don&rsquo;t do that style of business here,&rsquo;
      said Mr Mould. &lsquo;Like their impudence to propose it. Who is it?&rsquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Why,&rsquo; returned Tacker, pausing, &lsquo;that&rsquo;s where it is, you see. It&rsquo;s the
      beadle&rsquo;s son-in-law.&rsquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;The beadle&rsquo;s son-in-law, eh?&rsquo; said Mould. &lsquo;Well! I&rsquo;ll do it if the beadle
      follows in his cocked hat; not else. We carry it off that way, by looking
      official, but it&rsquo;ll be low enough, then. His cocked hat, mind!&rsquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;I&rsquo;ll take care, sir,&rsquo; rejoined Tacker. &lsquo;Oh! Mrs Gamp&rsquo;s below, and wants
      to speak to you.&rsquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Tell Mrs Gamp to come upstairs,&rsquo; said Mould. &lsquo;Now Mrs Gamp, what&rsquo;s <i>your</i>
      news?&rsquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      The lady in question was by this time in the doorway, curtseying to Mrs
      Mould. At the same moment a peculiar fragrance was borne upon the breeze,
      as if a passing fairy had hiccoughed, and had previously been to a
      wine-vaults.
    </p>
    <p>
      Mrs Gamp made no response to Mr Mould, but curtseyed to Mrs Mould again,
      and held up her hands and eyes, as in a devout thanksgiving that she
      looked so well. She was neatly, but not gaudily attired, in the weeds she
      had worn when Mr Pecksniff had the pleasure of making her acquaintance;
      and was perhaps the turning of a scale more snuffy.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;There are some happy creeturs,&rsquo; Mrs Gamp observed, &lsquo;as time runs
      back&rsquo;ards with, and you are one, Mrs Mould; not that he need do nothing
      except use you in his most owldacious way for years to come, I&rsquo;m sure; for
      young you are and will be. I says to Mrs Harris,&rsquo; Mrs Gamp continued,
      &lsquo;only t&rsquo;other day; the last Monday evening fortnight as ever dawned upon
      this Piljian&rsquo;s Projiss of a mortal wale; I says to Mrs Harris when she
      says to me, &ldquo;Years and our trials, Mrs Gamp, sets marks upon us all.&rdquo;&mdash;&ldquo;Say
      not the words, Mrs Harris, if you and me is to be continual friends, for
      sech is not the case. Mrs Mould,&rdquo; I says, making so free, I will confess,
      as use the name,&rsquo; (she curtseyed here), &lsquo;&ldquo;is one of them that goes agen
      the obserwation straight; and never, Mrs Harris, whilst I&rsquo;ve a drop of
      breath to draw, will I set by, and not stand up, don&rsquo;t think it.&rdquo;&mdash;&ldquo;I
      ast your pardon, ma&rsquo;am,&rdquo; says Mrs Harris, &ldquo;and I humbly grant your grace;
      for if ever a woman lived as would see her feller creeturs into fits to
      serve her friends, well do I know that woman&rsquo;s name is Sairey Gamp.&rdquo;&rsquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      At this point she was fain to stop for breath; and advantage may be taken
      of the circumstance, to state that a fearful mystery surrounded this lady
      of the name of Harris, whom no one in the circle of Mrs Gamp&rsquo;s
      acquaintance had ever seen; neither did any human being know her place of
      residence, though Mrs Gamp appeared on her own showing to be in constant
      communication with her. There were conflicting rumours on the subject; but
      the prevalent opinion was that she was a phantom of Mrs Gamp&rsquo;s brain&mdash;as
      Messrs. Doe and Roe are fictions of the law&mdash;created for the express
      purpose of holding visionary dialogues with her on all manner of subjects,
      and invariably winding up with a compliment to the excellence of her
      nature.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;And likeways what a pleasure,&rsquo; said Mrs Gamp, turning with a tearful
      smile towards the daughters, &lsquo;to see them two young ladies as I know&rsquo;d
      afore a tooth in their pretty heads was cut, and have many a day seen&mdash;ah,
      the sweet creeturs!&mdash;playing at berryins down in the shop, and
      follerin&rsquo; the order-book to its long home in the iron safe! But that&rsquo;s all
      past and over, Mr Mould;&rsquo; as she thus got in a carefully regulated routine
      to that gentleman, she shook her head waggishly; &lsquo;That&rsquo;s all past and over
      now, sir, an&rsquo;t it?&rsquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Changes, Mrs Gamp, changes!&rsquo; returned the undertaker.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;More changes too, to come, afore we&rsquo;ve done with changes, sir,&rsquo; said Mrs
      Gamp, nodding yet more waggishly than before. &lsquo;Young ladies with such
      faces thinks of something else besides berryins, don&rsquo;t they, sir?&rsquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;I am sure I don&rsquo;t know, Mrs Gamp,&rsquo; said Mould, with a chuckle&mdash;&lsquo;Not
      bad in Mrs Gamp, my dear?&rsquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Oh yes, you do know, sir!&rsquo; said Mrs Gamp, &lsquo;and so does Mrs Mould, your
      &lsquo;ansome pardner too, sir; and so do I, although the blessing of a daughter
      was deniged me; which, if we had had one, Gamp would certainly have drunk
      its little shoes right off its feet, as with our precious boy he did, and
      arterward send the child a errand to sell his wooden leg for any money it
      would fetch as matches in the rough, and bring it home in liquor; which
      was truly done beyond his years, for ev&rsquo;ry individgle penny that child
      lost at toss or buy for kidney ones; and come home arterwards quite bold,
      to break the news, and offering to drown himself if sech would be a
      satisfaction to his parents.&mdash;Oh yes, you do know, sir,&rsquo; said Mrs
      Gamp, wiping her eye with her shawl, and resuming the thread of her
      discourse. &lsquo;There&rsquo;s something besides births and berryins in the
      newspapers, an&rsquo;t there, Mr Mould?&rsquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      Mr Mould winked at Mrs Mould, whom he had by this time taken on his knee,
      and said: &lsquo;No doubt. A good deal more, Mrs Gamp. Upon my life, Mrs Gamp is
      very far from bad, my dear!&rsquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;There&rsquo;s marryings, an&rsquo;t there, sir?&rsquo; said Mrs Gamp, while both the
      daughters blushed and tittered. &lsquo;Bless their precious hearts, and well
      they knows it! Well you know&rsquo;d it too, and well did Mrs Mould, when you
      was at their time of life! But my opinion is, you&rsquo;re all of one age now.
      For as to you and Mrs Mould, sir, ever having grandchildren&mdash;&rsquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Oh! Fie, fie! Nonsense, Mrs Gamp,&rsquo; replied the undertaker. &lsquo;Devilish
      smart, though. Ca-pi-tal!&rsquo;&mdash;this was in a whisper. &lsquo;My dear&rsquo;&mdash;aloud
      again&mdash;&lsquo;Mrs Gamp can drink a glass of rum, I dare say. Sit down, Mrs
      Gamp, sit down.&rsquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      Mrs Gamp took the chair that was nearest the door, and casting up her eyes
      towards the ceiling, feigned to be wholly insensible to the fact of a
      glass of rum being in preparation, until it was placed in her hand by one
      of the young ladies, when she exhibited the greatest surprise.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;A thing,&rsquo; she said, &lsquo;as hardly ever, Mrs Mould, occurs with me unless it
      is when I am indispoged, and find my half a pint of porter settling heavy
      on the chest. Mrs Harris often and often says to me, &ldquo;Sairey Gamp,&rdquo; she
      says, &ldquo;you raly do amaze me!&rdquo; &ldquo;Mrs Harris,&rdquo; I says to her, &ldquo;why so? Give
      it a name, I beg.&rdquo; &ldquo;Telling the truth then, ma&rsquo;am,&rdquo; says Mrs Harris, &ldquo;and
      shaming him as shall be nameless betwixt you and me, never did I think
      till I know&rsquo;d you, as any woman could sick-nurse and monthly likeways, on
      the little that you takes to drink.&rdquo; &ldquo;Mrs Harris,&rdquo; I says to her, &ldquo;none on
      us knows what we can do till we tries; and wunst, when me and Gamp kept
      &lsquo;ouse, I thought so too. But now,&rdquo; I says, &ldquo;my half a pint of porter fully
      satisfies; perwisin&rsquo;, Mrs Harris, that it is brought reg&rsquo;lar, and draw&rsquo;d
      mild. Whether I sicks or monthlies, ma&rsquo;am, I hope I does my duty, but I am
      but a poor woman, and I earns my living hard; therefore I <i>do</i> require it,
      which I makes confession, to be brought reg&rsquo;lar and draw&rsquo;d mild.&rdquo;&rsquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      The precise connection between these observations and the glass of rum,
      did not appear; for Mrs Gamp proposing as a toast &lsquo;The best of lucks to
      all!&rsquo; took off the dram in quite a scientific manner, without any further
      remarks.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;And what&rsquo;s your news, Mrs Gamp?&rsquo; asked Mould again, as that lady wiped
      her lips upon her shawl, and nibbled a corner off a soft biscuit, which
      she appeared to carry in her pocket as a provision against contingent
      drams. &lsquo;How&rsquo;s Mr Chuffey?&rsquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Mr Chuffey, sir,&rsquo; she replied, &lsquo;is jest as usual; he an&rsquo;t no better and
      he an&rsquo;t no worse. I take it very kind in the gentleman to have wrote up to
      you and said, &ldquo;let Mrs Gamp take care of him till I come home;&rdquo; but
      ev&rsquo;rythink he does is kind. There an&rsquo;t a many like him. If there was, we
      shouldn&rsquo;t want no churches.&rsquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;What do you want to speak to me about, Mrs Gamp?&rsquo; said Mould, coming to
      the point.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Jest this, sir,&rsquo; Mrs Gamp returned, &lsquo;with thanks to you for asking. There
      <i>is</i> a gent, sir, at the Bull in Holborn, as has been took ill there, and is
      bad abed. They have a day nurse as was recommended from Bartholomew&rsquo;s; and
      well I knows her, Mr Mould, her name bein&rsquo; Mrs Prig, the best of creeturs.
      But she is otherways engaged at night, and they are in wants of
      night-watching; consequent she says to them, having reposed the greatest
      friendliness in me for twenty year, &ldquo;The soberest person going, and the
      best of blessings in a sick room, is Mrs Gamp. Send a boy to Kingsgate
      Street,&rdquo; she says, &ldquo;and snap her up at any price, for Mrs Gamp is worth
      her weight and more in goldian guineas.&rdquo; My landlord brings the message
      down to me, and says, &ldquo;bein&rsquo; in a light place where you are, and this job
      promising so well, why not unite the two?&rdquo; &ldquo;No, sir,&rdquo; I says, &ldquo;not
      unbeknown to Mr Mould, and therefore do not think it. But I will go to Mr
      Mould,&rdquo; I says, &ldquo;and ast him, if you like.&rdquo;&rsquo; Here she looked sideways at
      the undertaker, and came to a stop.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Night-watching, eh?&rsquo; said Mould, rubbing his chin.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;From eight o&rsquo;clock till eight, sir. I will not deceive you,&rsquo; Mrs Gamp
      rejoined.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;And then go back, eh?&rsquo; said would.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Quite free, then, sir, to attend to Mr Chuffey. His ways bein&rsquo; quiet, and
      his hours early, he&rsquo;d be abed, sir, nearly all the time. I will not deny,&rsquo;
      said Mrs Gamp with meekness, &lsquo;that I am but a poor woman, and that the
      money is a object; but do not let that act upon you, Mr Mould. Rich folks
      may ride on camels, but it an&rsquo;t so easy for &lsquo;em to see out of a needle&rsquo;s
      eye. That is my comfort, and I hope I knows it.&rsquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Well, Mrs Gamp,&rsquo; observed Mould, &lsquo;I don&rsquo;t see any particular objection to
      your earning an honest penny under such circumstances. I should keep it
      quiet, I think, Mrs Gamp. I wouldn&rsquo;t mention it to Mr Chuzzlewit on his
      return, for instance, unless it were necessary, or he asked you
      pointblank.&rsquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;The very words was on my lips, sir,&rsquo; Mrs Gamp rejoined. &lsquo;Suppoging that
      the gent should die, I hope I might take the liberty of saying as I know&rsquo;d
      some one in the undertaking line, and yet give no offence to you, sir?&rsquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Certainly, Mrs Gamp,&rsquo; said Mould, with much condescension. &lsquo;You may
      casually remark, in such a case, that we do the thing pleasantly and in a
      great variety of styles, and are generally considered to make it as
      agreeable as possible to the feelings of the survivors. But don&rsquo;t obtrude
      it, don&rsquo;t obtrude it. Easy, easy! My dear, you may as well give Mrs Gamp a
      card or two, if you please.&rsquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      Mrs Gamp received them, and scenting no more rum in the wind (for the
      bottle was locked up again) rose to take her departure.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Wishing ev&rsquo;ry happiness to this happy family,&rsquo; said Mrs Gamp &lsquo;with all my
      heart. Good arternoon, Mrs Mould! If I was Mr would I should be jealous of
      you, ma&rsquo;am; and I&rsquo;m sure, if I was you, I should be jealous of Mr Mould.&rsquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Tut, tut! Bah, bah! Go along, Mrs Gamp!&rsquo; cried the delighted undertaker.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;As to the young ladies,&rsquo; said Mrs Gamp, dropping a curtsey, &lsquo;bless their
      sweet looks&mdash;how they can ever reconsize it with their duties to be
      so grown up with such young parents, it an&rsquo;t for sech as me to give a
      guess at.&rsquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Nonsense, nonsense. Be off, Mrs Gamp!&rsquo; cried Mould. But in the height of
      his gratification he actually pinched Mrs Mould as he said it.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;I&rsquo;ll tell you what, my dear,&rsquo; he observed, when Mrs Gamp had at last
      withdrawn and shut the door, &lsquo;that&rsquo;s a ve-ry shrewd woman. That&rsquo;s a woman
      whose intellect is immensely superior to her station in life. That&rsquo;s a
      woman who observes and reflects in an uncommon manner. She&rsquo;s the sort of
      woman now,&rsquo; said Mould, drawing his silk handkerchief over his head again,
      and composing himself for a nap &lsquo;one would almost feel disposed to bury
      for nothing; and do it neatly, too!&rsquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      Mrs Mould and her daughters fully concurred in these remarks; the subject
      of which had by this time reached the street, where she experienced so
      much inconvenience from the air, that she was obliged to stand under an
      archway for a short time, to recover herself. Even after this precaution,
      she walked so unsteadily as to attract the compassionate regards of divers
      kind-hearted boys, who took the liveliest interest in her disorder; and in
      their simple language bade her be of good cheer, for she was &lsquo;only a
      little screwed.&rsquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      Whatever she was, or whatever name the vocabulary of medical science would
      have bestowed upon her malady, Mrs Gamp was perfectly acquainted with the
      way home again; and arriving at the house of Anthony Chuzzlewit &amp; Son,
      lay down to rest. Remaining there until seven o&rsquo;clock in the evening, and
      then persuading poor old Chuffey to betake himself to bed, she sallied
      forth upon her new engagement. First, she went to her private lodgings in
      Kingsgate Street, for a bundle of robes and wrappings comfortable in the
      night season; and then repaired to the Bull in Holborn, which she reached
      as the clocks were striking eight.
    </p>
    <p>
      As she turned into the yard, she stopped; for the landlord, landlady, and
      head chambermaid, were all on the threshold together talking earnestly
      with a young gentleman who seemed to have just come or to be just going
      away. The first words that struck upon Mrs Gamp&rsquo;s ear obviously bore
      reference to the patient; and it being expedient that all good attendants
      should know as much as possible about the case on which their skill is
      brought to bear, Mrs Gamp listened as a matter of duty.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;No better, then?&rsquo; observed the gentleman.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Worse!&rsquo; said the landlord.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Much worse,&rsquo; added the landlady.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Oh! a deal badder,&rsquo; cried the chambermaid from the background, opening
      her eyes very wide, and shaking her head.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Poor fellow!&rsquo; said the gentleman, &lsquo;I am sorry to hear it. The worst of it
      is, that I have no idea what friends or relations he has, or where they
      live, except that it certainly is not in London.&rsquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      The landlord looked at the landlady; the landlady looked at the landlord;
      and the chambermaid remarked, hysterically, &lsquo;that of all the many wague
      directions she had ever seen or heerd of (and they wasn&rsquo;t few in an
      hotel), <i>that </i>was the waguest.&rsquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;The fact is, you see,&rsquo; pursued the gentleman, &lsquo;as I told you yesterday
      when you sent to me, I really know very little about him. We were
      school-fellows together; but since that time I have only met him twice. On
      both occasions I was in London for a boy&rsquo;s holiday (having come up for a
      week or so from Wiltshire), and lost sight of him again directly. The
      letter bearing my name and address which you found upon his table, and
      which led to your applying to me, is in answer, you will observe, to one
      he wrote from this house the very day he was taken ill, making an
      appointment with him at his own request. Here is his letter, if you wish
      to see it.&rsquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      The landlord read it; the landlady looked over him. The chambermaid, in
      the background, made out as much of it as she could, and invented the
      rest; believing it all from that time forth as a positive piece of
      evidence.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;He has very little luggage, you say?&rsquo; observed the gentleman, who was no
      other than our old friend, John Westlock.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Nothing but a portmanteau,&rsquo; said the landlord; &lsquo;and very little in it.&rsquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;A few pounds in his purse, though?&rsquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Yes. It&rsquo;s sealed up, and in the cash-box. I made a memorandum of the
      amount, which you&rsquo;re welcome to see.&rsquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Well!&rsquo; said John, &lsquo;as the medical gentleman says the fever must take its
      course, and nothing can be done just now beyond giving him his drinks
      regularly and having him carefully attended to, nothing more can be said
      that I know of, until he is in a condition to give us some information.
      Can you suggest anything else?&rsquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;N-no,&rsquo; replied the landlord, &lsquo;except&mdash;&rsquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Except, who&rsquo;s to pay, I suppose?&rsquo; said John.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Why,&rsquo; hesitated the landlord, &lsquo;it would be as well.&rsquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Quite as well,&rsquo; said the landlady.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Not forgetting to remember the servants,&rsquo; said the chambermaid in a bland
      whisper.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;It is but reasonable, I fully admit,&rsquo; said John Westlock. &lsquo;At all events,
      you have the stock in hand to go upon for the present; and I will readily
      undertake to pay the doctor and the nurses.&rsquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Ah!&rsquo; cried Mrs Gamp. &lsquo;A rayal gentleman!&rsquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      She groaned her admiration so audibly, that they all turned round. Mrs
      Gamp felt the necessity of advancing, bundle in hand, and introducing
      herself.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;The night-nurse,&rsquo; she observed, &lsquo;from Kingsgate Street, well beknown to
      Mrs Prig the day-nurse, and the best of creeturs. How is the poor dear
      gentleman to-night? If he an&rsquo;t no better yet, still that is what must be
      expected and prepared for. It an&rsquo;t the fust time by a many score, ma&rsquo;am,&rsquo;
      dropping a curtsey to the landlady, &lsquo;that Mrs Prig and me has nussed
      together, turn and turn about, one off, one on. We knows each other&rsquo;s
      ways, and often gives relief when others fail. Our charges is but low,
      sir&rsquo;&mdash;Mrs Gamp addressed herself to John on this head&mdash;&lsquo;considerin&rsquo;
      the nater of our painful dooty. If they wos made accordin&rsquo; to our wishes,
      they would be easy paid.&rsquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      Regarding herself as having now delivered her inauguration address, Mrs
      Gamp curtseyed all round, and signified her wish to be conducted to the
      scene of her official duties. The chambermaid led her, through a variety
      of intricate passages, to the top of the house; and pointing at length to
      a solitary door at the end of a gallery, informed her that yonder was the
      chamber where the patient lay. That done, she hurried off with all the
      speed she could make.
    </p>
    <p>
      Mrs Gamp traversed the gallery in a great heat from having carried her
      large bundle up so many stairs, and tapped at the door which was
      immediately opened by Mrs Prig, bonneted and shawled and all impatience to
      be gone. Mrs Prig was of the Gamp build, but not so fat; and her voice was
      deeper and more like a man&rsquo;s. She had also a beard.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;I began to think you warn&rsquo;t a-coming!&rsquo; Mrs Prig observed, in some
      displeasure.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;It shall be made good to-morrow night,&rsquo; said Mrs Gamp &lsquo;Honorable. I had
      to go and fetch my things.&rsquo; She had begun to make signs of inquiry in
      reference to the position of the patient and his overhearing them&mdash;for
      there was a screen before the door&mdash;when Mrs Prig settled that point
      easily.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Oh!&rsquo; she said aloud, &lsquo;he&rsquo;s quiet, but his wits is gone. It an&rsquo;t no matter
      wot you say.&rsquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Anythin&rsquo; to tell afore you goes, my dear?&rsquo; asked Mrs Gamp, setting her
      bundle down inside the door, and looking affectionately at her partner.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;The pickled salmon,&rsquo; Mrs Prig replied, &lsquo;is quite delicious. I can
      partlck&rsquo;ler recommend it. Don&rsquo;t have nothink to say to the cold meat, for
      it tastes of the stable. The drinks is all good.&rsquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      Mrs Gamp expressed herself much gratified.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;The physic and them things is on the drawers and mankleshelf,&rsquo; said Mrs
      Prig, cursorily. &lsquo;He took his last slime draught at seven. The easy-chair
      an&rsquo;t soft enough. You&rsquo;ll want his piller.&rsquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      Mrs Gamp thanked her for these hints, and giving her a friendly good
      night, held the door open until she had disappeared at the other end of
      the gallery. Having thus performed the hospitable duty of seeing her
      safely off, she shut it, locked it on the inside, took up her bundle,
      walked round the screen, and entered on her occupation of the sick
      chamber.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;A little dull, but not so bad as might be,&rsquo; Mrs Gamp remarked. &lsquo;I&rsquo;m glad
      to see a parapidge, in case of fire, and lots of roofs and chimley-pots to
      walk upon.&rsquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      It will be seen from these remarks that Mrs Gamp was looking out of
      window. When she had exhausted the prospect, she tried the easy-chair,
      which she indignantly declared was &lsquo;harder than a brickbadge.&rsquo; Next she
      pursued her researches among the physic-bottles, glasses, jugs, and
      tea-cups; and when she had entirely satisfied her curiosity on all these
      subjects of investigation, she untied her bonnet-strings and strolled up
      to the bedside to take a look at the patient.
    </p>
    <p>
      A young man&mdash;dark and not ill-looking&mdash;with long black hair,
      that seemed the blacker for the whiteness of the bed-clothes. His eyes
      were partly open, and he never ceased to roll his head from side to side
      upon the pillow, keeping his body almost quiet. He did not utter words;
      but every now and then gave vent to an expression of impatience or
      fatigue, sometimes of surprise; and still his restless head&mdash;oh,
      weary, weary hour!&mdash;went to and fro without a moment&rsquo;s intermission.
    </p>
    <p>
      Mrs Gamp solaced herself with a pinch of snuff, and stood looking at him
      with her head inclined a little sideways, as a connoisseur might gaze upon
      a doubtful work of art. By degrees, a horrible remembrance of one branch
      of her calling took possession of the woman; and stooping down, she pinned
      his wandering arms against his sides, to see how he would look if laid out
      as a dead man. Her fingers itched to compose his limbs in that last marble
      attitude.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Ah!&rsquo; said Mrs Gamp, walking away from the bed, &lsquo;he&rsquo;d make a lovely
      corpse.&rsquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      She now proceeded to unpack her bundle; lighted a candle with the aid of a
      fire-box on the drawers; filled a small kettle, as a preliminary to
      refreshing herself with a cup of tea in the course of the night; laid what
      she called &lsquo;a little bit of fire,&rsquo; for the same philanthropic purpose; and
      also set forth a small tea-board, that nothing might be wanting for her
      comfortable enjoyment. These preparations occupied so long, that when they
      were brought to a conclusion it was high time to think about supper; so
      she rang the bell and ordered it.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;I think, young woman,&rsquo; said Mrs Gamp to the assistant chambermaid, in a
      tone expressive of weakness, &lsquo;that I could pick a little bit of pickled
      salmon, with a nice little sprig of fennel, and a sprinkling of white
      pepper. I takes new bread, my dear, with just a little pat of fresh
      butter, and a mossel of cheese. In case there should be such a thing as a
      cowcumber in the &lsquo;ouse, will you be so kind as bring it, for I&rsquo;m rather
      partial to &lsquo;em, and they does a world of good in a sick room. If they
      draws the Brighton Old Tipper here, I takes <i>that </i>ale at night, my love, it
      bein&rsquo; considered wakeful by the doctors. And whatever you do, young woman,
      don&rsquo;t bring more than a shilling&rsquo;s-worth of gin and water-warm when I
      rings the bell a second time; for that is always my allowance, and I never
      takes a drop beyond!&rsquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      Having preferred these moderate requests, Mrs Gamp observed that she would
      stand at the door until the order was executed, to the end that the
      patient might not be disturbed by her opening it a second time; and
      therefore she would thank the young woman to &lsquo;look sharp.&rsquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      A tray was brought with everything upon it, even to the cucumber and Mrs
      Gamp accordingly sat down to eat and drink in high good humour. The extent
      to which she availed herself of the vinegar, and supped up that refreshing
      fluid with the blade of her knife, can scarcely be expressed in narrative.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Ah!&rsquo; sighed Mrs Gamp, as she meditated over the warm shilling&rsquo;s-worth,
      &lsquo;what a blessed thing it is&mdash;living in a wale&mdash;to be contented!
      What a blessed thing it is to make sick people happy in their beds, and
      never mind one&rsquo;s self as long as one can do a service! I don&rsquo;t believe a
      finer cowcumber was ever grow&rsquo;d. I&rsquo;m sure I never see one!&rsquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      She moralised in the same vein until her glass was empty, and then
      administered the patient&rsquo;s medicine, by the simple process of clutching
      his windpipe to make him gasp, and immediately pouring it down his throat.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;I a&rsquo;most forgot the piller, I declare!&rsquo; said Mrs Gamp, drawing it away.
      &lsquo;There! Now he&rsquo;s comfortable as he can be, I&rsquo;m sure! I must try to make
      myself as much so as I can.&rsquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      With this view, she went about the construction of an extemporaneous bed
      in the easy-chair, with the addition of the next easy one for her feet.
      Having formed the best couch that the circumstances admitted of, she took
      out of her bundle a yellow night-cap, of prodigious size, in shape
      resembling a cabbage; which article of dress she fixed and tied on with
      the utmost care, previously divesting herself of a row of bald old curls
      that could scarcely be called false, they were so very innocent of
      anything approaching to deception. From the same repository she brought
      forth a night-jacket, in which she also attired herself. Finally, she
      produced a watchman&rsquo;s coat which she tied round her neck by the sleeves,
      so that she become two people; and looked, behind, as if she were in the
      act of being embraced by one of the old patrol.
    </p>
    <p>
      All these arrangements made, she lighted the rush-light, coiled herself up
      on her couch, and went to sleep. Ghostly and dark the room became, and
      full of lowering shadows. The distant noises in the streets were gradually
      hushed; the house was quiet as a sepulchre; the dead of night was coffined
      in the silent city.
    </p>
    <p>
      Oh, weary, weary hour! Oh, haggard mind, groping darkly through the past;
      incapable of detaching itself from the miserable present; dragging its
      heavy chain of care through imaginary feasts and revels, and scenes of
      awful pomp; seeking but a moment&rsquo;s rest among the long-forgotten haunts of
      childhood, and the resorts of yesterday; and dimly finding fear and horror
      everywhere! Oh, weary, weary hour! What were the wanderings of Cain, to
      these!
    </p>
    <p>
      Still, without a moment&rsquo;s interval, the burning head tossed to and fro.
      Still, from time to time, fatigue, impatience, suffering, and surprise,
      found utterance upon that rack, and plainly too, though never once in
      words. At length, in the solemn hour of midnight, he began to talk;
      waiting awfully for answers sometimes; as though invisible companions were
      about his bed; and so replying to their speech and questioning again.
    </p>
    <p>
      Mrs Gamp awoke, and sat up in her bed; presenting on the wall the shadow
      of a gigantic night constable, struggling with a prisoner.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Come! Hold your tongue!&rsquo; she cried, in sharp reproof. &lsquo;Don&rsquo;t make none of
      that noise here.&rsquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      There was no alteration in the face, or in the incessant motion of the
      head, but he talked on wildly.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Ah!&rsquo; said Mrs Gamp, coming out of the chair with an impatient shiver; &lsquo;I
      thought I was a-sleepin&rsquo; too pleasant to last! The devil&rsquo;s in the night, I
      think, it&rsquo;s turned so chilly!&rsquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Don&rsquo;t drink so much!&rsquo; cried the sick man. &lsquo;You&rsquo;ll ruin us all. Don&rsquo;t you
      see how the fountain sinks? Look at the mark where the sparkling water was
      just now!&rsquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Sparkling water, indeed!&rsquo; said Mrs Gamp. &lsquo;I&rsquo;ll have a sparkling cup o&rsquo;
      tea, I think. I wish you&rsquo;d hold your noise!&rsquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      He burst into a laugh, which, being prolonged, fell off into a dismal
      wail. Checking himself, with fierce inconstancy he began to count&mdash;fast.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;One&mdash;two&mdash;three&mdash;four&mdash;five&mdash;six.&rsquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;One, two, buckle my shoe,&rdquo;&rsquo; said Mrs Gamp, who was now on her knees,
      lighting the fire, &ldquo;three, four, shut the door,&rdquo;&mdash;I wish you&rsquo;d shut
      your mouth, young man&mdash;&ldquo;five, six, picking up sticks.&rdquo; If I&rsquo;d got a
      few handy, I should have the kettle boiling all the sooner.&rsquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      Awaiting this desirable consummation, she sat down so close to the fender
      (which was a high one) that her nose rested upon it; and for some time she
      drowsily amused herself by sliding that feature backwards and forwards
      along the brass top, as far as she could, without changing her position to
      do it. She maintained, all the while, a running commentary upon the
      wanderings of the man in bed.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;That makes five hundred and twenty-one men, all dressed alike, and with
      the same distortion on their faces, that have passed in at the window, and
      out at the door,&rsquo; he cried, anxiously. &lsquo;Look there! Five hundred and
      twenty-two&mdash;twenty-three&mdash;twenty-four. Do you see them?&rsquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Ah! I see &lsquo;em,&rsquo; said Mrs Gamp; &lsquo;all the whole kit of &lsquo;em numbered like
      hackney-coaches, an&rsquo;t they?&rsquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Touch me! Let me be sure of this. Touch me!&rsquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;You&rsquo;ll take your next draught when I&rsquo;ve made the kettle bile,&rsquo; retorted
      Mrs Gamp, composedly, &lsquo;and you&rsquo;ll be touched then. You&rsquo;ll be touched up,
      too, if you don&rsquo;t take it quiet.&rsquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Five hundred and twenty-eight, five hundred and twenty-nine, five hundred
      and thirty.&mdash;Look here!&rsquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;What&rsquo;s the matter now?&rsquo; said Mrs Gamp.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;They&rsquo;re coming four abreast, each man with his arm entwined in the next
      man&rsquo;s, and his hand upon his shoulder. What&rsquo;s that upon the arm of every
      man, and on the flag?&rsquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Spiders, p&rsquo;raps,&rsquo; said Mrs Gamp.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Crape! Black crape! Good God! why do they wear it outside?&rsquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Would you have &lsquo;em carry black crape in their insides?&rsquo; Mrs Gamp
      retorted. &lsquo;Hold your noise, hold your noise.&rsquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      The fire beginning by this time to impart a grateful warmth, Mrs Gamp
      became silent; gradually rubbed her nose more and more slowly along the
      top of the fender; and fell into a heavy doze. She was awakened by the
      room ringing (as she fancied) with a name she knew:
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Chuzzlewit!&rsquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      The sound was so distinct and real, and so full of agonised entreaty, that
      Mrs Gamp jumped up in terror, and ran to the door. She expected to find
      the passage filled with people, come to tell her that the house in the
      city had taken fire. But the place was empty; not a soul was there. She
      opened the window, and looked out. Dark, dull, dingy, and desolate
      house-tops. As she passed to her seat again, she glanced at the patient.
      Just the same; but silent. Mrs Gamp was so warm now, that she threw off
      the watchman&rsquo;s coat, and fanned herself.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;It seemed to make the wery bottles ring,&rsquo; she said. &lsquo;What could I have
      been a-dreaming of? That dratted Chuffey, I&rsquo;ll be bound.&rsquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      The supposition was probable enough. At any rate, a pinch of snuff, and
      the song of the steaming kettle, quite restored the tone of Mrs Gamp&rsquo;s
      nerves, which were none of the weakest. She brewed her tea; made some
      buttered toast; and sat down at the tea-board, with her face to the fire.
    </p>
    <p>
      When once again, in a tone more terrible than that which had vibrated in
      her slumbering ear, these words were shrieked out:
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Chuzzlewit! Jonas! No!&rsquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      Mrs Gamp dropped the cup she was in the act of raising to her lips, and
      turned round with a start that made the little tea-board leap. The cry had
      come from the bed.
    </p>
    <p>
      It was bright morning the next time Mrs Gamp looked out of the window, and
      the sun was rising cheerfully. Lighter and lighter grew the sky, and
      noisier the streets; and high into the summer air uprose the smoke of
      newly kindled fires, until the busy day was broad awake.
    </p>
    <p>
      Mrs Prig relieved punctually, having passed a good night at her other
      patient&rsquo;s. Mr Westlock came at the same time, but he was not admitted, the
      disorder being infectious. The doctor came too. The doctor shook his head.
      It was all he could do, under the circumstances, and he did it well.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;What sort of a night, nurse?&rsquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Restless, sir,&rsquo; said Mrs Gamp.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Talk much?&rsquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Middling, sir,&rsquo; said Mrs Gamp.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Nothing to the purpose, I suppose?&rsquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Oh bless you, no, sir. Only jargon.&rsquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Well!&rsquo; said the doctor, &lsquo;we must keep him quiet; keep the room cool; give
      him his draughts regularly; and see that he&rsquo;s carefully looked to. That&rsquo;s
      all!&rsquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;And as long as Mrs Prig and me waits upon him, sir, no fear of that,&rsquo;
      said Mrs Gamp.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;I suppose,&rsquo; observed Mrs Prig, when they had curtseyed the doctor out;
      &lsquo;there&rsquo;s nothin&rsquo; new?&rsquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Nothin&rsquo; at all, my dear,&rsquo; said Mrs Gamp. &lsquo;He&rsquo;s rather wearin&rsquo; in his talk
      from making up a lot of names; elseways you needn&rsquo;t mind him.&rsquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Oh, I shan&rsquo;t mind him,&rsquo; Mrs Prig returned. &lsquo;I have somethin&rsquo; else to
      think of.&rsquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;I pays my debts to-night, you know, my dear, and comes afore my time,&rsquo;
      said Mrs Gamp. &lsquo;But, Betsy Prig&rsquo;&mdash;speaking with great feeling, and
      laying her hand upon her arm&mdash;&lsquo;try the cowcumbers, God bless you!&rsquo;

      CHAPTER TWENTY-SIX
    </h2>
    <h3>
      AN UNEXPECTED MEETING, AND A PROMISING PROSPECT
    </h3>
    <p>
      The laws of sympathy between beards and birds, and the secret source of
      that attraction which frequently impels a shaver of the one to be a dealer
      in the other, are questions for the subtle reasoning of scientific bodies;
      not the less so, because their investigation would seem calculated to lead
      to no particular result. It is enough to know that the artist who had the
      honour of entertaining Mrs Gamp as his first-floor lodger, united the two
      pursuits of barbering and bird-fancying; and that it was not an original
      idea of his, but one in which he had, dispersed about the by-streets and
      suburbs of the town, a host of rivals.
    </p>
    <p>
      The name of the householder was Paul Sweedlepipe. But he was commonly
      called Poll Sweedlepipe; and was not uncommonly believed to have been so
      christened, among his friends and neighbours.
    </p>
    <p>
      With the exception of the staircase, and his lodger&rsquo;s private apartment,
      Poll Sweedlepipe&rsquo;s house was one great bird&rsquo;s nest. Gamecocks resided in
      the kitchen; pheasants wasted the brightness of their golden plumage on
      the garret; bantams roosted in the cellar; owls had possession of the
      bedroom; and specimens of all the smaller fry of birds chirrupped and
      twittered in the shop. The staircase was sacred to rabbits. There in
      hutches of all shapes and kinds, made from old packing-cases, boxes,
      drawers, and tea-chests, they increased in a prodigious degree, and
      contributed their share towards that complicated whiff which, quite
      impartially, and without distinction of persons, saluted every nose that
      was put into Sweedlepipe&rsquo;s easy shaving-shop.
    </p>
    <p>
      Many noses found their way there, for all that, especially on Sunday
      morning, before church-time. Even archbishops shave, or must be shaved, on
      a Sunday, and beards <i>will </i>grow after twelve o&rsquo;clock on Saturday night,
      though it be upon the chins of base mechanics; who, not being able to
      engage their valets by the quarter, hire them by the job, and pay them&mdash;oh,
      the wickedness of copper coin!&mdash;in dirty pence. Poll Sweedlepipe, the
      sinner, shaved all comers at a penny each, and cut the hair of any
      customer for twopence; and being a lone unmarried man, and having some
      connection in the bird line, Poll got on tolerably well.
    </p>
    <p>
      He was a little elderly man, with a clammy cold right hand, from which
      even rabbits and birds could not remove the smell of shaving-soap. Poll
      had something of the bird in his nature; not of the hawk or eagle, but of
      the sparrow, that builds in chimney-stacks and inclines to human company.
      He was not quarrelsome, though, like the sparrow; but peaceful, like the
      dove. In his walk he strutted; and, in this respect, he bore a faint
      resemblance to the pigeon, as well as in a certain prosiness of speech,
      which might, in its monotony, be likened to the cooing of that bird. He
      was very inquisitive; and when he stood at his shop-door in the
      evening-tide, watching the neighbours, with his head on one side, and his
      eye cocked knowingly, there was a dash of the raven in him. Yet there was
      no more wickedness in Poll than in a robin. Happily, too, when any of his
      ornithological properties were on the verge of going too far, they were
      quenched, dissolved, melted down, and neutralised in the barber; just as
      his bald head&mdash;otherwise, as the head of a shaved magpie&mdash;lost
      itself in a wig of curly black ringlets, parted on one side, and cut away
      almost to the crown, to indicate immense capacity of intellect.
    </p>
    <p>
      Poll had a very small, shrill treble voice, which might have led the wags
      of Kingsgate Street to insist the more upon his feminine designation. He
      had a tender heart, too; for, when he had a good commission to provide
      three or four score sparrows for a shooting-match, he would observe, in a
      compassionate tone, how singular it was that sparrows should have been
      made expressly for such purposes. The question, whether men were made to
      shoot them, never entered into Poll&rsquo;s philosophy.
    </p>
    <p>
      Poll wore, in his sporting character, a velveteen coat, a great deal of
      blue stocking, ankle boots, a neckerchief of some bright colour, and a
      very tall hat. Pursuing his more quiet occupation of barber, he generally
      subsided into an apron not over-clean, a flannel jacket, and corduroy
      knee-shorts. It was in this latter costume, but with his apron girded
      round his waist, as a token of his having shut up shop for the night, that
      he closed the door one evening, some weeks after the occurrences detailed
      in the last chapter, and stood upon the steps in Kingsgate Street,
      listening until the little cracked bell within should leave off ringing.
      For until it did&mdash;this was Mr Sweedlepipe&rsquo;s reflection&mdash;the
      place never seemed quiet enough to be left to itself.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;It&rsquo;s the greediest little bell to ring,&rsquo; said Poll, &lsquo;that ever was. But
      it&rsquo;s quiet at last.&rsquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      He rolled his apron up a little tighter as he said these words, and
      hastened down the street. Just as he was turning into Holborn, he ran
      against a young gentleman in a livery. This youth was bold, though small,
      and with several lively expressions of displeasure, turned upon him
      instantly.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Now, <i>stoo-pid</i>!&rsquo; cried the young gentleman. &lsquo;Can&rsquo;t you look where you&rsquo;re
      a-going to&mdash;eh? Can&rsquo;t you mind where you&rsquo;re a-coming to&mdash;eh?
      What do you think your eyes was made for&mdash;eh? Ah! Yes. Oh! Now then!&rsquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      The young gentleman pronounced the two last words in a very loud tone and
      with frightful emphasis, as though they contained within themselves the
      essence of the direst aggravation. But he had scarcely done so, when his
      anger yielded to surprise, and he cried, in a milder tone:
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;What! Polly!&rsquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Why, it an&rsquo;t you, sure!&rsquo; cried Poll. &lsquo;It can&rsquo;t be you!&rsquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;No. It an&rsquo;t me,&rsquo; returned the youth. &lsquo;It&rsquo;s my son, my oldest one. He&rsquo;s a
      credit to his father, an&rsquo;t he, Polly?&rsquo; With this delicate little piece of
      banter, he halted on the pavement, and went round and round in circles,
      for the better exhibition of his figure; rather to the inconvenience of
      the passengers generally, who were not in an equal state of spirits with
      himself.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;I wouldn&rsquo;t have believed it,&rsquo; said Poll. &lsquo;What! You&rsquo;ve left your old
      place, then? Have you?&rsquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Have I!&rsquo; returned his young friend, who had by this time stuck his hands
      into the pockets of his white cord breeches, and was swaggering along at
      the barber&rsquo;s side. &lsquo;D&rsquo;ye know a pair of top-boots when you see &lsquo;em, Polly?&mdash;look
      here!&rsquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Beau-ti-ful&rsquo; cried Mr Sweedlepipe.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;D&rsquo;ye know a slap-up sort of button, when you see it?&rsquo; said the youth.
      &lsquo;Don&rsquo;t look at mine, if you ain&rsquo;t a judge, because these lions&rsquo; heads was
      made for men of taste; not snobs.&rsquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Beau-ti-ful!&rsquo; cried the barber again. &lsquo;A grass-green frock-coat, too,
      bound with gold; and a cockade in your hat!&rsquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;I should hope so,&rsquo; replied the youth. &lsquo;Blow the cockade, though; for,
      except that it don&rsquo;t turn round, it&rsquo;s like the wentilator that used to be
      in the kitchen winder at Todgers&rsquo;s. You ain&rsquo;t seen the old lady&rsquo;s name in
      the Gazette, have you?&rsquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;No,&rsquo; returned the barber. &lsquo;Is she a bankrupt?&rsquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;If she ain&rsquo;t, she will be,&rsquo; retorted Bailey. &lsquo;That bis&rsquo;ness never can be
      carried on without <i>me</i>. Well! How are you?&rsquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Oh! I&rsquo;m pretty well,&rsquo; said Poll. &lsquo;Are you living at this end of the town,
      or were you coming to see me? Was that the bis&rsquo;ness that brought you to
      Holborn?&rsquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;I haven&rsquo;t got no bis&rsquo;ness in Holborn,&rsquo; returned Bailey, with some
      displeasure. &lsquo;All my bis&rsquo;ness lays at the West End. I&rsquo;ve got the right
      sort of governor now. You can&rsquo;t see his face for his whiskers, and can&rsquo;t
      see his whiskers for the dye upon &lsquo;em. That&rsquo;s a gentleman ain&rsquo;t it? You
      wouldn&rsquo;t like a ride in a cab, would you? Why, it wouldn&rsquo;t be safe to
      offer it. You&rsquo;d faint away, only to see me a-comin&rsquo; at a mild trot round
      the corner.&rsquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      To convey a slight idea of the effect of this approach, Mr Bailey
      counterfeited in his own person the action of a high-trotting horse and
      threw up his head so high, in backing against a pump, that he shook his
      hat off.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Why, he&rsquo;s own uncle to Capricorn,&rsquo; said Bailey, &lsquo;and brother to
      Cauliflower. He&rsquo;s been through the winders of two chaney shops since we&rsquo;ve
      had him, and was sold for killin&rsquo; his missis. That&rsquo;s a horse, I hope?&rsquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Ah! you&rsquo;ll never want to buy any more red polls, now,&rsquo; observed Poll,
      looking on his young friend with an air of melancholy. &lsquo;You&rsquo;ll never want
      to buy any more red polls now, to hang up over the sink, will you?&rsquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;I should think not,&rsquo; replied Bailey. &lsquo;Reether so. I wouldn&rsquo;t have nothin&rsquo;
      to say to any bird below a Peacock; and <i>he</i>&rsquo;d be wulgar. Well, how are
      you?&rsquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Oh! I&rsquo;m pretty well,&rsquo; said Poll. He answered the question again because
      Mr Bailey asked it again; Mr Bailey asked it again, because&mdash;accompanied
      with a straddling action of the white cords, a bend of the knees, and a
      striking forth of the top-boots&mdash;it was an easy horse-fleshy, turfy
      sort of thing to do.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Wot are you up to, old feller?&rsquo; added Mr Bailey, with the same graceful
      rakishness. He was quite the man-about-town of the conversation, while the
      easy-shaver was the child.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Why, I am going to fetch my lodger home,&rsquo; said Paul.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;A woman!&rsquo; cried Mr Bailey, &lsquo;for a twenty-pun&rsquo; note!&rsquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      The little barber hastened to explain that she was neither a young woman,
      nor a handsome woman, but a nurse, who had been acting as a kind of
      house-keeper to a gentleman for some weeks past, and left her place that
      night, in consequence of being superseded by another and a more legitimate
      house-keeper&mdash;to wit, the gentleman&rsquo;s bride.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;He&rsquo;s newly married, and he brings his young wife home to-night,&rsquo; said the
      barber. &lsquo;So I&rsquo;m going to fetch my lodger away&mdash;Mr Chuzzlewit&rsquo;s, close
      behind the Post Office&mdash;and carry her box for her.&rsquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Jonas Chuzzlewit&rsquo;s?&rsquo; said Bailey.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Ah!&rsquo; returned Paul: &lsquo;that&rsquo;s the name sure enough. Do you know him?&rsquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Oh, no!&rsquo; cried Mr Bailey; &lsquo;not at all. And I don&rsquo;t know her! Not neither!
      Why, they first kept company through me, a&rsquo;most.&rsquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Ah?&rsquo; said Paul.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Ah!&rsquo; said Mr Bailey, with a wink; &lsquo;and she ain&rsquo;t bad looking mind you.
      But her sister was the best. <i>She </i>was the merry one. I often used to have a
      bit of fun with her, in the hold times!&rsquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      Mr Bailey spoke as if he already had a leg and three-quarters in the
      grave, and this had happened twenty or thirty years ago. Paul Sweedlepipe,
      the meek, was so perfectly confounded by his precocious self-possession,
      and his patronizing manner, as well as by his boots, cockade, and livery,
      that a mist swam before his eyes, and he saw&mdash;not the Bailey of
      acknowledged juvenility from Todgers&rsquo;s Commercial Boarding House, who had
      made his acquaintance within a twelvemonth, by purchasing, at sundry
      times, small birds at twopence each&mdash;but a highly-condensed
      embodiment of all the sporting grooms in London; an abstract of all the
      stable-knowledge of the time; a something at a high-pressure that must
      have had existence many years, and was fraught with terrible experiences.
      And truly, though in the cloudy atmosphere of Todgers&rsquo;s, Mr Bailey&rsquo;s
      genius had ever shone out brightly in this particular respect, it now
      eclipsed both time and space, cheated beholders of their senses, and
      worked on their belief in defiance of all natural laws. He walked along
      the tangible and real stones of Holborn Hill, an undersized boy; and yet
      he winked the winks, and thought the thoughts, and did the deeds, and said
      the sayings of an ancient man. There was an old principle within him, and
      a young surface without. He became an inexplicable creature; a breeched
      and booted Sphinx. There was no course open to the barber, but to go
      distracted himself, or to take Bailey for granted; and he wisely chose the
      latter.
    </p>
    <p>
      Mr Bailey was good enough to continue to bear him company, and to
      entertain him, as they went, with easy conversation on various sporting
      topics; especially on the comparative merits, as a general principle, of
      horses with white stockings, and horses without. In regard to the style of
      tail to be preferred, Mr Bailey had opinions of his own, which he
      explained, but begged they might by no means influence his friend&rsquo;s, as
      here he knew he had the misfortune to differ from some excellent
      authorities. He treated Mr Sweedlepipe to a dram, compounded agreeably to
      his own directions, which he informed him had been invented by a member of
      the Jockey Club; and, as they were by this time near the barber&rsquo;s
      destination, he observed that, as he had an hour to spare, and knew the
      parties, he would, if quite agreeable, be introduced to Mrs Gamp.
    </p>
    <p>
      Paul knocked at Jonas Chuzzlewit&rsquo;s; and, on the door being opened by that
      lady, made the two distinguished persons known to one another. It was a
      happy feature in Mrs Gamp&rsquo;s twofold profession, that it gave her an
      interest in everything that was young as well as in everything that was
      old. She received Mr Bailey with much kindness.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;It&rsquo;s very good, I&rsquo;m sure, of you to come,&rsquo; she said to her landlord, &lsquo;as
      well as bring so nice a friend. But I&rsquo;m afraid that I must trouble you so
      far as to step in, for the young couple has not yet made appearance.&rsquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;They&rsquo;re late, ain&rsquo;t they?&rsquo; inquired her landlord, when she had conducted
      them downstairs into the kitchen.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Well, sir, considern&rsquo; the Wings of Love, they are,&rsquo; said Mrs Gamp.
    </p>
    <p>
      Mr Bailey inquired whether the Wings of Love had ever won a plate, or
      could be backed to do anything remarkable; and being informed that it was
      not a horse, but merely a poetical or figurative expression, evinced
      considerable disgust. Mrs Gamp was so very much astonished by his affable
      manners and great ease, that she was about to propound to her landlord in
      a whisper the staggering inquiry, whether he was a man or a boy, when Mr
      Sweedlepipe, anticipating her design, made a timely diversion.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;He knows Mrs Chuzzlewit,&rsquo; said Paul aloud.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;There&rsquo;s nothin&rsquo; he don&rsquo;t know; that&rsquo;s my opinion,&rsquo; observed Mrs Gamp.
      &lsquo;All the wickedness of the world is Print to him.&rsquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      Mr Bailey received this as a compliment, and said, adjusting his cravat,
      &lsquo;reether so.&rsquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;As you knows Mrs Chuzzlewit, you knows, p&rsquo;raps, what her chris&rsquo;en name
      is?&rsquo; Mrs Gamp observed.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Charity,&rsquo; said Bailey.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;That it ain&rsquo;t!&rsquo; cried Mrs Gamp.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Cherry, then,&rsquo; said Bailey. &lsquo;Cherry&rsquo;s short for it. It&rsquo;s all the same.&rsquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;It don&rsquo;t begin with a C at all,&rsquo; retorted Mrs Gamp, shaking her head. &lsquo;It
      begins with a M.&rsquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Whew!&rsquo; cried Mr Bailey, slapping a little cloud of pipe-clay out of his
      left leg, &lsquo;then he&rsquo;s been and married the merry one!&rsquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      As these words were mysterious, Mrs Gamp called upon him to explain, which
      Mr Bailey proceeded to do; that lady listening greedily to everything he
      said. He was yet in the fullness of his narrative when the sound of
      wheels, and a double knock at the street door, announced the arrival of
      the newly married couple. Begging him to reserve what more he had to say
      for her hearing on the way home, Mrs Gamp took up the candle, and hurried
      away to receive and welcome the young mistress of the house.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Wishing you appiness and joy with all my art,&rsquo; said Mrs Gamp, dropping a
      curtsey as they entered the hall; &lsquo;and you, too, sir. Your lady looks a
      little tired with the journey, Mr Chuzzlewit, a pretty dear!&rsquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;She has bothered enough about it,&rsquo; grumbled Mr Jonas. &lsquo;Now, show a light,
      will you?&rsquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;This way, ma&rsquo;am, if you please,&rsquo; said Mrs Gamp, going upstairs before
      them. &lsquo;Things has been made as comfortable as they could be, but there&rsquo;s
      many things you&rsquo;ll have to alter your own self when you gets time to look
      about you! Ah! sweet thing! But you don&rsquo;t,&rsquo; added Mrs Gamp, internally,
      &lsquo;you don&rsquo;t look much like a merry one, I must say!&rsquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      It was true; she did not. The death that had gone before the bridal seemed
      to have left its shade upon the house. The air was heavy and oppressive;
      the rooms were dark; a deep gloom filled up every chink and corner. Upon
      the hearthstone, like a creature of ill omen, sat the aged clerk, with his
      eyes fixed on some withered branches in the stove. He rose and looked at
      her.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;So there you are, Mr Chuff,&rsquo; said Jonas carelessly, as he dusted his
      boots; &lsquo;still in the land of the living, eh?&rsquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Still in the land of the living, sir,&rsquo; retorted Mrs Gamp. &lsquo;And Mr Chuffey
      may thank you for it, as many and many a time I&rsquo;ve told him.&rsquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      Mr Jonas was not in the best of humours, for he merely said, as he looked
      round, &lsquo;We don&rsquo;t want you any more, you know, Mrs Gamp.&rsquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;I&rsquo;m a-going immediate, sir,&rsquo; returned the nurse; &lsquo;unless there&rsquo;s nothink
      I can do for you, ma&rsquo;am. Ain&rsquo;t there,&rsquo; said Mrs Gamp, with a look of great
      sweetness, and rummaging all the time in her pocket; &lsquo;ain&rsquo;t there nothink
      I can do for you, my little bird?&rsquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;No,&rsquo; said Merry, almost crying. &lsquo;You had better go away, please!&rsquo;
      With a leer of mingled sweetness and slyness; with one eye on the future,
      one on the bride, and an arch expression in her face, partly spiritual,
      partly spirituous, and wholly professional and peculiar to her art; Mrs
      Gamp rummaged in her pocket again, and took from it a printed card,
      whereon was an inscription copied from her signboard.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Would you be so good, my darling dovey of a dear young married lady,&rsquo; Mrs
      Gamp observed, in a low voice, &lsquo;as put that somewheres where you can keep
      it in your mind? I&rsquo;m well beknown to many ladies, and it&rsquo;s my card. Gamp
      is my name, and Gamp my nater. Livin&rsquo; quite handy, I will make so bold as
      call in now and then, and make inquiry how your health and spirits is, my
      precious chick!&rsquo;
    </p>
<div class="fig" style="width:65%">
      <img src="images/20449m.jpg" alt="20449m " width="100%" /><br />
    </div>
    <h5>
      <a href="images/20449.jpg"><i>Original</i></a>
    </h5>
    <p>
      And with innumerable leers, winks, coughs, nods, smiles, and curtseys, all
      leading to the establishment of a mysterious and confidential
      understanding between herself and the bride, Mrs Gamp, invoking a blessing
      upon the house, leered, winked, coughed, nodded, smiled, and curtseyed
      herself out of the room.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;But I will say, and I would if I was led a Martha to the Stakes for it,&rsquo;
      Mrs Gamp remarked below stairs, in a whisper, &lsquo;that she don&rsquo;t look much
      like a merry one at this present moment of time.&rsquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Ah! wait till you hear her laugh!&rsquo; said Bailey.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Hem!&rsquo; cried Mrs Gamp, in a kind of groan. &lsquo;I will, child.&rsquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      They said no more in the house, for Mrs Gamp put on her bonnet, Mr
      Sweedlepipe took up her box; and Mr Bailey accompanied them towards
      Kingsgate Street; recounting to Mrs Gamp as they went along, the origin
      and progress of his acquaintance with Mrs Chuzzlewit and her sister. It
      was a pleasant instance of this youth&rsquo;s precocity, that he fancied Mrs
      Gamp had conceived a tenderness for him, and was much tickled by her
      misplaced attachment.
    </p>
    <p>
      As the door closed heavily behind them, Mrs Jonas sat down in a chair, and
      felt a strange chill creep upon her, whilst she looked about the room. It
      was pretty much as she had known it, but appeared more dreary. She had
      thought to see it brightened to receive her.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;It ain&rsquo;t good enough for you, I suppose?&rsquo; said Jonas, watching her looks.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Why, it <i>is</i> dull,&rsquo; said Merry, trying to be more herself.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;It&rsquo;ll be duller before you&rsquo;re done with it,&rsquo; retorted Jonas, &lsquo;if you give
      me any of your airs. You&rsquo;re a nice article, to turn sulky on first coming
      home! Ecod, you used to have life enough, when you could plague me with
      it. The gal&rsquo;s downstairs. Ring the bell for supper, while I take my boots
      off!&rsquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      She roused herself from looking after him as he left the room, to do what
      he had desired; when the old man Chuffey laid his hand softly on her arm.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;You are not married?&rsquo; he said eagerly. &lsquo;Not married?&rsquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Yes. A month ago. Good Heaven, what is the matter?&rsquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      He answered nothing was the matter; and turned from her. But in her fear
      and wonder, turning also, she saw him raise his trembling hands above his
      head, and heard him say:
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Oh! woe, woe, woe, upon this wicked house!&rsquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      It was her welcome&mdash;<i>home</i>.

      CHAPTER TWENTY-SEVEN
    </h2>
    <p>
      SHOWING THAT OLD FRIENDS MAY NOT ONLY APPEAR WITH NEW FACES, BUT IN FALSE
      COLOURS. THAT PEOPLE ARE PRONE TO BITE, AND THAT BITERS MAY SOMETIMES BE
      BITTEN.
    </p>
    <p>
      Mr Bailey, Junior&mdash;for the sporting character, whilom of general
      utility at Todgers&rsquo;s, had now regularly set up in life under that name,
      without troubling himself to obtain from the legislature a direct licence
      in the form of a Private Bill, which of all kinds and classes of bills is
      without exception the most unreasonable in its charges&mdash;Mr Bailey,
      Junior, just tall enough to be seen by an inquiring eye, gazing indolently
      at society from beneath the apron of his master&rsquo;s cab, drove slowly up and
      down Pall Mall, about the hour of noon, in waiting for his &lsquo;Governor.&rsquo; The
      horse of distinguished family, who had Capricorn for his nephew, and
      Cauliflower for his brother, showed himself worthy of his high relations
      by champing at the bit until his chest was white with foam, and rearing
      like a horse in heraldry; the plated harness and the patent leather
      glittered in the sun; pedestrians admired; Mr Bailey was complacent, but
      unmoved. He seemed to say, &lsquo;A barrow, good people, a mere barrow; nothing
      to what we could do, if we chose!&rsquo; and on he went, squaring his short
      green arms outside the apron, as if he were hooked on to it by his
      armpits.
    </p>
    <p>
      Mr Bailey had a great opinion of Brother to Cauliflower, and estimated his
      powers highly. But he never told him so. On the contrary, it was his
      practice, in driving that animal, to assail him with disrespectful, if not
      injurious, expressions, as, &lsquo;Ah! would you!&rsquo; &lsquo;Did you think it, then?&rsquo;
      &lsquo;Where are you going to now?&rsquo; &lsquo;No, you won&rsquo;t, my lad!&rsquo; and similar
      fragmentary remarks. These being usually accompanied by a jerk of the
      rein, or a crack of the whip, led to many trials of strength between them,
      and to many contentions for the upper-hand, terminating, now and then, in
      china-shops, and other unusual goals, as Mr Bailey had already hinted to
      his friend Poll Sweedlepipe.
    </p>
    <p>
      On the present occasion Mr Bailey, being in spirits, was more than
      commonly hard upon his charge; in consequence of which that fiery animal
      confined himself almost entirely to his hind legs in displaying his paces,
      and constantly got himself into positions with reference to the cabriolet
      that very much amazed the passengers in the street. But Mr Bailey, not at
      all disturbed, had still a shower of pleasantries to bestow on any one who
      crossed his path; as, calling to a full-grown coal-heaver in a wagon, who
      for a moment blocked the way, &lsquo;Now, young &lsquo;un, who trusted <i>you </i>with a
      cart?&rsquo; inquiring of elderly ladies who wanted to cross, and ran back
      again, &lsquo;Why they didn&rsquo;t go to the workhouse and get an order to be
      buried?&rsquo; tempting boys, with friendly words, to get up behind, and
      immediately afterwards cutting them down; and the like flashes of a
      cheerful humour, which he would occasionally relieve by going round St.
      James&rsquo;s Square at a hand gallop, and coming slowly into Pall Mall by
      another entry, as if, in the interval, his pace had been a perfect crawl.
    </p>
    <p>
      It was not until these amusements had been very often repeated, and the
      apple-stall at the corner had sustained so many miraculous escapes as to
      appear impregnable, that Mr Bailey was summoned to the door of a certain
      house in Pall Mall, and turning short, obeyed the call and jumped out. It
      was not until he had held the bridle for some minutes longer, every jerk
      of Cauliflower&rsquo;s brother&rsquo;s head, and every twitch of Cauliflower&rsquo;s
      brother&rsquo;s nostril, taking him off his legs in the meanwhile, that two
      persons entered the vehicle, one of whom took the reins and drove rapidly
      off. Nor was it until Mr Bailey had run after it some hundreds of yards in
      vain, that he managed to lift his short leg into the iron step, and
      finally to get his boots upon the little footboard behind. Then, indeed,
      he became a sight to see; and&mdash;standing now on one foot and now upon
      the other, now trying to look round the cab on this side, now on that, and
      now endeavouring to peep over the top of it, as it went dashing in among
      the carts and coaches&mdash;was from head to heel Newmarket.
    </p>
    <p>
      The appearance of Mr Bailey&rsquo;s governor as he drove along fully justified
      that enthusiastic youth&rsquo;s description of him to the wondering Poll. He had
      a world of jet-black shining hair upon his head, upon his cheeks, upon his
      chin, upon his upper lip. His clothes, symmetrically made, were of the
      newest fashion and the costliest kind. Flowers of gold and blue, and green
      and blushing red, were on his waistcoat; precious chains and jewels
      sparkled on his breast; his fingers, clogged with brilliant rings, were as
      unwieldly as summer flies but newly rescued from a honey-pot. The daylight
      mantled in his gleaming hat and boots as in a polished glass. And yet,
      though changed his name, and changed his outward surface, it was Tigg.
      Though turned and twisted upside down, and inside out, as great men have
      been sometimes known to be; though no longer Montague Tigg, but Tigg
      Montague; still it was Tigg; the same Satanic, gallant, military Tigg. The
      brass was burnished, lacquered, newly stamped; yet it was the true Tigg
      metal notwithstanding.
    </p>
    <p>
      Beside him sat a smiling gentleman, of less pretensions and of business
      looks, whom he addressed as David. Surely not the David of the&mdash;how
      shall it be phrased?&mdash;the triumvirate of golden balls? Not David,
      tapster at the Lombards&rsquo; Arms? Yes. The very man.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;The secretary&rsquo;s salary, David,&rsquo; said Mr Montague, &lsquo;the office being now
      established, is eight hundred pounds per annum, with his house-rent,
      coals, and candles free. His five-and-twenty shares he holds, of course.
      Is that enough?&rsquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      David smiled and nodded, and coughed behind a little locked portfolio
      which he carried; with an air that proclaimed him to be the secretary in
      question.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;If that&rsquo;s enough,&rsquo; said Montague, &lsquo;I will propose it at the Board to-day,
      in my capacity as chairman.&rsquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      The secretary smiled again; laughed, indeed, this time; and said, rubbing
      his nose slily with one end of the portfolio:
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;It was a capital thought, wasn&rsquo;t it?&rsquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;What was a capital thought, David?&rsquo; Mr Montague inquired.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;The Anglo-Bengalee,&rsquo; tittered the secretary.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;The Anglo-Bengalee Disinterested Loan and Life Assurance Company is
      rather a capital concern, I hope, David,&rsquo; said Montague.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Capital indeed!&rsquo; cried the secretary, with another laugh&mdash;&rsquo; in one
      sense.&rsquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;In the only important one,&rsquo; observed the chairman; &lsquo;which is number one,
      David.&rsquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;What,&rsquo; asked the secretary, bursting into another laugh, &lsquo;what will be
      the paid up capital, according to the next prospectus?&rsquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;A figure of two, and as many oughts after it as the printer can get into
      the same line,&rsquo; replied his friend. &lsquo;Ha, ha!&rsquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      At this they both laughed; the secretary so vehemently, that in kicking up
      his feet, he kicked the apron open, and nearly started Cauliflower&rsquo;s
      brother into an oyster shop; not to mention Mr Bailey&rsquo;s receiving such a
      sudden swing, that he held on for a moment quite a young Fame, by one
      strap and no legs.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;What a chap you are!&rsquo; exclaimed David admiringly, when this little alarm
      had subsided.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Say, genius, David, genius.&rsquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Well, upon my soul, you <i>are </i>a genius then,&rsquo; said David. &lsquo;I always knew
      you had the gift of the gab, of course; but I never believed you were half
      the man you are. How could I?&rsquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;I rise with circumstances, David. That&rsquo;s a point of genius in itself,&rsquo;
      said Tigg. &lsquo;If you were to lose a hundred pound wager to me at this minute
      David, and were to pay it (which is most confoundedly improbable), I
      should rise, in a mental point of view, directly.&rsquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      It is due to Mr Tigg to say that he had really risen with his
      opportunities; and, peculating on a grander scale, he had become a grander
      man altogether.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Ha, ha,&rsquo; cried the secretary, laying his hand, with growing familiarity,
      upon the chairman&rsquo;s arm. &lsquo;When I look at you, and think of your property
      in Bengal being&mdash;ha, ha, ha!&mdash;&rsquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      The half-expressed idea seemed no less ludicrous to Mr Tigg than to his
      friend, for he laughed too, heartily.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;&mdash;Being,&rsquo; resumed David, &lsquo;being amenable&mdash;your property in
      Bengal being amenable&mdash;to all claims upon the company; when I look at
      you and think of that, you might tickle me into fits by waving the feather
      of a pen at me. Upon my soul you might!&rsquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;It a devilish fine property,&rsquo; said Tigg Montague, &lsquo;to be amenable to any
      claims. The preserve of tigers alone is worth a mint of money, David.&rsquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      David could only reply in the intervals of his laughter, &lsquo;Oh, what a chap
      you are!&rsquo; and so continued to laugh, and hold his sides, and wipe his
      eyes, for some time, without offering any other observation.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;A capital idea?&rsquo; said Tigg, returning after a time to his companion&rsquo;s
      first remark; &lsquo;no doubt it was a capital idea. It was my idea.&rsquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;No, no. It was my idea,&rsquo; said David. &lsquo;Hang it, let a man have some
      credit. Didn&rsquo;t I say to you that I&rsquo;d saved a few pounds?&mdash;&rsquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;You said! Didn&rsquo;t I say to you,&rsquo; interposed Tigg, &lsquo;that I had come into a
      few pounds?&rsquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Certainly you did,&rsquo; returned David, warmly, &lsquo;but that&rsquo;s not the idea. Who
      said, that if we put the money together we could furnish an office, and
      make a show?&rsquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;And who said,&rsquo; retorted Mr Tigg, &lsquo;that, provided we did it on a
      sufficiently large scale, we could furnish an office and make a show,
      without any money at all? Be rational, and just, and calm, and tell me
      whose idea was that.&rsquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Why, there,&rsquo; David was obliged to confess, &lsquo;you had the advantage of me,
      I admit. But I don&rsquo;t put myself on a level with you. I only want a little
      credit in the business.&rsquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;All the credit you deserve to have,&rsquo; said Tigg.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;The plain work of the company, David&mdash;figures, books, circulars,
      advertisements, pen, ink, and paper, sealing-wax and wafers&mdash;is
      admirably done by you. You are a first-rate groveller. I don&rsquo;t dispute it.
      But the ornamental department, David; the inventive and poetical
      department&mdash;&rsquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Is entirely yours,&rsquo; said his friend. &lsquo;No question of it. But with such a
      swell turnout as this, and all the handsome things you&rsquo;ve got about you,
      and the life you lead, I mean to say it&rsquo;s a precious comfortable
      department too.&rsquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Does it gain the purpose? Is it Anglo-Bengalee?&rsquo; asked Tigg.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Yes,&rsquo; said David.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Could you undertake it yourself?&rsquo; demanded Tigg.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;No,&rsquo; said David.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Ha, ha!&rsquo; laughed Tigg. &lsquo;Then be contented with your station and your
      profits, David, my fine fellow, and bless the day that made us acquainted
      across the counter of our common uncle, for it was a golden day to you.&rsquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      It will have been already gathered from the conversation of these
      worthies, that they were embarked in an enterprise of some magnitude, in
      which they addressed the public in general from the strong position of
      having everything to gain and nothing at all to lose; and which, based
      upon this great principle, was thriving pretty comfortably.
    </p>
    <p>
      The Anglo-Bengalee Disinterested Loan and Life Assurance Company started
      into existence one morning, not an Infant Institution, but a Grown-up
      Company running alone at a great pace, and doing business right and left:
      with a &lsquo;branch&rsquo; in a first floor over a tailor&rsquo;s at the west-end of the
      town, and main offices in a new street in the City, comprising the upper
      part of a spacious house resplendent in stucco and plate-glass, with
      wire-blinds in all the windows, and &lsquo;Anglo-Bengalee&rsquo; worked into the
      pattern of every one of them. On the doorpost was painted again in large
      letters, &lsquo;offices of the Anglo-Bengalee Disinterested Loan and Life
      Assurance Company,&rsquo; and on the door was a large brass plate with the same
      inscription; always kept very bright, as courting inquiry; staring the
      City out of countenance after office hours on working days, and all day
      long on Sundays; and looking bolder than the Bank. Within, the offices
      were newly plastered, newly painted, newly papered, newly countered, newly
      floor-clothed, newly tabled, newly chaired, newly fitted up in every way,
      with goods that were substantial and expensive, and designed (like the
      company) to last. Business! Look at the green ledgers with red backs, like
      strong cricket-balls beaten flat; the court-guides directories, day-books,
      almanacks, letter-boxes, weighing-machines for letters, rows of
      fire-buckets for dashing out a conflagration in its first spark, and
      saving the immense wealth in notes and bonds belonging to the company;
      look at the iron safes, the clock, the office seal&mdash;in its capacious
      self, security for anything. Solidity! Look at the massive blocks of
      marble in the chimney-pieces, and the gorgeous parapet on the top of the
      house! Publicity! Why, Anglo-Bengalee Disinterested Loan and Life
      Assurance company is painted on the very coal-scuttles. It is repeated at
      every turn until the eyes are dazzled with it, and the head is giddy. It
      is engraved upon the top of all the letter paper, and it makes a
      scroll-work round the seal, and it shines out of the porter&rsquo;s buttons, and
      it is repeated twenty times in every circular and public notice wherein
      one David Crimple, Esquire, Secretary and resident Director, takes the
      liberty of inviting your attention to the accompanying statement of the
      advantages offered by the Anglo-Bengalee Disinterested Loan and Life
      Assurance Company; and fully proves to you that any connection on your
      part with that establishment must result in a perpetual Christmas Box and
      constantly increasing Bonus to yourself, and that nobody can run any risk
      by the transaction except the office, which, in its great liberality is
      pretty sure to lose. And this, David Crimple, Esquire, submits to you (and
      the odds are heavy you believe him), is the best guarantee that can
      reasonably be suggested by the Board of Management for its permanence and
      stability.
    </p>
    <p>
      This gentleman&rsquo;s name, by the way, had been originally Crimp; but as the
      word was susceptible of an awkward construction and might be
      misrepresented, he had altered it to Crimple.
    </p>
    <p>
      Lest with all these proofs and confirmations, any man should be suspicious
      of the Anglo-Bengalee Disinterested Loan and Life Assurance company;
      should doubt in tiger, cab, or person, Tigg Montague, Esquire, (of Pall
      Mall and Bengal), or any other name in the imaginative List of Directors;
      there was a porter on the premises&mdash;a wonderful creature, in a vast
      red waistcoat and a short-tailed pepper-and-salt coat&mdash;who carried
      more conviction to the minds of sceptics than the whole establishment
      without him. No confidences existed between him and the Directorship;
      nobody knew where he had served last; no character or explanation had been
      given or required. No questions had been asked on either side. This
      mysterious being, relying solely on his figure, had applied for the
      situation, and had been instantly engaged on his own terms. They were
      high; but he knew, doubtless, that no man could carry such an extent of
      waistcoat as himself, and felt the full value of his capacity to such an
      institution. When he sat upon a seat erected for him in a corner of the
      office, with his glazed hat hanging on a peg over his head, it was
      impossible to doubt the respectability of the concern. It went on doubling
      itself with every square inch of his red waistcoat until, like the problem
      of the nails in the horse&rsquo;s shoes, the total became enormous. People had
      been known to apply to effect an insurance on their lives for a thousand
      pounds, and looking at him, to beg, before the form of proposal was filled
      up, that it might be made two. And yet he was not a giant. His coat was
      rather small than otherwise. The whole charm was in his waistcoat.
      Respectability, competence, property in Bengal or anywhere else,
      responsibility to any amount on the part of the company that employed him,
      were all expressed in that one garment.
    </p>
    <p>
      Rival offices had endeavoured to lure him away; Lombard Street itself had
      beckoned to him; rich companies had whispered &lsquo;Be a Beadle!&rsquo; but he still
      continued faithful to the Anglo-Bengalee. Whether he was a deep rogue, or
      a stately simpleton, it was impossible to make out, but he appeared to
      believe in the Anglo-Bengalee. He was grave with imaginary cares of
      office; and having nothing whatever to do, and something less to take care
      of, would look as if the pressure of his numerous duties, and a sense of
      the treasure in the company&rsquo;s strong-room, made him a solemn and a
      thoughtful man.
    </p>
    <p>
      As the cabriolet drove up to the door, this officer appeared bare-headed
      on the pavement, crying aloud &lsquo;Room for the chairman, room for the
      chairman, if you please!&rsquo; much to the admiration of the bystanders, who,
      it is needless to say, had their attention directed to the Anglo-Bengalee
      Company thenceforth, by that means. Mr Tigg leaped gracefully out,
      followed by the Managing Director (who was by this time very distant and
      respectful), and ascended the stairs, still preceded by the porter, who
      cried as he went, &lsquo;By your leave there! by your leave! The Chairman of the
      Board, Gentle&mdash;<i>men</i>! In like manner, but in a still more stentorian
      voice, he ushered the chairman through the public office, where some
      humble clients were transacting business, into an awful chamber, labelled
      Board-room; the door of which sanctuary immediately closed, and screened
      the great capitalist from vulgar eyes.
    </p>
    <p>
      The board-room had a Turkey carpet in it, a sideboard, a portrait of Tigg
      Montague, Esquire, as chairman; a very imposing chair of office, garnished
      with an ivory hammer and a little hand-bell; and a long table, set out at
      intervals with sheets of blotting-paper, foolscap, clean pens, and
      inkstands. The chairman having taken his seat with great solemnity, the
      secretary supported him on his right hand, and the porter stood bolt
      upright behind them, forming a warm background of waistcoat. This was the
      board: everything else being a light-hearted little fiction.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Bullamy!&rsquo; said Mr Tigg.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Sir!&rsquo; replied the porter.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Let the Medical Officer know, with my compliments, that I wish to see
      him.&rsquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      Bullamy cleared his throat, and bustled out into the office, crying &lsquo;The
      Chairman of the Board wishes to see the Medical Officer. By your leave
      there! By your leave!&rsquo; He soon returned with the gentleman in question;
      and at both openings of the board-room door&mdash;at his coming in and at
      his going out&mdash;simple clients were seen to stretch their necks and
      stand upon their toes, thirsting to catch the slightest glimpse of that
      mysterious chamber.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Jobling, my dear friend!&rsquo; said Mr Tigg, &lsquo;how are you? Bullamy, wait
      outside. Crimple, don&rsquo;t leave us. Jobling, my good fellow, I am glad to
      see you.&rsquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;And how are you, Mr Montague, eh?&rsquo; said the Medical Officer, throwing
      himself luxuriously into an easy-chair (they were all easy-chairs in the
      board-room), and taking a handsome gold snuff-box from the pocket of his
      black satin waistcoat. &lsquo;How are you? A little worn with business, eh? If
      so, rest. A little feverish from wine, humph? If so, water. Nothing at all
      the matter, and quite comfortable? Then take some lunch. A very wholesome
      thing at this time of day to strengthen the gastric juices with lunch, Mr
      Montague.&rsquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      The Medical Officer (he was the same medical officer who had followed poor
      old Anthony Chuzzlewit to the grave, and who had attended Mrs Gamp&rsquo;s
      patient at the Bull) smiled in saying these words; and casually added, as
      he brushed some grains of snuff from his shirt-frill, &lsquo;I always take it
      myself about this time of day, do you know!&rsquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Bullamy!&rsquo; said the Chairman, ringing the little bell.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Sir!&rsquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Lunch.&rsquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Not on my account, I hope?&rsquo; said the doctor. &lsquo;You are very good. Thank
      you. I&rsquo;m quite ashamed. Ha, ha! if I had been a sharp practitioner, Mr
      Montague, I shouldn&rsquo;t have mentioned it without a fee; for you may depend
      upon it, my dear sir, that if you don&rsquo;t make a point of taking lunch,
      you&rsquo;ll very soon come under my hands. Allow me to illustrate this. In Mr
      Crimple&rsquo;s leg&mdash;&rsquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      The resident Director gave an involuntary start, for the doctor, in the
      heat of his demonstration, caught it up and laid it across his own, as if
      he were going to take it off, then and there.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;In Mr Crimple&rsquo;s leg, you&rsquo;ll observe,&rsquo; pursued the doctor, turning back
      his cuffs and spanning the limb with both hands, &lsquo;where Mr Crimple&rsquo;s knee
      fits into the socket, here, there is&mdash;that is to say, between the
      bone and the socket&mdash;a certain quantity of animal oil.&rsquo;
    </p>
<div class="fig" style="width:65%">
      <img src="images/20459m.jpg" alt="20459m " width="100%" /><br />
    </div>
    <h5>
      <a href="images/20459.jpg"><i>Original</i></a>
    </h5>
    <p>
      &lsquo;What do you pick <i>my</i> leg out for?&rsquo; said Mr Crimple, looking with something
      of an anxious expression at his limb. &lsquo;It&rsquo;s the same with other legs,
      ain&rsquo;t it?&rsquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Never you mind, my good sir,&rsquo; returned the doctor, shaking his head,
      &lsquo;whether it is the same with other legs, or not the same.&rsquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;But I do mind,&rsquo; said David.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;I take a particular case, Mr Montague,&rsquo; returned the doctor, &lsquo;as
      illustrating my remark, you observe. In this portion of Mr Crimple&rsquo;s leg,
      sir, there is a certain amount of animal oil. In every one of Mr Crimple&rsquo;s
      joints, sir, there is more or less of the same deposit. Very good. If Mr
      Crimple neglects his meals, or fails to take his proper quantity of rest,
      that oil wanes, and becomes exhausted. What is the consequence? Mr
      Crimple&rsquo;s bones sink down into their sockets, sir, and Mr Crimple becomes
      a weazen, puny, stunted, miserable man!&rsquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      The doctor let Mr Crimple&rsquo;s leg fall suddenly, as if he were already in
      that agreeable condition; turned down his wristbands again, and looked
      triumphantly at the chairman.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;We know a few secrets of nature in our profession, sir,&rsquo; said the doctor.
      &lsquo;Of course we do. We study for that; we pass the Hall and the College for
      that; and we take our station in society <i>by</i> that. It&rsquo;s extraordinary how
      little is known on these subjects generally. Where do you suppose, now&rsquo;&mdash;the
      doctor closed one eye, as he leaned back smilingly in his chair, and
      formed a triangle with his hands, of which his two thumbs composed the
      base&mdash;&lsquo;where do you suppose Mr Crimple&rsquo;s stomach is?&rsquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      Mr Crimple, more agitated than before, clapped his hand immediately below
      his waistcoat.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Not at all,&rsquo; cried the doctor; &lsquo;not at all. Quite a popular mistake! My
      good sir, you&rsquo;re altogether deceived.&rsquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;I feel it there, when it&rsquo;s out of order; that&rsquo;s all I know,&rsquo; said
      Crimple.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;You think you do,&rsquo; replied the doctor; &lsquo;but science knows better. There
      was a patient of mine once,&rsquo; touching one of the many mourning rings upon
      his fingers, and slightly bowing his head, &lsquo;a gentleman who did me the
      honour to make a very handsome mention of me in his will&mdash;&ldquo;in
      testimony,&rdquo; as he was pleased to say, &ldquo;of the unremitting zeal, talent,
      and attention of my friend and medical attendant, John Jobling, Esquire,
      M.R.C.S.,&rdquo;&mdash;who was so overcome by the idea of having all his life
      laboured under an erroneous view of the locality of this important organ,
      that when I assured him on my professional reputation, he was mistaken, he
      burst into tears, put out his hand, and said, &ldquo;Jobling, God bless you!&rdquo;
       Immediately afterwards he became speechless, and was ultimately buried at
      Brixton.&rsquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;By your leave there!&rsquo; cried Bullamy, without. &lsquo;By your leave! Refreshment
      for the Board-room!&rsquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Ha!&rsquo; said the doctor, jocularly, as he rubbed his hands, and drew his
      chair nearer to the table. &lsquo;The true Life Assurance, Mr Montague. The best
      Policy in the world, my dear sir. We should be provident, and eat and
      drink whenever we can. Eh, Mr Crimple?&rsquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      The resident Director acquiesced rather sulkily, as if the gratification
      of replenishing his stomach had been impaired by the unsettlement of his
      preconceived opinions in reference to its situation. But the appearance of
      the porter and under-porter with a tray covered with a snow-white cloth,
      which, being thrown back, displayed a pair of cold roast fowls, flanked by
      some potted meats and a cool salad, quickly restored his good humour. It
      was enhanced still further by the arrival of a bottle of excellent
      madeira, and another of champagne; and he soon attacked the repast with an
      appetite scarcely inferior to that of the medical officer.
    </p>
    <p>
      The lunch was handsomely served, with a profusion of rich glass plate, and
      china; which seemed to denote that eating and drinking on a showy scale
      formed no unimportant item in the business of the Anglo-Bengalee
      Directorship. As it proceeded, the Medical Officer grew more and more
      joyous and red-faced, insomuch that every mouthful he ate, and every drop
      of wine he swallowed, seemed to impart new lustre to his eyes, and to
      light up new sparks in his nose and forehead.
    </p>
    <p>
      In certain quarters of the City and its neighbourhood, Mr Jobling was, as
      we have already seen in some measure, a very popular character. He had a
      portentously sagacious chin, and a pompous voice, with a rich huskiness in
      some of its tones that went directly to the heart, like a ray of light
      shining through the ruddy medium of choice old burgundy. His neckerchief
      and shirt-frill were ever of the whitest, his clothes of the blackest and
      sleekest, his gold watch-chain of the heaviest, and his seals of the
      largest. His boots, which were always of the brightest, creaked as he
      walked. Perhaps he could shake his head, rub his hands, or warm himself
      before a fire, better than any man alive; and he had a peculiar way of
      smacking his lips and saying, &lsquo;Ah!&rsquo; at intervals while patients detailed
      their symptoms, which inspired great confidence. It seemed to express, &lsquo;I
      know what you&rsquo;re going to say better than you do; but go on, go on.&rsquo; As he
      talked on all occasions whether he had anything to say or not, it was
      unanimously observed of him that he was &lsquo;full of anecdote;&rsquo; and his
      experience and profit from it were considered, for the same reason, to be
      something much too extensive for description. His female patients could
      never praise him too highly; and the coldest of his male admirers would
      always say this for him to their friends, &lsquo;that whatever Jobling&rsquo;s
      professional skill might be (and it could not be denied that he had a very
      high reputation), he was one of the most comfortable fellows you ever saw
      in your life!&rsquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      Jobling was for many reasons, and not last in the list because his
      connection lay principally among tradesmen and their families, exactly the
      sort of person whom the Anglo-Bengalee Company wanted for a medical
      officer. But Jobling was far too knowing to connect himself with the
      company in any closer ties than as a paid (and well paid) functionary, or
      to allow his connection to be misunderstood abroad, if he could help it.
      Hence he always stated the case to an inquiring patient, after this
      manner:
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Why, my dear sir, with regard to the Anglo-Bengalee, my information, you
      see, is limited; very limited. I am the medical officer, in consideration
      of a certain monthly payment. The labourer is worthy of his hire; <i>bis dat
            qui cito dat</i>&rsquo;&mdash;(&lsquo;classical scholar, Jobling!&rsquo; thinks the patient,
      &lsquo;well-read man!&rsquo;)&mdash;&lsquo;and I receive it regularly. Therefore I am bound,
      so far as my own knowledge goes, to speak well of the establishment.&rsquo;
      (&lsquo;Nothing can be fairer than Jobling&rsquo;s conduct,&rsquo; thinks the patient, who
      has just paid Jobling&rsquo;s bill himself.) &lsquo;If you put any question to me, my
      dear friend,&rsquo; says the doctor, &lsquo;touching the responsibility or capital of
      the company, there I am at fault; for I have no head for figures, and not
      being a shareholder, am delicate of showing any curiosity whatever on the
      subject. Delicacy&mdash;your amiable lady will agree with me I am sure&mdash;should
      be one of the first characteristics of a medical man.&rsquo; (&lsquo;Nothing can be
      finer or more gentlemanly than Jobling&rsquo;s feeling,&rsquo; thinks the patient.)
      &lsquo;Very good, my dear sir, so the matter stands. You don&rsquo;t know Mr Montague?
      I&rsquo;m sorry for it. A remarkably handsome man, and quite the gentleman in
      every respect. Property, I am told, in India. House and everything
      belonging to him, beautiful. Costly furniture on the most elegant and
      lavish scale. And pictures, which, even in an anatomical point of view,
      are perfection. In case you should ever think of doing anything with the
      company, I&rsquo;ll pass you, you may depend upon it. I can conscientiously
      report you a healthy subject. If I understand any man&rsquo;s constitution, it
      is yours; and this little indisposition has done him more good, ma&rsquo;am,&rsquo;
      says the doctor, turning to the patient&rsquo;s wife, &lsquo;than if he had swallowed
      the contents of half the nonsensical bottles in my surgery. For they <i>are</i>
      nonsense&mdash;to tell the honest truth, one half of them are nonsense&mdash;compared
      with such a constitution as his!&rsquo; (&lsquo;Jobling is the most friendly creature
      I ever met with in my life,&rsquo; thinks the patient; &lsquo;and upon my word and
      honour, I&rsquo;ll consider of it!&rsquo;)
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Commission to you, doctor, on four new policies, and a loan this morning,
      eh?&rsquo; said Crimple, looking, when they had finished lunch, over some papers
      brought in by the porter. &lsquo;Well done!&rsquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Jobling, my dear friend,&rsquo; said Tigg, &lsquo;long life to you.&rsquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;No, no. Nonsense. Upon my word I&rsquo;ve no right to draw the commission,&rsquo;
      said the doctor, &lsquo;I haven&rsquo;t really. It&rsquo;s picking your pocket. I don&rsquo;t
      recommend anybody here. I only say what I know. My patients ask me what I
      know, and I tell &lsquo;em what I know. Nothing else. Caution is my weak side,
      that&rsquo;s the truth; and always was from a boy. That is,&rsquo; said the doctor,
      filling his glass, &lsquo;caution in behalf of other people. Whether I would
      repose confidence in this company myself, if I had not been paying money
      elsewhere for many years&mdash;that&rsquo;s quite another question.&rsquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      He tried to look as if there were no doubt about it; but feeling that he
      did it but indifferently, changed the theme and praised the wine.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Talking of wine,&rsquo; said the doctor, &lsquo;reminds me of one of the finest
      glasses of light old port I ever drank in my life; and that was at a
      funeral. You have not seen anything of&mdash;of <i>that </i>party, Mr Montague,
      have you?&rsquo; handing him a card.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;He is not buried, I hope?&rsquo; said Tigg, as he took it. &lsquo;The honour of his
      company is not requested if he is.&rsquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Ha, ha!&rsquo; laughed the doctor. &lsquo;No; not quite. He was honourably connected
      with that very occasion though.&rsquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Oh!&rsquo; said Tigg, smoothing his moustache, as he cast his eyes upon the
      name. &lsquo;I recollect. No. He has not been here.&rsquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      The words were on his lips, when Bullamy entered, and presented a card to
      the Medical Officer.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Talk of the what&rsquo;s his name&mdash;&rsquo; observed the doctor rising.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;And he&rsquo;s sure to appear, eh?&rsquo; said Tigg.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Why, no, Mr Montague, no,&rsquo; returned the doctor. &lsquo;We will not say that in
      the present case, for this gentleman is very far from it.&rsquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;So much the better,&rsquo; retorted Tigg. &lsquo;So much the more adaptable to the
      Anglo-Bengalee. Bullamy, clear the table and take the things out by the
      other door. Mr Crimple, business.&rsquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Shall I introduce him?&rsquo; asked Jobling.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;I shall be eternally delighted,&rsquo; answered Tigg, kissing his hand and
      smiling sweetly.
    </p>
    <p>
      The doctor disappeared into the outer office, and immediately returned
      with Jonas Chuzzlewit.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Mr Montague,&rsquo; said Jobling. &lsquo;Allow me. My friend Mr Chuzzlewit. My dear
      friend&mdash;our chairman. Now do you know,&rsquo; he added checking himself
      with infinite policy, and looking round with a smile; &lsquo;that&rsquo;s a very
      singular instance of the force of example. It really is a very remarkable
      instance of the force of example. I say <i>our </i>chairman. Why do I say our
      chairman? Because he is not <i>my</i> chairman, you know. I have no connection
      with the company, farther than giving them, for a certain fee and reward,
      my poor opinion as a medical man, precisely as I may give it any day to
      Jack Noakes or Tom Styles. Then why do I say our chairman? Simply because
      I hear the phrase constantly repeated about me. Such is the involuntary
      operation of the mental faculty in the imitative biped man. Mr Crimple, I
      believe you never take snuff? Injudicious. You should.&rsquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      Pending these remarks on the part of the doctor, and the lengthened and
      sonorous pinch with which he followed them up, Jonas took a seat at the
      board; as ungainly a man as ever he has been within the reader&rsquo;s
      knowledge. It is too common with all of us, but it is especially in the
      nature of a mean mind, to be overawed by fine clothes and fine furniture.
      They had a very decided influence on Jonas.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Now you two gentlemen have business to discuss, I know,&rsquo; said the doctor,
      &lsquo;and your time is precious. So is mine; for several lives are waiting for
      me in the next room, and I have a round of visits to make after&mdash;after
      I have taken &lsquo;em. Having had the happiness to introduce you to each other,
      I may go about my business. Good-bye. But allow me, Mr Montague, before I
      go, to say this of my friend who sits beside you: That gentleman has done
      more, sir,&rsquo; rapping his snuff-box solemnly, &lsquo;to reconcile me to human
      nature, than any man alive or dead. Good-bye!&rsquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      With these words Jobling bolted abruptly out of the room, and proceeded in
      his own official department, to impress the lives in waiting with a sense
      of his keen conscientiousness in the discharge of his duty, and the great
      difficulty of getting into the Anglo-Bengalee; by feeling their pulses,
      looking at their tongues, listening at their ribs, poking them in the
      chest, and so forth; though, if he didn&rsquo;t well know beforehand that
      whatever kind of lives they were, the Anglo-Bengalee would accept them
      readily, he was far from being the Jobling that his friend considered him;
      and was not the original Jobling, but a spurious imitation.
    </p>
    <p>
      Mr Crimple also departed on the business of the morning; and Jonas
      Chuzzlewit and Tigg were left alone.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;I learn from our friend,&rsquo; said Tigg, drawing his chair towards Jonas with
      a winning ease of manner, &lsquo;that you have been thinking&mdash;&rsquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Oh! Ecod then he&rsquo;d no right to say so,&rsquo; cried Jonas, interrupting. &lsquo;I
      didn&rsquo;t tell <i>him </i>my thoughts. If he took it into his head that I was coming
      here for such or such a purpose, why, that&rsquo;s his lookout. I don&rsquo;t stand
      committed by that.&rsquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      Jonas said this offensively enough; for over and above the habitual
      distrust of his character, it was in his nature to seek to revenge himself
      on the fine clothes and the fine furniture, in exact proportion as he had
      been unable to withstand their influence.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;If I come here to ask a question or two, and get a document or two to
      consider of, I don&rsquo;t bind myself to anything. Let&rsquo;s understand that, you
      know,&rsquo; said Jonas.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;My dear fellow!&rsquo; cried Tigg, clapping him on the shoulder, &lsquo;I applaud
      your frankness. If men like you and I speak openly at first, all possible
      misunderstanding is avoided. Why should I disguise what you know so well,
      but what the crowd never dream of? We companies are all birds of prey;
      mere birds of prey. The only question is, whether in serving our own turn,
      we can serve yours too; whether in double-lining our own nest, we can put
      a single living into yours. Oh, you&rsquo;re in our secret. You&rsquo;re behind the
      scenes. We&rsquo;ll make a merit of dealing plainly with you, when we know we
      can&rsquo;t help it.&rsquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      It was remarked, on the first introduction of Mr Jonas into these pages,
      that there is a simplicity of cunning no less than a simplicity of
      innocence, and that in all matters involving a faith in knavery, he was
      the most credulous of men. If Mr Tigg had preferred any claim to high and
      honourable dealing, Jonas would have suspected him though he had been a
      very model of probity; but when he gave utterance to Jonas&rsquo;s own thoughts
      of everything and everybody, Jonas began to feel that he was a pleasant
      fellow, and one to be talked to freely.
    </p>
    <p>
      He changed his position in the chair, not for a less awkward, but for a
      more boastful attitude; and smiling in his miserable conceit rejoined:
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;You an&rsquo;t a bad man of business, Mr Montague. You know how to set about
      it, I <i>will </i>say.&rsquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Tut, tut,&rsquo; said Tigg, nodding confidentially, and showing his white
      teeth; &lsquo;we are not children, Mr Chuzzlewit; we are grown men, I hope.&rsquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      Jonas assented, and said after a short silence, first spreading out his
      legs, and sticking one arm akimbo to show how perfectly at home he was,
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;The truth is&mdash;&rsquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Don&rsquo;t say, the truth,&rsquo; interposed Tigg, with another grin. &lsquo;It&rsquo;s so like
      humbug.&rsquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      Greatly charmed by this, Jonas began again.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;The long and the short of it is&mdash;&rsquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Better,&rsquo; muttered Tigg. &lsquo;Much better!&rsquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;&mdash;That I didn&rsquo;t consider myself very well used by one or two of the
      old companies in some negotiations I have had with &lsquo;em&mdash;once had, I
      mean. They started objections they had no right to start, and put
      questions they had no right to put, and carried things much too high for
      my taste.&rsquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      As he made these observations he cast down his eyes, and looked curiously
      at the carpet. Mr Tigg looked curiously at him.
    </p>
    <p>
      He made so long a pause, that Tigg came to the rescue, and said, in his
      pleasantest manner:
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Take a glass of wine.&rsquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;No, no,&rsquo; returned Jonas, with a cunning shake of the head; &lsquo;none of that,
      thankee. No wine over business. All very well for you, but it wouldn&rsquo;t do
      for me.&rsquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;What an old hand you are, Mr Chuzzlewit!&rsquo; said Tigg, leaning back in his
      chair, and leering at him through his half-shut eyes.
    </p>
    <p>
      Jonas shook his head again, as much as to say, &lsquo;You&rsquo;re right there;&rsquo; And
      then resumed, jocosely:
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Not such an old hand, either, but that I&rsquo;ve been and got married. That&rsquo;s
      rather green, you&rsquo;ll say. Perhaps it is, especially as she&rsquo;s young. But
      one never knows what may happen to these women, so I&rsquo;m thinking of
      insuring her life. It is but fair, you know, that a man should secure some
      consolation in case of meeting with such a loss.&rsquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;If anything can console him under such heart-breaking circumstances,&rsquo;
      murmured Tigg, with his eyes shut up as before.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Exactly,&rsquo; returned Jonas; &lsquo;if anything can. Now, supposing I did it here,
      I should do it cheap, I know, and easy, without bothering her about it;
      which I&rsquo;d much rather not do, for it&rsquo;s just in a woman&rsquo;s way to take it
      into her head, if you talk to her about such things, that she&rsquo;s going to
      die directly.&rsquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;So it is,&rsquo; cried Tigg, kissing his hand in honour of the sex. &lsquo;You&rsquo;re
      quite right. Sweet, silly, fluttering little simpletons!&rsquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Well,&rsquo; said Jonas, &lsquo;on that account, you know, and because offence has
      been given me in other quarters, I wouldn&rsquo;t mind patronizing this Company.
      But I want to know what sort of security there is for the Company&rsquo;s going
      on. That&rsquo;s the&mdash;&rsquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Not the truth?&rsquo; cried Tigg, holding up his jewelled hand. &lsquo;Don&rsquo;t use that
      Sunday School expression, please!&rsquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;The long and the short of it,&rsquo; said Jonas. &lsquo;The long and the short of it
      is, what&rsquo;s the security?&rsquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;The paid-up capital, my dear sir,&rsquo; said Tigg, referring to some papers on
      the table, &lsquo;is, at this present moment&mdash;&rsquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Oh! I understand all about paid-up capitals, you know,&rsquo; said Jonas.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;You do?&rsquo; cried Tigg, stopping short.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;I should hope so.&rsquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      He turned the papers down again, and moving nearer to him, said in his
      ear:
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;I know you do. I know you do. Look at me!&rsquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      It was not much in Jonas&rsquo;s way to look straight at anybody; but thus
      requested, he made shift to take a tolerable survey of the chairman&rsquo;s
      features. The chairman fell back a little, to give him the better
      opportunity.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;You know me?&rsquo; he inquired, elevating his eyebrows. &lsquo;You recollect? You&rsquo;ve
      seen me before?&rsquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Why, I thought I remembered your face when I first came in,&rsquo; said Jonas,
      gazing at it; &lsquo;but I couldn&rsquo;t call to mind where I had seen it. No. I
      don&rsquo;t remember, even now. Was it in the street?&rsquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Was it in Pecksniff&rsquo;s parlour?&rsquo; said Tigg
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;In Pecksniff&rsquo;s parlour!&rsquo; echoed Jonas, fetching a long breath. &lsquo;You don&rsquo;t
      mean when&mdash;&rsquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Yes,&rsquo; cried Tigg, &lsquo;when there was a very charming and delightful little
      family party, at which yourself and your respected father assisted.&rsquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Well, never mind <i>him</i>,&rsquo; said Jonas. &lsquo;He&rsquo;s dead, and there&rsquo;s no help for
      it.&rsquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Dead, is he!&rsquo; cried Tigg, &lsquo;Venerable old gentleman, is he dead! You&rsquo;re
      very like him.&rsquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      Jonas received this compliment with anything but a good grace, perhaps
      because of his own private sentiments in reference to the personal
      appearance of his deceased parent; perhaps because he was not best pleased
      to find that Montague and Tigg were one. That gentleman perceived it, and
      tapping him familiarly on the sleeve, beckoned him to the window. From
      this moment, Mr Montague&rsquo;s jocularity and flow of spirits were remarkable.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Do you find me at all changed since that time?&rsquo; he asked. &lsquo;Speak
      plainly.&rsquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      Jonas looked hard at his waistcoat and jewels; and said &lsquo;Rather, ecod!&rsquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Was I at all seedy in those days?&rsquo; asked Montague.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Precious seedy,&rsquo; said Jonas.
    </p>
    <p>
      Mr Montague pointed down into the street, where Bailey and the cab were in
      attendance.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Neat; perhaps dashing. Do you know whose it is?&rsquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;No.&rsquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Mine. Do you like this room?&rsquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;It must have cost a lot of money,&rsquo; said Jonas.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;You&rsquo;re right. Mine too. Why don&rsquo;t you&rsquo;&mdash;he whispered this, and
      nudged him in the side with his elbow&mdash;&lsquo;why don&rsquo;t you take premiums,
      instead of paying &lsquo;em? That&rsquo;s what a man like you should do. Join us!&rsquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      Jonas stared at him in amazement.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Is that a crowded street?&rsquo; asked Montague, calling his attention to the
      multitude without.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Very,&rsquo; said Jonas, only glancing at it, and immediately afterwards
      looking at him again.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;There are printed calculations,&rsquo; said his companion, &lsquo;which will tell you
      pretty nearly how many people will pass up and down that thoroughfare in
      the course of a day. I can tell you how many of &lsquo;em will come in here,
      merely because they find this office here; knowing no more about it than
      they do of the Pyramids. Ha, ha! Join us. You shall come in cheap.&rsquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      Jonas looked at him harder and harder.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;I can tell you,&rsquo; said Tigg in his ear, &lsquo;how many of &lsquo;em will buy
      annuities, effect insurances, bring us their money in a hundred shapes and
      ways, force it upon us, trust us as if we were the Mint; yet know no more
      about us than you do of that crossing-sweeper at the corner. Not so much.
      Ha, ha!&rsquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      Jonas gradually broke into a smile.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Yah!&rsquo; said Montague, giving him a pleasant thrust in the breast; &lsquo;you&rsquo;re
      too deep for us, you dog, or I wouldn&rsquo;t have told you. Dine with me
      to-morrow, in Pall Mall!&rsquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;I will&rsquo; said Jonas.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Done!&rsquo; cried Montague. &lsquo;Wait a bit. Take these papers with you and look
      &lsquo;em over. See,&rsquo; he said, snatching some printed forms from the table. &lsquo;B
      is a little tradesman, clerk, parson, artist, author, any common thing you
      like.&rsquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Yes,&rsquo; said Jonas, looking greedily over his shoulder. &lsquo;Well!&rsquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;B wants a loan. Say fifty or a hundred pound; perhaps more; no matter. B
      proposes self and two securities. B is accepted. Two securities give a
      bond. B assures his own life for double the amount, and brings two
      friends&rsquo; lives also&mdash;just to patronize the office. Ha ha, ha! Is that
      a good notion?&rsquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Ecod, that&rsquo;s a capital notion!&rsquo; cried Jonas. &lsquo;But does he really do it?&rsquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Do it!&rsquo; repeated the chairman. &lsquo;B&rsquo;s hard up, my good fellow, and will do
      anything. Don&rsquo;t you see? It&rsquo;s my idea.&rsquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;It does you honour. I&rsquo;m blest if it don&rsquo;t,&rsquo; said Jonas.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;I think it does,&rsquo; replied the chairman, &lsquo;and I&rsquo;m proud to hear you say
      so. B pays the highest lawful interest&mdash;&rsquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;That an&rsquo;t much,&rsquo; interrupted Jonas.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Right! quite right!&rsquo; retorted Tigg. &lsquo;And hard it is upon the part of the
      law that it should be so confoundedly down upon us unfortunate victims;
      when it takes such amazing good interest for itself from all its clients.
      But charity begins at home, and justice begins next door. Well! The law
      being hard upon us, we&rsquo;re not exactly soft upon B; for besides charging B
      the regular interest, we get B&rsquo;s premium, and B&rsquo;s friends&rsquo; premiums, and
      we charge B for the bond, and, whether we accept him or not, we charge B
      for &ldquo;inquiries&rdquo; (we keep a man, at a pound a week, to make &lsquo;em), and we
      charge B a trifle for the secretary; and in short, my good fellow, we
      stick it into B, up hill and down dale, and make a devilish comfortable
      little property out of him. Ha, ha, ha! I drive B, in point of fact,&rsquo; said
      Tigg, pointing to the cabriolet, &lsquo;and a thoroughbred horse he is. Ha, ha,
      ha!&rsquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      Jonas enjoyed this joke very much indeed. It was quite in his peculiar
      vein of humour.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Then,&rsquo; said Tigg Montague, &lsquo;we grant annuities on the very lowest and
      most advantageous terms known in the money market; and the old ladies and
      gentlemen down in the country buy &lsquo;em. Ha, ha, ha! And we pay &lsquo;em too&mdash;perhaps.
      Ha, ha, ha!&rsquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;But there&rsquo;s responsibility in that,&rsquo; said Jonas, looking doubtful.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;I take it all myself,&rsquo; said Tigg Montague. &lsquo;Here I am responsible for
      everything. The only responsible person in the establishment! Ha, ha, ha!
      Then there are the Life Assurances without loans; the common policies.
      Very profitable, very comfortable. Money down, you know; repeated every
      year; capital fun!&rsquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;But when they begin to fall in,&rsquo; observed Jonas. &lsquo;It&rsquo;s all very well,
      while the office is young, but when the policies begin to die&mdash;that&rsquo;s
      what I am thinking of.&rsquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;At the first start, my dear fellow,&rsquo; said Montague, &lsquo;to show you how
      correct your judgment is, we had a couple of unlucky deaths that brought
      us down to a grand piano.&rsquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Brought you down where?&rsquo; cried Jonas.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;I give you my sacred word of honour,&rsquo; said Tigg Montague, &lsquo;that I raised
      money on every other individual piece of property, and was left alone in
      the world with a grand piano. And it was an upright-grand too, so that I
      couldn&rsquo;t even sit upon it. But, my dear fellow, we got over it. We granted
      a great many new policies that week (liberal allowance to solicitors, by
      the bye), and got over it in no time. Whenever they should chance to fall
      in heavily, as you very justly observe they may, one of these days; then&mdash;&rsquo;
      he finished the sentence in so low a whisper, that only one disconnected
      word was audible, and that imperfectly. But it sounded like &lsquo;Bolt.&rsquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Why, you&rsquo;re as bold as brass!&rsquo; said Jonas, in the utmost admiration.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;A man can well afford to be as bold as brass, my good fellow, when he
      gets gold in exchange!&rsquo; cried the chairman, with a laugh that shook him
      from head to foot. &lsquo;You&rsquo;ll dine with me to-morrow?&rsquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;At what time?&rsquo; asked Jonas.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Seven. Here&rsquo;s my card. Take the documents. I see you&rsquo;ll join us!&rsquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;I don&rsquo;t know about that,&rsquo; said Jonas. &lsquo;There&rsquo;s a good deal to be looked
      into first.&rsquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;You shall look,&rsquo; said Montague, slapping him on the back, &lsquo;into anything
      and everything you please. But you&rsquo;ll join us, I am convinced. You were
      made for it. Bullamy!&rsquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      Obedient to the summons and the little bell, the waistcoat appeared. Being
      charged to show Jonas out, it went before; and the voice within it cried,
      as usual, &lsquo;By your leave there, by your leave! Gentleman from the
      board-room, by your leave!&rsquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      Mr Montague being left alone, pondered for some moments, and then said,
      raising his voice:
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Is Nadgett in the office there?&rsquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Here he is, sir.&rsquo; And he promptly entered; shutting the board-room door
      after him, as carefully as if he were about to plot a murder.
    </p>
    <p>
      He was the man at a pound a week who made the inquiries. It was no virtue
      or merit in Nadgett that he transacted all his Anglo-Bengalee business
      secretly and in the closest confidence; for he was born to be a secret. He
      was a short, dried-up, withered old man, who seemed to have secreted his
      very blood; for nobody would have given him credit for the possession of
      six ounces of it in his whole body. How he lived was a secret; where he
      lived was a secret; and even what he was, was a secret. In his musty old
      pocket-book he carried contradictory cards, in some of which he called
      himself a coal-merchant, in others a wine-merchant, in others a
      commission-agent, in others a collector, in others an accountant; as if he
      really didn&rsquo;t know the secret himself. He was always keeping appointments
      in the City, and the other man never seemed to come. He would sit on
      &lsquo;Change for hours, looking at everybody who walked in and out, and would
      do the like at Garraway&rsquo;s, and in other business coffee-rooms, in some of
      which he would be occasionally seen drying a very damp pocket-handkerchief
      before the fire, and still looking over his shoulder for the man who never
      appeared. He was mildewed, threadbare, shabby; always had flue upon his
      legs and back; and kept his linen so secretly buttoning up and wrapping
      over, that he might have had none&mdash;perhaps he hadn&rsquo;t. He carried one
      stained beaver glove, which he dangled before him by the forefinger as he
      walked or sat; but even its fellow was a secret. Some people said he had
      been a bankrupt, others that he had gone an infant into an ancient
      Chancery suit which was still depending, but it was all a secret. He
      carried bits of sealing-wax and a hieroglyphical old copper seal in his
      pocket, and often secretly indited letters in corner boxes of the
      trysting-places before mentioned; but they never appeared to go to
      anybody, for he would put them into a secret place in his coat, and
      deliver them to himself weeks afterwards, very much to his own surprise,
      quite yellow. He was that sort of man that if he had died worth a million
      of money, or had died worth twopence halfpenny, everybody would have been
      perfectly satisfied, and would have said it was just as they expected. And
      yet he belonged to a class; a race peculiar to the City; who are secrets
      as profound to one another, as they are to the rest of mankind.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Mr Nadgett,&rsquo; said Montague, copying Jonas Chuzzlewit&rsquo;s address upon a
      piece of paper, from the card which was still lying on the table, &lsquo;any
      information about this name, I shall be glad to have myself. Don&rsquo;t you
      mind what it is. Any you can scrape together, bring me. Bring it to me, Mr
      Nadgett.&rsquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      Nadgett put on his spectacles, and read the name attentively; then looked
      at the chairman over his glasses, and bowed; then took them off, and put
      them in their case; and then put the case in his pocket. When he had done
      so, he looked, without his spectacles, at the paper as it lay before him,
      and at the same time produced his pocket-book from somewhere about the
      middle of his spine. Large as it was, it was very full of documents, but
      he found a place for this one; and having clasped it carefully, passed it
      by a kind of solemn legerdemain into the same region as before.
    </p>
    <p>
      He withdrew with another bow and without a word; opening the door no wider
      than was sufficient for his passage out; and shutting it as carefully as
      before. The chairman of the board employed the rest of the morning in
      affixing his sign-manual of gracious acceptance to various new proposals
      of annuity-purchase and assurance. The Company was looking up, for they
      flowed in gayly.

    <h2>
      CHAPTER TWENTY-EIGHT
    </h2>
    <h3>
      MR. MONTAGUE AT HOME. AND MR. JONAS CHUZZLEWIT AT HOME
    </h3>
    <p>
      There were many powerful reasons for Jonas Chuzzlewit being strongly
      prepossessed in favour of the scheme which its great originator had so
      boldly laid open to him; but three among them stood prominently forward.
      Firstly, there was money to be made by it. Secondly, the money had the
      peculiar charm of being sagaciously obtained at other people&rsquo;s cost.
      Thirdly, it involved much outward show of homage and distinction: a board
      being an awful institution in its own sphere, and a director a mighty man.
      &lsquo;To make a swingeing profit, have a lot of chaps to order about, and get
      into regular good society by one and the same means, and them so easy to
      one&rsquo;s hand, ain&rsquo;t such a bad look-out,&rsquo; thought Jonas. The latter
      considerations were only second to his avarice; for, conscious that there
      was nothing in his person, conduct, character, or accomplishments, to
      command respect, he was greedy of power, and was, in his heart, as much a
      tyrant as any laureled conqueror on record.
    </p>
    <p>
      But he determined to proceed with cunning and caution, and to be very keen
      on his observation of the gentility of Mr Montague&rsquo;s private
      establishment. For it no more occurred to this shallow knave that Montague
      wanted him to be so, or he wouldn&rsquo;t have invited him while his decision
      was yet in abeyance, than the possibility of that genius being able to
      overreach him in any way, pierced through his self-deceit by the inlet of
      a needle&rsquo;s point. He had said, in the outset, that Jonas was too sharp for
      him; and Jonas, who would have been sharp enough to believe him in nothing
      else, though he had solemnly sworn it, believed him in that, instantly.
    </p>
    <p>
      It was with a faltering hand, and yet with an imbecile attempt at a
      swagger, that he knocked at his new friend&rsquo;s door in Pall Mall when the
      appointed hour arrived. Mr Bailey quickly answered to the summons. He was
      not proud and was kindly disposed to take notice of Jonas; but Jonas had
      forgotten him.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Mr Montague at home?&rsquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;I should hope he wos at home, and waiting dinner, too,&rsquo; said Bailey, with
      the ease of an old acquaintance. &lsquo;Will you take your hat up along with
      you, or leave it here?&rsquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      Mr Jonas preferred leaving it there.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;The hold name, I suppose?&rsquo; said Bailey, with a grin.
    </p>
    <p>
      Mr Jonas stared at him in mute indignation.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;What, don&rsquo;t you remember hold mother Todgers&rsquo;s?&rsquo; said Mr Bailey, with his
      favourite action of the knees and boots. &lsquo;Don&rsquo;t you remember my taking
      your name up to the young ladies, when you came a-courting there? A
      reg&rsquo;lar scaly old shop, warn&rsquo;t it? Times is changed ain&rsquo;t they. I say how
      you&rsquo;ve growed!&rsquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      Without pausing for any acknowledgement of this compliment, he ushered the
      visitor upstairs, and having announced him, retired with a private wink.
    </p>
    <p>
      The lower story of the house was occupied by a wealthy tradesman, but Mr
      Montague had all the upper portion, and splendid lodging it was. The room
      in which he received Jonas was a spacious and elegant apartment, furnished
      with extreme magnificence; decorated with pictures, copies from the
      antique in alabaster and marble, china vases, lofty mirrors, crimson
      hangings of the richest silk, gilded carvings, luxurious couches,
      glistening cabinets inlaid with precious woods; costly toys of every sort
      in negligent abundance. The only guests besides Jonas were the doctor, the
      resident Director, and two other gentlemen, whom Montague presented in due
      form.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;My dear friend, I am delighted to see you. Jobling you know, I believe?&rsquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;I think so,&rsquo; said the doctor pleasantly, as he stepped out of the circle
      to shake hands. &lsquo;I trust I have the honour. I hope so. My dear sir, I see
      you well. Quite well? <i>That&rsquo;s</i> well!&rsquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Mr Wolf,&rsquo; said Montague, as soon as the doctor would allow him to
      introduce the two others, &lsquo;Mr Chuzzlewit. Mr Pip, Mr Chuzzlewit.&rsquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      Both gentlemen were exceedingly happy to have the honour of making Mr
      Chuzzlewit&rsquo;s acquaintance. The doctor drew Jonas a little apart, and
      whispered behind his hand:
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Men of the world, my dear sir&mdash;men of the world. Hem! Mr Wolf&mdash;literary
      character&mdash;you needn&rsquo;t mention it&mdash;remarkably clever weekly
      paper&mdash;oh, remarkably clever! Mr Pip&mdash;theatrical man&mdash;capital
      man to know&mdash;oh, capital man!&rsquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Well!&rsquo; said Wolf, folding his arms and resuming a conversation which the
      arrival of Jonas had interrupted. &lsquo;And what did Lord Nobley say to that?&rsquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Why,&rsquo; returned Pip, with an oath. &lsquo;He didn&rsquo;t know what to say. Same, sir,
      if he wasn&rsquo;t as mute as a poker. But you know what a good fellow Nobley
      is!&rsquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;The best fellow in the world!&rsquo; cried Wolf. &lsquo;It as only last week that
      Nobley said to me, &ldquo;By Gad, Wolf, I&rsquo;ve got a living to bestow, and if you
      had but been brought up at the University, strike me blind if I wouldn&rsquo;t
      have made a parson of you!&rdquo;&rsquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Just like him,&rsquo; said Pip with another oath. &lsquo;And he&rsquo;d have done it!&rsquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Not a doubt of it,&rsquo; said Wolf. &lsquo;But you were going to tell us&mdash;&rsquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Oh, yes!&rsquo; cried Pip. &lsquo;To be sure. So I was. At first he was dumb&mdash;sewn
      up, dead, sir&mdash;but after a minute he said to the Duke, &ldquo;Here&rsquo;s Pip.
      Ask Pip. Pip&rsquo;s our mutual friend. Ask Pip. He knows.&rdquo; &ldquo;Damme!&rdquo; said the
      Duke, &ldquo;I appeal to Pip then. Come, Pip. Bandy or not bandy? Speak out!&rdquo;
       &ldquo;Bandy, your Grace, by the Lord Harry!&rdquo; said I. &ldquo;Ha, ha!&rdquo; laughed the
      Duke. &ldquo;To be sure she is. Bravo, Pip. Well said Pip. I wish I may die if
      you&rsquo;re not a trump, Pip. Pop me down among your fashionable visitors
      whenever I&rsquo;m in town, Pip.&rdquo; And so I do, to this day.&rsquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      The conclusion of this story gave immense satisfaction, which was in no
      degree lessened by the announcement of dinner. Jonas repaired to the
      dining room, along with his distinguished host, and took his seat at the
      board between that individual and his friend the doctor. The rest fell
      into their places like men who were well accustomed to the house; and
      dinner was done full justice to, by all parties.
    </p>
    <p>
      It was a good a one as money (or credit, no matter which) could produce.
      The dishes, wines, and fruits were of the choicest kind. Everything was
      elegantly served. The plate was gorgeous. Mr Jonas was in the midst of a
      calculation of the value of this item alone, when his host disturbed him.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;A glass of wine?&rsquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Oh!&rsquo; said Jonas, who had had several glasses already. &lsquo;As much of that as
      you like! It&rsquo;s too good to refuse.&rsquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Well said, Mr Chuzzlewit!&rsquo; cried Wolf.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Tom Gag, upon my soul!&rsquo; said Pip.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Positively, you know, that&rsquo;s&mdash;ha, ha, ha!&rsquo; observed the doctor,
      laying down his knife and fork for one instant, and then going to work
      again, pell-mell&mdash;&lsquo;that&rsquo;s epigrammatic; quite!&rsquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;You&rsquo;re tolerably comfortable, I hope?&rsquo; said Tigg, apart to Jonas.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Oh! You needn&rsquo;t trouble your head about <i>me</i>,&rsquo; he replied, &lsquo;Famous!&rsquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;I thought it best not to have a party,&rsquo; said Tigg. &lsquo;You feel that?&rsquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Why, what do you call this?&rsquo; retorted Jonas. &lsquo;You don&rsquo;t mean to say you
      do this every day, do you?&rsquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;My dear fellow,&rsquo; said Montague, shrugging his shoulders, &lsquo;every day of my
      life, when I dine at home. This is my common style. It was of no use
      having anything uncommon for you. You&rsquo;d have seen through it. &ldquo;You&rsquo;ll have
      a party?&rdquo; said Crimple. &ldquo;No, I won&rsquo;t,&rdquo; I said, &ldquo;he shall take us in the
      rough!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;And pretty smooth, too, ecod!&rsquo; said Jonas, glancing round the table.
      &lsquo;This don&rsquo;t cost a trifle.&rsquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Why, to be candid with you, it does not,&rsquo; returned the other. &lsquo;But I like
      this sort of thing. It&rsquo;s the way I spend my money.&rsquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      Jonas thrust his tongue into his cheek, and said, &lsquo;Was it?&rsquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;When you join us, you won&rsquo;t get rid of your share of the profits in the
      same way?&rsquo; said Tigg.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Quite different,&rsquo; retorted Jonas.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Well, and you&rsquo;re right,&rsquo; said Tigg, with friendly candour. &lsquo;You needn&rsquo;t.
      It&rsquo;s not necessary. One of a Company must do it to hold the connection
      together; but, as I take a pleasure in it, that&rsquo;s my department. You don&rsquo;t
      mind dining expensively at another man&rsquo;s expense, I hope?&rsquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Not a bit,&rsquo; said Jonas.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Then I hope you&rsquo;ll often dine with me?&rsquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Ah!&rsquo; said Jonas, &lsquo;I don&rsquo;t mind. On the contrary.&rsquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;And I&rsquo;ll never attempt to talk business to you over wine, I take my
      oath,&rsquo; said Tigg. &lsquo;Oh deep, deep, deep of you this morning! I must tell
      &lsquo;em that. They&rsquo;re the very men to enjoy it. Pip, my good fellow, I&rsquo;ve a
      splendid little trait to tell you of my friend Chuzzlewit who is the
      deepest dog I know; I give you my sacred word of honour he is the deepest
      dog I know, Pip!&rsquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      Pip swore a frightful oath that he was sure of it already; and the
      anecdote, being told, was received with loud applause, as an incontestable
      proof of Mr Jonas&rsquo;s greatness. Pip, in a natural spirit of emulation, then
      related some instances of his own depth; and Wolf not to be left
      behind-hand, recited the leading points of one or two vastly humorous
      articles he was then preparing. These lucubrations being of what he called
      &lsquo;a warm complexion,&rsquo; were highly approved; and all the company agreed that
      they were full of point.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Men of the world, my dear sir,&rsquo; Jobling whispered to Jonas; &lsquo;thorough men
      of the world! To a professional person like myself it&rsquo;s quite refreshing
      to come into this kind of society. It&rsquo;s not only agreeable&mdash;and
      nothing <i>can </i>be more agreeable&mdash;but it&rsquo;s philosophically improving.
      It&rsquo;s character, my dear sir; character!&rsquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      It is so pleasant to find real merit appreciated, whatever its particular
      walk in life may be, that the general harmony of the company was doubtless
      much promoted by their knowing that the two men of the world were held in
      great esteem by the upper classes of society, and by the gallant defenders
      of their country in the army and navy, but particularly the former. The
      least of their stories had a colonel in it; lords were as plentiful as
      oaths; and even the Blood Royal ran in the muddy channel of their personal
      recollections.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Mr Chuzzlewit didn&rsquo;t know him, I&rsquo;m afraid,&rsquo; said Wolf, in reference to a
      certain personage of illustrious descent, who had previously figured in a
      reminiscence.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;No,&rsquo; said Tigg. &lsquo;But we must bring him into contact with this sort of
      fellows.&rsquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;He was very fond of literature,&rsquo; observed Wolf.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Was he?&rsquo; said Tigg.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Oh, yes; he took my paper regularly for many years. Do you know he said
      some good things now and then? He asked a certain Viscount, who&rsquo;s a friend
      of mine&mdash;Pip knows him&mdash;&ldquo;What&rsquo;s the editor&rsquo;s name, what&rsquo;s the
      editor&rsquo;s name?&rdquo; &ldquo;Wolf.&rdquo; &ldquo;Wolf, eh? Sharp biter, Wolf. We must keep the
      Wolf from the door, as the proverb says.&rdquo; It was very well. And being
      complimentary, I printed it.&rsquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;But the Viscount&rsquo;s the boy!&rsquo; cried Pip, who invented a new oath for the
      introduction of everything he said. &lsquo;The Viscount&rsquo;s the boy! He came into
      our place one night to take Her home; rather slued, but not much; and
      said, &ldquo;Where&rsquo;s Pip? I want to see Pip. Produce Pip!&rdquo;&mdash;&ldquo;What&rsquo;s the
      row, my lord?&rdquo;&mdash;&ldquo;Shakspeare&rsquo;s an infernal humbug, Pip! What&rsquo;s the
      good of Shakspeare, Pip? I never read him. What the devil is it all about,
      Pip? There&rsquo;s a lot of feet in Shakspeare&rsquo;s verse, but there an&rsquo;t any legs
      worth mentioning in Shakspeare&rsquo;s plays, are there, Pip? Juliet, Desdemona,
      Lady Macbeth, and all the rest of &lsquo;em, whatever their names are, might as
      well have no legs at all, for anything the audience know about it, Pip.
      Why, in that respect they&rsquo;re all Miss Biffins to the audience, Pip. I&rsquo;ll
      tell you what it is. What the people call dramatic poetry is a collection
      of sermons. Do I go to the theatre to be lectured? No, Pip. If I wanted
      that, I&rsquo;d go to church. What&rsquo;s the legitimate object of the drama, Pip?
      Human nature. What are legs? Human nature. Then let us have plenty of leg
      pieces, Pip, and I&rsquo;ll stand by you, my buck!&rdquo; and I am proud to say,&rsquo;
      added Pip, &lsquo;that he <i>did </i>stand by me, handsomely.&rsquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      The conversation now becoming general, Mr Jonas&rsquo;s opinion was requested on
      this subject; and as it was in full accordance with the sentiments of Mr
      Pip, that gentleman was extremely gratified. Indeed, both himself and Wolf
      had so much in common with Jonas, that they became very amicable; and
      between their increasing friendship and the fumes of wine, Jonas grew
      talkative.
    </p>
    <p>
      It does not follow in the case of such a person that the more talkative he
      becomes, the more agreeable he is; on the contrary, his merits show to
      most advantage, perhaps, in silence. Having no means, as he thought, of
      putting himself on an equality with the rest, but by the assertion of that
      depth and sharpness on which he had been complimented, Jonas exhibited
      that faculty to the utmost; and was so deep and sharp that he lost himself
      in his own profundity, and cut his fingers with his own edge-tools.
    </p>
    <p>
      It was especially in his way and character to exhibit his quality at his
      entertainer&rsquo;s expense; and while he drank of his sparkling wines, and
      partook of his monstrous profusion, to ridicule the extravagance which had
      set such costly fare before him. Even at such a wanton board, and in such
      more than doubtful company, this might have proved a disagreeable
      experiment, but that Tigg and Crimple, studying to understand their man
      thoroughly, gave him what license he chose: knowing that the more he took,
      the better for their purpose. And thus while the blundering cheat&mdash;gull
      that he was, for all his cunning&mdash;thought himself rolled up hedgehog
      fashion, with his sharpest points towards them, he was, in fact, betraying
      all his vulnerable parts to their unwinking watchfulness.
    </p>
    <p>
      Whether the two gentlemen who contributed so much to the doctor&rsquo;s
      philosophical knowledge (by the way, the doctor slipped off quietly, after
      swallowing his usual amount of wine) had had their cue distinctly from the
      host, or took it from what they saw and heard, they acted their parts very
      well. They solicited the honour of Jonas&rsquo;s better acquaintance; trusted
      that they would have the pleasure of introducing him into that elevated
      society in which he was so well qualified to shine; and informed him, in
      the most friendly manner that the advantages of their respective
      establishments were entirely at his control. In a word, they said &lsquo;Be one
      of us!&rsquo; And Jonas said he was infinitely obliged to them, and he would be;
      adding within himself, that so long as they &lsquo;stood treat,&rsquo; there was
      nothing he would like better.
    </p>
    <p>
      After coffee, which was served in the drawing-room, there was a short
      interval (mainly sustained by Pip and Wolf) of conversation; rather highly
      spiced and strongly seasoned. When it flagged, Jonas took it up and showed
      considerable humour in appraising the furniture; inquiring whether such an
      article was paid for; what it had originally cost, and the like. In all of
      this, he was, as he considered, desperately hard on Montague, and very
      demonstrative of his own brilliant parts.
    </p>
    <p>
      Some Champagne Punch gave a new though temporary fillip to the
      entertainments of the evening. For after leading to some noisy
      proceedings, which were not intelligible, it ended in the unsteady
      departure of the two gentlemen of the world, and the slumber of Mr Jonas
      upon one of the sofas.
    </p>
    <p>
      As he could not be made to understand where he was, Mr Bailey received
      orders to call a hackney-coach, and take him home; which that young
      gentleman roused himself from an uneasy sleep in the hall to do. It being
      now almost three o&rsquo;clock in the morning.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Is he hooked, do you think?&rsquo; whispered Crimple, as himself and partner
      stood in a distant part of the room observing him as he lay.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Aye!&rsquo; said Tigg, in the same tone. &lsquo;With a strong iron, perhaps. Has
      Nadgett been here to-night?&rsquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Yes. I went out to him. Hearing you had company, he went away.&rsquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Why did he do that?&rsquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;He said he would come back early in the morning, before you were out of
      bed.&rsquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Tell them to be sure and send him up to my bedside. Hush! Here&rsquo;s the boy!
      Now Mr Bailey, take this gentleman home, and see him safely in. Hallo,
      here! Why Chuzzlewit, halloa!&rsquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      They got him upright with some difficulty, and assisted him downstairs,
      where they put his hat upon his head, and tumbled him into the coach. Mr
      Bailey, having shut him in, mounted the box beside the coachman, and
      smoked his cigar with an air of particular satisfaction; the undertaking
      in which he was engaged having a free and sporting character about it,
      which was quite congenial to his taste.
    </p>
    <p>
      Arriving in due time at the house in the City, Mr Bailey jumped down, and
      expressed the lively nature of his feelings in a knock the like of which
      had probably not been heard in that quarter since the great fire of
      London. Going out into the road to observe the effect of this feat, he saw
      that a dim light, previously visible at an upper window, had been already
      removed and was travelling downstairs. To obtain a foreknowledge of the
      bearer of this taper, Mr Bailey skipped back to the door again, and put
      his eye to the keyhole.
    </p>
    <p>
      It was the merry one herself. But sadly, strangely altered! So careworn
      and dejected, so faltering and full of fear; so fallen, humbled, broken;
      that to have seen her quiet in her coffin would have been a less surprise.
    </p>
    <p>
      She set the light upon a bracket in the hall, and laid her hand upon her
      heart; upon her eyes; upon her burning head. Then she came on towards the
      door with such a wild and hurried step that Mr Bailey lost his
      self-possession, and still had his eye where the keyhole had been, when
      she opened it.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Aha!&rsquo; said Mr Bailey, with an effort. &lsquo;There you are, are you? What&rsquo;s the
      matter? Ain&rsquo;t you well, though?&rsquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      In the midst of her astonishment as she recognized him in his altered
      dress, so much of her old smile came back to her face that Bailey was
      glad. But next moment he was sorry again, for he saw tears standing in her
      poor dim eyes.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Don&rsquo;t be frightened,&rsquo; said Bailey. &lsquo;There ain&rsquo;t nothing the matter. I&rsquo;ve
      brought home Mr Chuzzlewit. He ain&rsquo;t ill. He&rsquo;s only a little swipey, you
      know.&rsquo; Mr Bailey reeled in his boots, to express intoxication.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Have you come from Mrs Todgers&rsquo;s?&rsquo; asked Merry, trembling.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Todgers&rsquo;s, bless you! No!&rsquo; cried Mr Bailey. &lsquo;I haven&rsquo;t got nothin, to do
      with Todgers&rsquo;s. I cut that connection long ago. He&rsquo;s been a-dining with my
      governor at the west-end. Didn&rsquo;t you know he was a-coming to see us?&rsquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;No,&rsquo; she said, faintly.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Oh yes! We&rsquo;re heavy swells too, and so I tell you. Don&rsquo;t you come out,
      a-catching cold in your head. I&rsquo;ll wake him!&rsquo; Mr Bailey expressing in his
      demeanour a perfect confidence that he could carry him in with ease, if
      necessary, opened the coach door, let down the steps, and giving Jonas a
      shake, cried &lsquo;We&rsquo;ve got home, my flower! Tumble up, then!&rsquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      He was so far recovered as to be able to respond to this appeal, and to
      come stumbling out of the coach in a heap, to the great hazard of Mr
      Bailey&rsquo;s person. When he got upon the pavement, Mr Bailey first butted at
      him in front, and then dexterously propped him up behind; and having
      steadied him by these means, he assisted him into the house.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;You go up first with the light,&rsquo; said Bailey to Mr Jonas, &lsquo;and we&rsquo;ll
      foller. Don&rsquo;t tremble so. He won&rsquo;t hurt you. When I&rsquo;ve had a drop too
      much, I&rsquo;m full of good natur myself.&rsquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      She went on before; and her husband and Bailey, by dint of tumbling over
      each other, and knocking themselves about, got at last into the
      sitting-room above stairs, where Jonas staggered into a seat.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;There!&rsquo; said Mr Bailey. &lsquo;He&rsquo;s all right now. You ain&rsquo;t got nothing to cry
      for, bless you! He&rsquo;s righter than a trivet!&rsquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      The ill-favoured brute, with dress awry, and sodden face, and rumpled
      hair, sat blinking and drooping, and rolling his idiotic eyes about,
      until, becoming conscious by degrees, he recognized his wife, and shook
      his fist at her.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Ah!&rsquo; cried Mr Bailey, squaring his arms with a sudden emotion. &lsquo;What,
      you&rsquo;re wicious, are you? Would you though! You&rsquo;d better not!&rsquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Pray, go away!&rsquo; said Merry. &lsquo;Bailey, my good boy, go home. Jonas!&rsquo; she
      said; timidly laying her hand upon his shoulder, and bending her head down
      over him. &lsquo;Jonas!&rsquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Look at her!&rsquo; cried Jonas, pushing her off with his extended arm. &lsquo;Look
      here! Look at her! Here&rsquo;s a bargain for a man!&rsquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Dear Jonas!&rsquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Dear Devil!&rsquo; he replied, with a fierce gesture. &lsquo;You&rsquo;re a pretty clog to
      be tied to a man for life, you mewling, white-faced cat! Get out of my
      sight!&rsquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;I know you don&rsquo;t mean it, Jonas. You wouldn&rsquo;t say it if you were sober.&rsquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      With affected gayety she gave Bailey a piece of money, and again implored
      him to be gone. Her entreaty was so earnest, that the boy had not the
      heart to stay there. But he stopped at the bottom of the stairs, and
      listened.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;I wouldn&rsquo;t say it if I was sober!&rsquo; retorted Jonas. &lsquo;You know better. Have
      I never said it when I was sober?&rsquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Often, indeed!&rsquo; she answered through her tears.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Hark ye!&rsquo; cried Jonas, stamping his foot upon the ground. &lsquo;You made me
      bear your pretty humours once, and ecod I&rsquo;ll make you bear mine now. I
      always promised myself I would. I married you that I might. I&rsquo;ll know
      who&rsquo;s master, and who&rsquo;s slave!&rsquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Heaven knows I am obedient!&rsquo; said the sobbing girl. &lsquo;Much more so than I
      ever thought to be!&rsquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      Jonas laughed in his drunken exultation. &lsquo;What! you&rsquo;re finding it out, are
      you! Patience, and you will in time! Griffins have claws, my girl. There&rsquo;s
      not a pretty slight you ever put upon me, nor a pretty trick you ever
      played me, nor a pretty insolence you ever showed me, that I won&rsquo;t pay
      back a hundred-fold. What else did I marry you for? <i>you</i>, too!&rsquo; he said,
      with coarse contempt.
    </p>
    <p>
      It might have softened him&mdash;indeed it might&mdash;to hear her turn a
      little fragment of a song he used to say he liked; trying, with a heart so
      full, to win him back.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Oho!&rsquo; he said, &lsquo;you&rsquo;re deaf, are you? You don&rsquo;t hear me, eh? So much the
      better for you. I hate you. I hate myself, for having, been fool enough to
      strap a pack upon my back for the pleasure of treading on it whenever I
      choose. Why, things have opened to me, now, so that I might marry almost
      where I liked. But I wouldn&rsquo;t; I&rsquo;d keep single. I ought to be single,
      among the friends I know. Instead of that, here I am, tied like a log to
      you. Pah! Why do you show your pale face when I come home? Am I never to
      forget you?&rsquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;How late it is!&rsquo; she said cheerfully, opening the shutter after an
      interval of silence. &lsquo;Broad day, Jonas!&rsquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Broad day or black night, what do I care!&rsquo; was the kind rejoinder.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;The night passed quickly, too. I don&rsquo;t mind sitting up, at all.&rsquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Sit up for me again, if you dare!&rsquo; growled Jonas.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;I was reading,&rsquo; she proceeded, &lsquo;all night long. I began when you went
      out, and read till you came home again. The strangest story, Jonas! And
      true, the book says. I&rsquo;ll tell it you to-morrow.&rsquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;True, was it?&rsquo; said Jonas, doggedly.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;So the book says.&rsquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Was there anything in it, about a man&rsquo;s being determined to conquer his
      wife, break her spirit, bend her temper, crush all her humours like so
      many nut-shells&mdash;kill her, for aught I know?&rsquo; said Jonas.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;No. Not a word,&rsquo; she answered quickly.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Oh!&rsquo; he returned. &lsquo;That&rsquo;ll be a true story though, before long; for all
      the book says nothing about it. It&rsquo;s a lying book, I see. A fit book for a
      lying reader. But you&rsquo;re deaf. I forgot that.&rsquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      There was another interval of silence; and the boy was stealing away, when
      he heard her footstep on the floor, and stopped. She went up to him, as it
      seemed, and spoke lovingly; saying that she would defer to him in
      everything and would consult his wishes and obey them, and they might be
      very happy if he would be gentle with her. He answered with an
      imprecation, and&mdash;
    </p>
    <p>
      Not with a blow? Yes. Stern truth against the base-souled villain; with a
      blow.
    </p>
    <p>
      No angry cries; no loud reproaches. Even her weeping and her sobs were
      stifled by her clinging round him. She only said, repeating it in agony of
      heart, how could he, could he, could he&mdash;and lost utterance in tears.
    </p>
    <p>
      Oh woman, God beloved in old Jerusalem! The best among us need deal
      lightly with thy faults, if only for the punishment thy nature will
      endure, in bearing heavy evidence against us, on the Day of Judgment!

      CHAPTER TWENTY-NINE
    </h2>
    <p>
      IN WHICH SOME PEOPLE ARE PRECOCIOUS, OTHERS PROFESSIONAL, AND OTHERS
      MYSTERIOUS; ALL IN THEIR SEVERAL WAYS
    </p>
    <p>
      It may have been the restless remembrance of what he had seen and heard
      overnight, or it may have been no deeper mental operation than the
      discovery that he had nothing to do, which caused Mr Bailey, on the
      following afternoon, to feel particularly disposed for agreeable society,
      and prompted him to pay a visit to his friend Poll Sweedlepipe.
    </p>
    <p>
      On the little bell giving clamorous notice of a visitor&rsquo;s approach (for Mr
      Bailey came in at the door with a lunge, to get as much sound out of the
      bell as possible), Poll Sweedlepipe desisted from the contemplation of a
      favourite owl, and gave his young friend hearty welcome.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Why, you look smarter by day,&rsquo; said Poll, &lsquo;than you do by candle-light. I
      never see such a tight young dasher.&rsquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Reether so, Polly. How&rsquo;s our fair friend, Sairah?&rsquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Oh, she&rsquo;s pretty well,&rsquo; said Poll. &lsquo;She&rsquo;s at home.&rsquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;There&rsquo;s the remains of a fine woman about Sairah, Poll,&rsquo; observed Mr
      Bailey, with genteel indifference.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Oh!&rsquo; thought Poll, &lsquo;he&rsquo;s old. He must be very old!&rsquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Too much crumb, you know,&rsquo; said Mr Bailey; &lsquo;too fat, Poll. But there&rsquo;s
      many worse at her time of life.&rsquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;The very owl&rsquo;s a-opening his eyes!&rsquo; thought Poll. &lsquo;I don&rsquo;t wonder at it
      in a bird of his opinions.&rsquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      He happened to have been sharpening his razors, which were lying open in a
      row, while a huge strop dangled from the wall. Glancing at these
      preparations, Mr Bailey stroked his chin, and a thought appeared to occur
      to him.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Poll,&rsquo; he said, &lsquo;I ain&rsquo;t as neat as I could wish about the gills. Being
      here, I may as well have a shave, and get trimmed close.&rsquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      The barber stood aghast; but Mr Bailey divested himself of his neck-cloth,
      and sat down in the easy shaving chair with all the dignity and confidence
      in life. There was no resisting his manner. The evidence of sight and
      touch became as nothing. His chin was as smooth as a new-laid egg or a
      scraped Dutch cheese; but Poll Sweedlepipe wouldn&rsquo;t have ventured to deny,
      on affidavit, that he had the beard of a Jewish rabbi.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Go <i>with </i>the grain, Poll, all round, please,&rsquo; said Mr Bailey, screwing up
      his face for the reception of the lather. &lsquo;You may do wot you like with
      the bits of whisker. I don&rsquo;t care for &lsquo;em.&rsquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      The meek little barber stood gazing at him with the brush and soap-dish in
      his hand, stirring them round and round in a ludicrous uncertainty, as if
      he were disabled by some fascination from beginning. At last he made a
      dash at Mr Bailey&rsquo;s cheek. Then he stopped again, as if the ghost of a
      beard had suddenly receded from his touch; but receiving mild
      encouragement from Mr Bailey, in the form of an adjuration to &lsquo;Go in and
      win,&rsquo; he lathered him bountifully. Mr Bailey smiled through the suds in
      his satisfaction. &lsquo;Gently over the stones, Poll. Go a tip-toe over the
      pimples!&rsquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      Poll Sweedlepipe obeyed, and scraped the lather off again with particular
      care. Mr Bailey squinted at every successive dab, as it was deposited on a
      cloth on his left shoulder, and seemed, with a microscopic eye, to detect
      some bristles in it; for he murmured more than once &lsquo;Reether redder than I
      could wish, Poll.&rsquo; The operation being concluded, Poll fell back and
      stared at him again, while Mr Bailey, wiping his face on the jack-towel,
      remarked, &lsquo;that arter late hours nothing freshened up a man so much as a
      easy shave.&rsquo;
    </p>

    <p>
      He was in the act of tying his cravat at the glass, without his coat, and
      Poll had wiped his razor, ready for the next customer, when Mrs Gamp,
      coming downstairs, looked in at the shop-door to give the barber
      neighbourly good day. Feeling for her unfortunate situation, in having
      conceived a regard for himself which it was not in the nature of things
      that he could return, Mr Bailey hastened to soothe her with words of
      kindness.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Hallo!&rsquo; he said, &lsquo;Sairah! I needn&rsquo;t ask you how you&rsquo;ve been this long
      time, for you&rsquo;re in full bloom. All a-blowin and a-growin; ain&rsquo;t she,
      Polly?&rsquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Why, drat the Bragian boldness of that boy!&rsquo; cried Mrs Gamp, though not
      displeased. &lsquo;What a imperent young sparrow it is! I wouldn&rsquo;t be that
      creetur&rsquo;s mother not for fifty pound!&rsquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      Mr Bailey regarded this as a delicate confession of her attachment, and a
      hint that no pecuniary gain could recompense her for its being rendered
      hopeless. He felt flattered. Disinterested affection is always flattering.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Ah, dear!&rsquo; moaned Mrs Gamp, sinking into the shaving chair, &lsquo;that there
      blessed Bull, Mr Sweedlepipe, has done his wery best to conker me. Of all
      the trying inwalieges in this walley of the shadder, that one beats &lsquo;em
      black and blue.&rsquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      It was the practice of Mrs Gamp and her friends in the profession, to say
      this of all the easy customers; as having at once the effect of
      discouraging competitors for office, and accounting for the necessity of
      high living on the part of the nurses.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Talk of constitooshun!&rsquo; Mrs Gamp observed. &lsquo;A person&rsquo;s constitooshun need
      be made of bricks to stand it. Mrs Harris jestly says to me, but t&rsquo;other
      day, &ldquo;Oh! Sairey Gamp,&rdquo; she says, &ldquo;how is it done?&rdquo; &ldquo;Mrs Harris, ma&rsquo;am,&rdquo; I
      says to her, &ldquo;we gives no trust ourselves, and puts a deal o&rsquo;trust
      elsevere; these is our religious feelins, and we finds &lsquo;em answer.&rdquo;
       &ldquo;Sairey,&rdquo; says Mrs Harris, &ldquo;sech is life. Vich likeways is the hend of all
      things!&rdquo;&rsquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      The barber gave a soft murmur, as much as to say that Mrs Harris&rsquo;s remark,
      though perhaps not quite so intelligible as could be desired from such an
      authority, did equal honour to her head and to her heart.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;And here,&rsquo; continued Mrs Gamp, &lsquo;and here am I a-goin twenty mile in
      distant, on as wentersome a chance as ever any one as monthlied ever run,
      I do believe. Says Mrs Harris, with a woman&rsquo;s and a mother&rsquo;s art a-beatin
      in her human breast, she says to me, &ldquo;You&rsquo;re not a-goin, Sairey, Lord
      forgive you!&rdquo; &ldquo;Why am I not a-goin, Mrs Harris?&rdquo; I replies. &ldquo;Mrs Gill,&rdquo; I
      says, &ldquo;wos never wrong with six; and is it likely, ma&rsquo;am&mdash;I ast you
      as a mother&mdash;that she will begin to be unreg&rsquo;lar now? Often and often
      have I heerd him say,&rdquo; I says to Mrs Harris, meaning Mr Gill, &ldquo;that he
      would back his wife agen Moore&rsquo;s almanack, to name the very day and hour,
      for ninepence farden. <i>is</i> it likely, ma&rsquo;am,&rdquo; I says, &ldquo;as she will fail this
      once?&rdquo; Says Mrs Harris &ldquo;No, ma&rsquo;am, not in the course of natur. But,&rdquo; she
      says, the tears a-fillin in her eyes, &ldquo;you knows much betterer than me,
      with your experienge, how little puts us out. A Punch&rsquo;s show,&rdquo; she says,
      &ldquo;a chimbley sweep, a newfundlan dog, or a drunkin man a-comin round the
      corner sharp may do it.&rdquo; So it may, Mr Sweedlepipes,&rsquo; said Mrs Gamp,
      &lsquo;there&rsquo;s no deniging of it; and though my books is clear for a full week,
      I takes a anxious art along with me, I do assure you, sir.&rsquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;You&rsquo;re so full of zeal, you see!&rsquo; said Poll. &lsquo;You worrit yourself so.&rsquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Worrit myself!&rsquo; cried Mrs Gamp, raising her hands and turning up her
      eyes. &lsquo;You speak truth in that, sir, if you never speaks no more &lsquo;twixt
      this and when two Sundays jines together. I feels the sufferins of other
      people more than I feels my own, though no one mayn&rsquo;t suppoge it. The
      families I&rsquo;ve had,&rsquo; said Mrs Gamp, &lsquo;if all was knowd and credit done where
      credit&rsquo;s doo, would take a week to chris&rsquo;en at Saint Polge&rsquo;s fontin!&rsquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Where&rsquo;s the patient goin?&rsquo; asked Sweedlepipe.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Into Har&rsquo;fordshire, which is his native air. But native airs nor native
      graces neither,&rsquo; Mrs Gamp observed, &lsquo;won&rsquo;t bring <i>him </i>round.&rsquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;So bad as that?&rsquo; inquired the wistful barber. &lsquo;Indeed!&rsquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      Mrs Gamp shook her head mysteriously, and pursed up her lips. &lsquo;There&rsquo;s
      fevers of the mind,&rsquo; she said, &lsquo;as well as body. You may take your slime
      drafts till you flies into the air with efferwescence; but you won&rsquo;t cure
      that.&rsquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Ah!&rsquo; said the barber, opening his eyes, and putting on his raven aspect;
      &lsquo;Lor!&rsquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;No. You may make yourself as light as any gash balloon,&rsquo; said Mrs Gamp.
      &lsquo;But talk, when you&rsquo;re wrong in your head and when you&rsquo;re in your sleep,
      of certain things; and you&rsquo;ll be heavy in your mind.&rsquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Of what kind of things now?&rsquo; inquired Poll, greedily biting his nails in
      his great interest. &lsquo;Ghosts?&rsquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      Mrs Gamp, who perhaps had been already tempted further than she had
      intended to go, by the barber&rsquo;s stimulating curiosity, gave a sniff of
      uncommon significance, and said, it didn&rsquo;t signify.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;I&rsquo;m a-goin down with my patient in the coach this arternoon,&rsquo; she
      proceeded. &lsquo;I&rsquo;m a-goin to stop with him a day or so, till he gets a
      country nuss (drat them country nusses, much the orkard hussies knows
      about their bis&rsquo;ness); and then I&rsquo;m a-comin back; and that&rsquo;s my trouble,
      Mr Sweedlepipes. But I hope that everythink&rsquo;ll only go on right and
      comfortable as long as I&rsquo;m away; perwisin which, as Mrs Harris says, Mrs
      Gill is welcome to choose her own time; all times of the day and night
      bein&rsquo; equally the same to me.&rsquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      During the progress of the foregoing remarks, which Mrs Gamp had addressed
      exclusively to the barber, Mr Bailey had been tying his cravat, getting on
      his coat, and making hideous faces at himself in the glass. Being now
      personally addressed by Mrs Gamp, he turned round, and mingled in the
      conversation.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;You ain&rsquo;t been in the City, I suppose, sir, since we was all three there
      together,&rsquo; said Mrs Gamp, &lsquo;at Mr Chuzzlewit&rsquo;s?&rsquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Yes, I have, Sairah. I was there last night.&rsquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Last night!&rsquo; cried the barber.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Yes, Poll, reether so. You can call it this morning, if you like to be
      particular. He dined with us.&rsquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Who does that young Limb mean by &ldquo;hus?&rdquo;&rsquo; said Mrs Gamp, with most
      impatient emphasis.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Me and my Governor, Sairah. He dined at our house. We wos very merry,
      Sairah. So much so, that I was obliged to see him home in a hackney coach
      at three o&rsquo;clock in the morning.&rsquo; It was on the tip of the boy&rsquo;s tongue to
      relate what had followed; but remembering how easily it might be carried
      to his master&rsquo;s ears, and the repeated cautions he had had from Mr Crimple
      &lsquo;not to chatter,&rsquo; he checked himself; adding, only, &lsquo;She was sitting up,
      expecting him.&rsquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;And all things considered,&rsquo; said Mrs Gamp sharply, &lsquo;she might have know&rsquo;d
      better than to go a-tirin herself out, by doin&rsquo; anythink of the sort. Did
      they seem pretty pleasant together, sir?&rsquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Oh, yes,&rsquo; answered Bailey, &lsquo;pleasant enough.&rsquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;I&rsquo;m glad on it,&rsquo; said Mrs Gamp, with a second sniff of significance.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;They haven&rsquo;t been married so long,&rsquo; observed Poll, rubbing his hands,
      &lsquo;that they need be anything but pleasant yet awhile.&rsquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;No,&rsquo; said Mrs Gamp, with a third significant signal.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Especially,&rsquo; pursued the barber, &lsquo;when the gentleman bears such a
      character as you gave him.&rsquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;I speak; as I find, Mr Sweedlepipes,&rsquo; said Mrs Gamp. &lsquo;Forbid it should be
      otherways! But we never knows wot&rsquo;s hidden in each other&rsquo;s hearts; and if
      we had glass winders there, we&rsquo;d need keep the shetters up, some on us, I
      do assure you!&rsquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;But you don&rsquo;t mean to say&mdash;&rsquo; Poll Sweedlepipe began.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;No,&rsquo; said Mrs Gamp, cutting him very short, &lsquo;I don&rsquo;t. Don&rsquo;t think I do.
      The torters of the Imposition shouldn&rsquo;t make me own I did. All I says is,&rsquo;
      added the good woman, rising and folding her shawl about her, &lsquo;that the
      Bull&rsquo;s a-waitin, and the precious moments is a-flyin&rsquo; fast.&rsquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      The little barber having in his eager curiosity a great desire to see Mrs
      Gamp&rsquo;s patient, proposed to Mr Bailey that they should accompany her to
      the Bull, and witness the departure of the coach. That young gentleman
      assenting, they all went out together.
    </p>
    <p>
      Arriving at the tavern, Mrs Gamp (who was full-dressed for the journey, in
      her latest suit of mourning) left her friends to entertain themselves in
      the yard, while she ascended to the sick room, where her fellow-labourer
      Mrs Prig was dressing the invalid.
    </p>
    <p>
      He was so wasted, that it seemed as if his bones would rattle when they
      moved him. His cheeks were sunken, and his eyes unnaturally large. He lay
      back in the easy-chair like one more dead than living; and rolled his
      languid eyes towards the door when Mrs Gamp appeared, as painfully as if
      their weight alone were burdensome to move.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;And how are we by this time?&rsquo; Mrs Gamp observed. &lsquo;We looks charming.&rsquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;We looks a deal charminger than we are, then,&rsquo; returned Mrs Prig, a
      little chafed in her temper. &lsquo;We got out of bed back&rsquo;ards, I think, for
      we&rsquo;re as cross as two sticks. I never see sich a man. He wouldn&rsquo;t have
      been washed, if he&rsquo;d had his own way.&rsquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;She put the soap in my mouth,&rsquo; said the unfortunate patient feebly.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Couldn&rsquo;t you keep it shut then?&rsquo; retorted Mrs Prig. &lsquo;Who do you think&rsquo;s
      to wash one feater, and miss another, and wear one&rsquo;s eyes out with all
      manner of fine work of that description, for half-a-crown a day! If you
      wants to be tittivated, you must pay accordin&rsquo;.&rsquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Oh dear me!&rsquo; cried the patient, &lsquo;oh dear, dear!&rsquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;There!&rsquo; said Mrs Prig, &lsquo;that&rsquo;s the way he&rsquo;s been a-conductin of himself,
      Sarah, ever since I got him out of bed, if you&rsquo;ll believe it.&rsquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Instead of being grateful,&rsquo; Mrs Gamp observed, &lsquo;for all our little ways.
      Oh, fie for shame, sir, fie for shame!&rsquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      Here Mrs Prig seized the patient by the chin, and began to rasp his
      unhappy head with a hair-brush.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;I suppose you don&rsquo;t like that, neither!&rsquo; she observed, stopping to look
      at him.
    </p>
    <p>
      It was just possible that he didn&rsquo;t for the brush was a specimen of the
      hardest kind of instrument producible by modern art; and his very eyelids
      were red with the friction. Mrs Prig was gratified to observe the
      correctness of her supposition, and said triumphantly &lsquo;she know&rsquo;d as
      much.&rsquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      When his hair was smoothed down comfortably into his eyes, Mrs Prig and
      Mrs Gamp put on his neckerchief; adjusting his shirt collar with great
      nicety, so that the starched points should also invade those organs, and
      afflict them with an artificial ophthalmia. His waistcoat and coat were
      next arranged; and as every button was wrenched into a wrong button-hole,
      and the order of his boots was reversed, he presented on the whole rather
      a melancholy appearance.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;I don&rsquo;t think it&rsquo;s right,&rsquo; said the poor weak invalid. &lsquo;I feel as if I
      was in somebody else&rsquo;s clothes. I&rsquo;m all on one side; and you&rsquo;ve made one
      of my legs shorter than the other. There&rsquo;s a bottle in my pocket too. What
      do you make me sit upon a bottle for?&rsquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Deuce take the man!&rsquo; cried Mrs Gamp, drawing it forth. &lsquo;If he ain&rsquo;t been
      and got my night-bottle here. I made a little cupboard of his coat when it
      hung behind the door, and quite forgot it, Betsey. You&rsquo;ll find a ingun or
      two, and a little tea and sugar in his t&rsquo;other pocket, my dear, if you&rsquo;ll
      just be good enough to take &lsquo;em out.&rsquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      Betsey produced the property in question, together with some other
      articles of general chandlery; and Mrs Gamp transferred them to her own
      pocket, which was a species of nankeen pannier. Refreshment then arrived
      in the form of chops and strong ale for the ladies, and a basin of
      beef-tea for the patient; which refection was barely at an end when John
      Westlock appeared.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Up and dressed!&rsquo; cried John, sitting down beside him. &lsquo;That&rsquo;s brave. How
      do you feel?&rsquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Much better. But very weak.&rsquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;No wonder. You have had a hard bout of it. But country air, and change of
      scene,&rsquo; said John, &lsquo;will make another man of you! Why, Mrs Gamp,&rsquo; he
      added, laughing, as he kindly arranged the sick man&rsquo;s garments, &lsquo;you have
      odd notions of a gentleman&rsquo;s dress!&rsquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Mr Lewsome an&rsquo;t a easy gent to get into his clothes, sir,&rsquo; Mrs Gamp
      replied with dignity; &lsquo;as me and Betsey Prig can certify afore the Lord
      Mayor and Uncommon Counsellors, if needful!&rsquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      John at that moment was standing close in front of the sick man, in the
      act of releasing him from the torture of the collars before mentioned,
      when he said in a whisper:
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Mr Westlock! I don&rsquo;t wish to be overheard. I have something very
      particular and strange to say to you; something that has been a dreadful
      weight on my mind, through this long illness.&rsquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      Quick in all his motions, John was turning round to desire the women to
      leave the room; when the sick man held him by the sleeve.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Not now. I&rsquo;ve not the strength. I&rsquo;ve not the courage. May I tell it when
      I have? May I write it, if I find that easier and better?&rsquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;May you!&rsquo; cried John. &lsquo;Why, Lewsome, what is this!&rsquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Don&rsquo;t ask me what it is. It&rsquo;s unnatural and cruel. Frightful to think of.
      Frightful to tell. Frightful to know. Frightful to have helped in. Let me
      kiss your hand for all your goodness to me. Be kinder still, and don&rsquo;t ask
      me what it is!&rsquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      At first, John gazed at him in great surprise; but remembering how very
      much reduced he was, and how recently his brain had been on fire with
      fever, believed that he was labouring under some imaginary horror or
      despondent fancy. For farther information on this point, he took an
      opportunity of drawing Mrs Gamp aside, while Betsey Prig was wrapping him
      in cloaks and shawls, and asked her whether he was quite collected in his
      mind.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Oh bless you, no!&rsquo; said Mrs Gamp. &lsquo;He hates his nusses to this hour. They
      always does it, sir. It&rsquo;s a certain sign. If you could have heerd the poor
      dear soul a-findin fault with me and Betsey Prig, not half an hour ago,
      you would have wondered how it is we don&rsquo;t get fretted to the tomb.&rsquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      This almost confirmed John in his suspicion; so, not taking what had
      passed into any serious account, he resumed his former cheerful manner,
      and assisted by Mrs Gamp and Betsey Prig, conducted Lewsome downstairs to
      the coach; just then upon the point of starting. Poll Sweedlepipe was at
      the door with his arms tight folded and his eyes wide open, and looked on
      with absorbing interest, while the sick man was slowly moved into the
      vehicle. His bony hands and haggard face impressed Poll wonderfully; and
      he informed Mr Bailey in confidence, that he wouldn&rsquo;t have missed seeing
      him for a pound. Mr Bailey, who was of a different constitution, remarked
      that he would have stayed away for five shillings.
    </p>
    <p>
      It was a troublesome matter to adjust Mrs Gamp&rsquo;s luggage to her
      satisfaction; for every package belonging to that lady had the
      inconvenient property of requiring to be put in a boot by itself, and to
      have no other luggage near it, on pain of actions at law for heavy damages
      against the proprietors of the coach. The umbrella with the circular patch
      was particularly hard to be got rid of, and several times thrust out its
      battered brass nozzle from improper crevices and chinks, to the great
      terror of the other passengers. Indeed, in her intense anxiety to find a
      haven of refuge for this chattel, Mrs Gamp so often moved it, in the
      course of five minutes, that it seemed not one umbrella but fifty. At
      length it was lost, or said to be; and for the next five minutes she was
      face to face with the coachman, go wherever he might, protesting that it
      should be &lsquo;made good,&rsquo; though she took the question to the House of
      Commons.
    </p>
    <p>
      At last, her bundle, and her pattens, and her basket, and everything else,
      being disposed of, she took a friendly leave of Poll and Mr Bailey,
      dropped a curtsey to John Westlock, and parted as from a cherished member
      of the sisterhood with Betsey Prig.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Wishin you lots of sickness, my darlin creetur,&rsquo; Mrs Gamp observed, &lsquo;and
      good places. It won&rsquo;t be long, I hope, afore we works together, off and
      on, again, Betsey; and may our next meetin&rsquo; be at a large family&rsquo;s, where
      they all takes it reg&rsquo;lar, one from another, turn and turn about, and has
      it business-like.&rsquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;I don&rsquo;t care how soon it is,&rsquo; said Mrs Prig; &lsquo;nor how many weeks it
      lasts.&rsquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      Mrs Gamp with a reply in a congenial spirit was backing to the coach, when
      she came in contact with a lady and gentleman who were passing along the
      footway.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Take care, take care here!&rsquo; cried the gentleman. &lsquo;Halloo! My dear! Why,
      it&rsquo;s Mrs Gamp!&rsquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;What, Mr Mould!&rsquo; exclaimed the nurse. &lsquo;And Mrs Mould! who would have
      thought as we should ever have a meetin&rsquo; here, I&rsquo;m sure!&rsquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Going out of town, Mrs Gamp?&rsquo; cried Mould. &lsquo;That&rsquo;s unusual, isn&rsquo;t it?&rsquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;It <i>is</i> unusual, sir,&rsquo; said Mrs Gamp. &lsquo;But only for a day or two at most.
      The gent,&rsquo; she whispered, &lsquo;as I spoke about.&rsquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;What, in the coach!&rsquo; cried Mould. &lsquo;The one you thought of recommending?
      Very odd. My dear, this will interest you. The gentleman that Mrs Gamp
      thought likely to suit us is in the coach, my love.&rsquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      Mrs Mould was greatly interested.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Here, my dear. You can stand upon the door-step,&rsquo; said Mould, &lsquo;and take a
      look at him. Ha! There he is. Where&rsquo;s my glass? Oh! all right. I&rsquo;ve got
      it. Do you see him, my dear?&rsquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Quite plain,&rsquo; said Mrs Mould.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Upon my life, you know, this is a very singular circumstance,&rsquo; said
      Mould, quite delighted. &lsquo;This is the sort of thing, my dear, I wouldn&rsquo;t
      have missed on any account. It tickles one. It&rsquo;s interesting. It&rsquo;s almost
      a little play, you know. Ah! There he is! To be sure. Looks poorly, Mrs
      M., don&rsquo;t he?&rsquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      Mrs Mould assented.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;He&rsquo;s coming our way, perhaps, after all,&rsquo; said Mould. &lsquo;Who knows! I feel
      as if I ought to show him some little attention, really. He don&rsquo;t seem a
      stranger to me. I&rsquo;m very much inclined to move my hat, my dear.&rsquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;He&rsquo;s looking hard this way,&rsquo; said Mrs Mould.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Then I will!&rsquo; cried Mould. &lsquo;How d&rsquo;ye do, sir! I wish you good day. Ha! He
      bows too. Very gentlemanly. Mrs Gamp has the cards in her pocket, I have
      no doubt. This is very singular, my dear&mdash;and very pleasant. I am not
      superstitious, but it really seems as if one was destined to pay him those
      little melancholy civilities which belong to our peculiar line of
      business. There can be no kind of objection to your kissing your hand to
      him, my dear.&rsquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      Mrs Mould did so.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Ha!&rsquo; said Mould. &lsquo;He&rsquo;s evidently gratified. Poor fellow! I am quite glad
      you did it, my love. Bye bye, Mrs Gamp!&rsquo; waving his hand. &lsquo;There he goes;
      there he goes!&rsquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      So he did; for the coach rolled off as the words were spoken. Mr and Mrs
      Mould, in high good humour, went their merry way. Mr Bailey retired with
      Poll Sweedlepipe as soon as possible; but some little time elapsed before
      he could remove his friend from the ground, owing to the impression
      wrought upon the barber&rsquo;s nerves by Mrs Prig, whom he pronounced, in
      admiration of her beard, to be a woman of transcendent charms.
    </p>
    <p>
      When the light cloud of bustle hanging round the coach was thus dispersed,
      Nadgett was seen in the darkest box of the Bull coffee-room, looking
      wistfully up at the clock&mdash;as if the man who never appeared were a
      little behind his time.

      CHAPTER THIRTY
    </h2>
    <p>
      PROVES THAT CHANGES MAY BE RUNG IN THE BEST-REGULATED FAMILIES, AND THAT
      MR PECKNIFF WAS A SPECIAL HAND AT A TRIPLE-BOB-MAJOR
    </p>
    <p>
      As the surgeon&rsquo;s first care after amputating a limb, is to take up the
      arteries the cruel knife has severed, so it is the duty of this history,
      which in its remorseless course has cut from the Pecksniffian trunk its
      right arm, Mercy, to look to the parent stem, and see how in all its
      various ramifications it got on without her.
    </p>
    <p>
      And first of Mr Pecksniff it may be observed, that having provided for his
      youngest daughter that choicest of blessings, a tender and indulgent
      husband; and having gratified the dearest wish of his parental heart by
      establishing her in life so happily; he renewed his youth, and spreading
      the plumage of his own bright conscience, felt himself equal to all kinds
      of flights. It is customary with fathers in stage-plays, after giving
      their daughters to the men of their hearts, to congratulate themselves on
      having no other business on their hands but to die immediately; though it
      is rarely found that they are in a hurry to do it. Mr Pecksniff, being a
      father of a more sage and practical class, appeared to think that his
      immediate business was to live; and having deprived himself of one
      comfort, to surround himself with others.
    </p>
    <p>
      But however much inclined the good man was to be jocose and playful, and
      in the garden of his fancy to disport himself (if one may say so) like an
      architectural kitten, he had one impediment constantly opposed to him. The
      gentle Cherry, stung by a sense of slight and injury, which far from
      softening down or wearing out, rankled and festered in her heart&mdash;the
      gentle Cherry was in flat rebellion. She waged fierce war against her dear
      papa, she led her parent what is usually called, for want of a better
      figure of speech, the life of a dog. But never did that dog live, in
      kennel, stable-yard, or house, whose life was half as hard as Mr
      Pecksniff&rsquo;s with his gentle child.
    </p>
    <p>
      The father and daughter were sitting at their breakfast. Tom had retired,
      and they were alone. Mr Pecksniff frowned at first; but having cleared his
      brow, looked stealthily at his child. Her nose was very red indeed, and
      screwed up tight, with hostile preparation.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Cherry,&rsquo; cried Mr Pecksniff, &lsquo;what is amiss between us? My child, why are
      we disunited?&rsquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      Miss Pecksniff&rsquo;s answer was scarcely a response to this gush of affection,
      for it was simply, &lsquo;Bother, Pa!&rsquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Bother!&rsquo; repeated Mr Pecksniff, in a tone of anguish.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Oh! &lsquo;tis too late, Pa,&rsquo; said his daughter, calmly &lsquo;to talk to me like
      this. I know what it means, and what its value is.&rsquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;This is hard!&rsquo; cried Mr Pecksniff, addressing his breakfast-cup. &lsquo;This is
      very hard! She is my child. I carried her in my arms when she wore
      shapeless worsted shoes&mdash;I might say, mufflers&mdash;many years ago!&rsquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;You needn&rsquo;t taunt me with that, Pa,&rsquo; retorted Cherry, with a spiteful
      look. &lsquo;I am not so many years older than my sister, either, though she <i>is</i>
      married to your friend!&rsquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Ah, human nature, human nature! Poor human nature!&rsquo; said Mr Pecksniff,
      shaking his head at human nature, as if he didn&rsquo;t belong to it. &lsquo;To think
      that this discord should arise from such a cause! oh dear, oh dear!&rsquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;From such a cause indeed!&rsquo; cried Cherry. &lsquo;State the real cause, Pa, or
      I&rsquo;ll state it myself. Mind! I will!&rsquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      Perhaps the energy with which she said this was infectious. However that
      may be, Mr Pecksniff changed his tone and the expression of his face for
      one of anger, if not downright violence, when he said:
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;You will! you have. You did yesterday. You do always. You have no
      decency; you make no secret of your temper; you have exposed yourself to
      Mr Chuzzlewit a hundred times.&rsquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Myself!&rsquo; cried Cherry, with a bitter smile. &lsquo;Oh indeed! I don&rsquo;t mind
      that.&rsquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Me, too, then,&rsquo; said Mr Pecksniff.
    </p>
    <p>
      His daughter answered with a scornful laugh.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;And since we have come to an explanation, Charity,&rsquo; said Mr Pecksniff,
      rolling his head portentously, &lsquo;let me tell you that I won&rsquo;t allow it.
      None of your nonsense, Miss! I won&rsquo;t permit it to be done.&rsquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;I shall do,&rsquo; said Charity, rocking her chair backwards and forwards, and
      raising her voice to a high pitch, &lsquo;I shall do, Pa, what I please and what
      I have done. I am not going to be crushed in everything, depend upon it.
      I&rsquo;ve been more shamefully used than anybody ever was in this world,&rsquo; here
      she began to cry and sob, &lsquo;and may expect the worse treatment from you, I
      know. But I don&rsquo;t care for that. No, I don&rsquo;t!&rsquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      Mr Pecksniff was made so desperate by the loud tone in which she spoke,
      that, after looking about him in frantic uncertainty for some means of
      softening it, he rose and shook her until the ornamental bow of hair upon
      her head nodded like a plume. She was so very much astonished by this
      assault, that it really had the desired effect.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;I&rsquo;ll do it again!&rsquo; cried Mr Pecksniff, as he resumed his seat and fetched
      his breath, &lsquo;if you dare to talk in that loud manner. How do you mean
      about being shamefully used? If Mr Jonas chose your sister in preference
      to you, who could help it, I should wish to know? What have I to do with
      it?&rsquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Wasn&rsquo;t I made a convenience of? Weren&rsquo;t my feelings trifled with? Didn&rsquo;t
      he address himself to me first?&rsquo; sobbed Cherry, clasping her hands; &lsquo;and
      oh, good gracious, that I should live to be shook!&rsquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;You&rsquo;ll live to be shaken again,&rsquo; returned her parent, &lsquo;if you drive me to
      that means of maintaining the decorum of this humble roof. You surprise
      me. I wonder you have not more spirit. If Mr Jonas didn&rsquo;t care for you,
      how could you wish to have him?&rsquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;I wish to have him!&rsquo; exclaimed Cherry. &lsquo;I wish to have him, Pa!&rsquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Then what are you making all this piece of work for,&rsquo; retorted her
      father, &lsquo;if you didn&rsquo;t wish to have him?&rsquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Because I was treated with duplicity,&rsquo; said Cherry; &lsquo;and because my own
      sister and my own father conspired against me. I am not angry with <i>her</i>,&rsquo;
      said Cherry; looking much more angry than ever. &lsquo;I pity her. I&rsquo;m sorry for
      her. I know the fate that&rsquo;s in store for her, with that Wretch.&rsquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Mr Jonas will survive your calling him a wretch, my child, I dare say,&rsquo;
      said Mr Pecksniff, with returning resignation; &lsquo;but call him what you like
      and make an end of it.&rsquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Not an end, Pa,&rsquo; said Charity. &lsquo;No, not an end. That&rsquo;s not the only point
      on which we&rsquo;re not agreed. I won&rsquo;t submit to it. It&rsquo;s better you should
      know that at once. No; I won&rsquo;t submit to it indeed, Pa! I am not quite a
      fool, and I am not blind. All I have got to say is, I won&rsquo;t submit to it.&rsquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      Whatever she meant, she shook Mr Pecksniff now; for his lame attempt to
      seem composed was melancholy in the last degree. His anger changed to
      meekness, and his words were mild and fawning.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;My dear,&rsquo; he said; &lsquo;if in the short excitement of an angry moment I
      resorted to an unjustifiable means of suppressing a little outbreak
      calculated to injure you as well as myself&mdash;it&rsquo;s possible I may have
      done so; perhaps I did&mdash;I ask your pardon. A father asking pardon of
      his child,&rsquo; said Mr Pecksniff, &lsquo;is, I believe, a spectacle to soften the
      most rugged nature.&rsquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      But it didn&rsquo;t at all soften Miss Pecksniff; perhaps because her nature was
      not rugged enough. On the contrary, she persisted in saying, over and over
      again, that she wasn&rsquo;t quite a fool, and wasn&rsquo;t blind, and wouldn&rsquo;t submit
      to it.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;You labour under some mistake, my child!&rsquo; said Mr Pecksniff, &lsquo;but I will
      not ask you what it is; I don&rsquo;t desire to know. No, pray!&rsquo; he added,
      holding out his hand and colouring again, &lsquo;let us avoid the subject, my
      dear, whatever it is!&rsquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;It&rsquo;s quite right that the subject should be avoided between us, sir,&rsquo;
      said Cherry. &lsquo;But I wish to be able to avoid it altogether, and
      consequently must beg you to provide me with a home.&rsquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      Mr Pecksniff looked about the room, and said, &lsquo;A home, my child!&rsquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Another home, papa,&rsquo; said Cherry, with increasing stateliness &lsquo;Place me
      at Mrs Todgers&rsquo;s or somewhere, on an independent footing; but I will not
      live here, if such is to be the case.&rsquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      It is possible that Miss Pecksniff saw in Mrs Todgers&rsquo;s a vision of
      enthusiastic men, pining to fall in adoration at her feet. It is possible
      that Mr Pecksniff, in his new-born juvenility, saw, in the suggestion of
      that same establishment, an easy means of relieving himself from an
      irksome charge in the way of temper and watchfulness. It is undoubtedly a
      fact that in the attentive ears of Mr Pecksniff, the proposition did not
      sound quite like the dismal knell of all his hopes.
    </p>
    <p>
      But he was a man of great feeling and acute sensibility; and he squeezed
      his pocket-handkerchief against his eyes with both hands&mdash;as such men
      always do, especially when they are observed. &lsquo;One of my birds,&rsquo; Mr
      Pecksniff said, &lsquo;has left me for the stranger&rsquo;s breast; the other would
      take wing to Todgers&rsquo;s! Well, well, what am I? I don&rsquo;t know what I am,
      exactly. Never mind!&rsquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      Even this remark, made more pathetic perhaps by his breaking down in the
      middle of it, had no effect upon Charity. She was grim, rigid, and
      inflexible.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;But I have ever,&rsquo; said Mr Pecksniff, &lsquo;sacrificed my children&rsquo;s happiness
      to my own&mdash;I mean my own happiness to my children&rsquo;s&mdash;and I will
      not begin to regulate my life by other rules of conduct now. If you can be
      happier at Mrs Todgers&rsquo;s than in your father&rsquo;s house, my dear, go to Mrs
      Todgers&rsquo;s! Do not think of me, my girl!&rsquo; said Mr Pecksniff with emotion;
      &lsquo;I shall get on pretty well, no doubt.&rsquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      Miss Charity, who knew he had a secret pleasure in the contemplation of
      the proposed change, suppressed her own, and went on to negotiate the
      terms. His views upon this subject were at first so very limited that
      another difference, involving possibly another shaking, threatened to
      ensue; but by degrees they came to something like an understanding, and
      the storm blew over. Indeed, Miss Charity&rsquo;s idea was so agreeable to both,
      that it would have been strange if they had not come to an amicable
      agreement. It was soon arranged between them that the project should be
      tried, and that immediately; and that Cherry&rsquo;s not being well, and needing
      change of scene, and wishing to be near her sister, should form the excuse
      for her departure to Mr Chuzzlewit and Mary, to both of whom she had
      pleaded indisposition for some time past. These premises agreed on, Mr
      Pecksniff gave her his blessing, with all the dignity of a self-denying
      man who had made a hard sacrifice, but comforted himself with the
      reflection that virtue is its own reward. Thus they were reconciled for
      the first time since that not easily forgiven night, when Mr Jonas,
      repudiating the elder, had confessed his passion for the younger sister,
      and Mr Pecksniff had abetted him on moral grounds.
    </p>
    <p>
      But how happened it&mdash;in the name of an unexpected addition to that
      small family, the Seven Wonders of the World, whatever and wherever they
      may be, how happened it&mdash;that Mr Pecksniff and his daughter were
      about to part? How happened it that their mutual relations were so greatly
      altered? Why was Miss Pecksniff so clamorous to have it understood that
      she was neither blind nor foolish, and she wouldn&rsquo;t bear it? It is not
      possible that Mr Pecksniff had any thoughts of marrying again; or that his
      daughter, with the sharp eye of a single woman, fathomed his design!
    </p>
    <p>
      Let us inquire into this.
    </p>
    <p>
      Mr Pecksniff, as a man without reproach, from whom the breath of slander
      passed like common breath from any other polished surface, could afford to
      do what common men could not. He knew the purity of his own motives; and
      when he had a motive worked at it as only a very good man (or a very bad
      one) can. Did he set before himself any strong and palpable motives for
      taking a second wife? Yes; and not one or two of them, but a combination
      of very many.
    </p>
    <p>
      Old Martin Chuzzlewit had gradually undergone an important change. Even
      upon the night when he made such an ill-timed arrival at Mr Pecksniff&rsquo;s
      house, he was comparatively subdued and easy to deal with. This Mr
      Pecksniff attributed, at the time, to the effect his brother&rsquo;s death had
      had upon him. But from that hour his character seemed to have modified by
      regular degrees, and to have softened down into a dull indifference for
      almost every one but Mr Pecksniff. His looks were much the same as ever,
      but his mind was singularly altered. It was not that this or that passion
      stood out in brighter or in dimmer hues; but that the colour of the whole
      man was faded. As one trait disappeared, no other trait sprung up to take
      its place. His senses dwindled too. He was less keen of sight; was deaf
      sometimes; took little notice of what passed before him; and would be
      profoundly taciturn for days together. The process of this alteration was
      so easy that almost as soon as it began to be observed it was complete.
      But Mr Pecksniff saw it first, and having Anthony Chuzzlewit fresh in his
      recollection, saw in his brother Martin the same process of decay.
    </p>
    <p>
      To a gentleman of Mr Pecksniff&rsquo;s tenderness, this was a very mournful
      sight. He could not but foresee the probability of his respected relative
      being made the victim of designing persons, and of his riches falling into
      worthless hands. It gave him so much pain that he resolved to secure the
      property to himself; to keep bad testamentary suitors at a distance; to
      wall up the old gentleman, as it were, for his own use. By little and
      little, therefore, he began to try whether Mr Chuzzlewit gave any promise
      of becoming an instrument in his hands, and finding that he did, and
      indeed that he was very supple in his plastic fingers, he made it the
      business of his life&mdash;kind soul!&mdash;to establish an ascendancy
      over him; and every little test he durst apply meeting with a success
      beyond his hopes, he began to think he heard old Martin&rsquo;s cash already
      chinking in his own unworldly pockets.
    </p>
    <p>
      But when Mr Pecksniff pondered on this subject (as, in his zealous way, he
      often did), and thought with an uplifted heart of the train of
      circumstances which had delivered the old gentleman into his hands for the
      confusion of evil-doers and the triumph of a righteous nature, he always
      felt that Mary Graham was his stumbling-block. Let the old man say what he
      would, Mr Pecksniff knew he had a strong affection for her. He knew that
      he showed it in a thousand little ways; that he liked to have her near
      him, and was never quite at ease when she was absent long. That he had
      ever really sworn to leave her nothing in his will, Mr Pecksniff greatly
      doubted. That even if he had, there were many ways by which he could evade
      the oath and satisfy his conscience, Mr Pecksniff knew. That her
      unprotected state was no light burden on the old man&rsquo;s mind, he also knew,
      for Mr Chuzzlewit had plainly told him so. &lsquo;Then,&rsquo; said Mr Pecksniff &lsquo;what
      if I married her! What,&rsquo; repeated Mr Pecksniff, sticking up his hair and
      glancing at his bust by Spoker; &lsquo;what if, making sure of his approval
      first&mdash;he is nearly imbecile, poor gentleman&mdash;I married her!&rsquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      Mr Pecksniff had a lively sense of the Beautiful; especially in women. His
      manner towards the sex was remarkable for its insinuating character. It is
      recorded of him in another part of these pages, that he embraced Mrs
      Todgers on the smallest provocation; and it was a way he had; it was a
      part of the gentle placidity of his disposition. Before any thought of
      matrimony was in his mind, he had bestowed on Mary many little tokens of
      his spiritual admiration. They had been indignantly received, but that was
      nothing. True, as the idea expanded within him, these had become too
      ardent to escape the piercing eye of Cherry, who read his scheme at once;
      but he had always felt the power of Mary&rsquo;s charms. So Interest and
      Inclination made a pair, and drew the curricle of Mr Pecksniff&rsquo;s plan.
    </p>
    <p>
      As to any thought of revenging himself on young Martin for his insolent
      expressions when they parted, and of shutting him out still more
      effectually from any hope of reconciliation with his grandfather, Mr
      Pecksniff was much too meek and forgiving to be suspected of harbouring
      it. As to being refused by Mary, Mr Pecksniff was quite satisfied that in
      her position she could never hold out if he and Mr Chuzzlewit were both
      against her. As to consulting the wishes of her heart in such a case, it
      formed no part of Mr Pecksniff&rsquo;s moral code; for he knew what a good man
      he was, and what a blessing he must be to anybody. His daughter having
      broken the ice, and the murder being out between them, Mr Pecksniff had
      now only to pursue his design as cleverly as he could, and by the
      craftiest approaches.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Well, my good sir,&rsquo; said Mr Pecksniff, meeting old Martin in the garden,
      for it was his habit to walk in and out by that way, as the fancy took
      him; &lsquo;and how is my dear friend this delicious morning?&rsquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Do you mean me?&rsquo; asked the old man.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Ah!&rsquo; said Mr Pecksniff, &lsquo;one of his deaf days, I see. Could I mean any
      one else, my dear sir?&rsquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;You might have meant Mary,&rsquo; said the old man.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Indeed I might. Quite true. I might speak of her as a dear, dear friend,
      I hope?&rsquo; observed Mr Pecksniff.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;I hope so,&rsquo; returned old Martin. &lsquo;I think she deserves it.&rsquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Think!&rsquo; cried Pecksniff, &lsquo;think, Mr Chuzzlewit!&rsquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;You are speaking, I know,&rsquo; returned Martin, &lsquo;but I don&rsquo;t catch what you
      say. Speak up!&rsquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;He&rsquo;s getting deafer than a flint,&rsquo; said Pecksniff. &lsquo;I was saying, my dear
      sir, that I am afraid I must make up my mind to part with Cherry.&rsquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;What has <i>she </i>been doing?&rsquo; asked the old man.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;He puts the most ridiculous questions I ever heard!&rsquo; muttered Mr
      Pecksniff. &lsquo;He&rsquo;s a child to-day.&rsquo; After which he added, in a mild roar:
      &lsquo;She hasn&rsquo;t been doing anything, my dear friend.&rsquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;What are you going to part with her for?&rsquo; demanded Martin.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;She hasn&rsquo;t her health by any means,&rsquo; said Mr Pecksniff. &lsquo;She misses her
      sister, my dear sir; they doted on each other from the cradle. And I think
      of giving her a run in London for a change. A good long run, sir, if I
      find she likes it.&rsquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Quite right,&rsquo; cried Martin. &lsquo;It&rsquo;s judicious.&rsquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;I am glad to hear you say so. I hope you mean to bear me company in this
      dull part, while she&rsquo;s away?&rsquo; said Mr Pecksniff.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;I have no intention of removing from it,&rsquo; was Martin&rsquo;s answer.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Then why,&rsquo; said Mr Pecksniff, taking the old man&rsquo;s arm in his, and
      walking slowly on; &lsquo;Why, my good sir, can&rsquo;t you come and stay with me? I
      am sure I could surround you with more comforts&mdash;lowly as is my Cot&mdash;than
      you can obtain at a village house of entertainment. And pardon me, Mr
      Chuzzlewit, pardon me if I say that such a place as the Dragon, however
      well-conducted (and, as far as I know, Mrs Lupin is one of the worthiest
      creatures in this county), is hardly a home for Miss Graham.&rsquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      Martin mused a moment; and then said, as he shook him by the hand:
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;No. You&rsquo;re quite right; it is not.&rsquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;The very sight of skittles,&rsquo; Mr Pecksniff eloquently pursued, &lsquo;is far
      from being congenial to a delicate mind.&rsquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;It&rsquo;s an amusement of the vulgar,&rsquo; said old Martin, &lsquo;certainly.&rsquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Of the very vulgar,&rsquo; Mr Pecksniff answered. &lsquo;Then why not bring Miss
      Graham here, sir? Here is the house. Here am I alone in it, for Thomas
      Pinch I do not count as any one. Our lovely friend shall occupy my
      daughter&rsquo;s chamber; you shall choose your own; we shall not quarrel, I
      hope!&rsquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;We are not likely to do that,&rsquo; said Martin.
    </p>
    <p>
      Mr Pecksniff pressed his hand. &lsquo;We understand each other, my dear sir, I
      see!&mdash;I can wind him,&rsquo; he thought, with exultation, &lsquo;round my little
      finger.&rsquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;You leave the recompense to me?&rsquo; said the old man, after a minute&rsquo;s
      silence.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Oh! do not speak of recompense!&rsquo; cried Pecksniff.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;I say,&rsquo; repeated Martin, with a glimmer of his old obstinacy, &lsquo;you leave
      the recompense to me. Do you?&rsquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Since you desire it, my good sir.&rsquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;I always desire it,&rsquo; said the old man. &lsquo;You know I always desire it. I
      wish to pay as I go, even when I buy of you. Not that I do not leave a
      balance to be settled one day, Pecksniff.&rsquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      The architect was too much overcome to speak. He tried to drop a tear upon
      his patron&rsquo;s hand, but couldn&rsquo;t find one in his dry distillery.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;May that day be very distant!&rsquo; was his pious exclamation. &lsquo;Ah, sir! If I
      could say how deep an interest I have in you and yours! I allude to our
      beautiful young friend.&rsquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;True,&rsquo; he answered. &lsquo;True. She need have some one interested in her. I
      did her wrong to train her as I did. Orphan though she was, she would have
      found some one to protect her whom she might have loved again. When she
      was a child, I pleased myself with the thought that in gratifying my whim
      of placing her between me and false-hearted knaves, I had done her a
      kindness. Now she is a woman, I have no such comfort. She has no protector
      but herself. I have put her at such odds with the world, that any dog may
      bark or fawn upon her at his pleasure. Indeed she stands in need of
      delicate consideration. Yes; indeed she does!&rsquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;If her position could be altered and defined, sir?&rsquo; Mr Pecksniff hinted.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;How can that be done? Should I make a seamstress of her, or a governess?&rsquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Heaven forbid!&rsquo; said Mr Pecksniff. &lsquo;My dear sir, there are other ways.
      There are indeed. But I am much excited and embarrassed at present, and
      would rather not pursue the subject. I scarcely know what I mean. Permit
      me to resume it at another time.&rsquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;You are not unwell?&rsquo; asked Martin anxiously.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;No, no!&rsquo; cried Pecksniff. &lsquo;No. Permit me to resume it at another time.
      I&rsquo;ll walk a little. Bless you!&rsquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      Old Martin blessed him in return, and squeezed his hand. As he turned
      away, and slowly walked towards the house, Mr Pecksniff stood gazing after
      him; being pretty well recovered from his late emotion, which, in any
      other man, one might have thought had been assumed as a machinery for
      feeling Martin&rsquo;s pulse. The change in the old man found such a slight
      expression in his figure, that Mr Pecksniff, looking after him, could not
      help saying to himself:
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;And I can wind him round my little finger! Only think!&rsquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      Old Martin happening to turn his head, saluted him affectionately. Mr
      Pecksniff returned the gesture.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Why, the time was,&rsquo; said Mr Pecksniff; &lsquo;and not long ago, when he
      wouldn&rsquo;t look at me! How soothing is this change. Such is the delicate
      texture of the human heart; so complicated is the process of its being
      softened! Externally he looks the same, and I can wind him round my little
      finger. Only think!&rsquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      In sober truth, there did appear to be nothing on which Mr Pecksniff might
      not have ventured with Martin Chuzzlewit; for whatever Mr Pecksniff said
      or did was right, and whatever he advised was done. Martin had escaped so
      many snares from needy fortune-hunters, and had withered in the shell of
      his suspicion and distrust for so many years, but to become the good man&rsquo;s
      tool and plaything. With the happiness of this conviction painted on his
      face, the architect went forth upon his morning walk.
    </p>
    <p>
      The summer weather in his bosom was reflected in the breast of Nature.
      Through deep green vistas where the boughs arched overhead, and showed the
      sunlight flashing in the beautiful perspective; through dewy fern from
      which the startled hares leaped up, and fled at his approach; by mantled
      pools, and fallen trees, and down in hollow places, rustling among last
      year&rsquo;s leaves whose scent woke memory of the past; the placid Pecksniff
      strolled. By meadow gates and hedges fragrant with wild roses; and by
      thatched-roof cottages whose inmates humbly bowed before him as a man both
      good and wise; the worthy Pecksniff walked in tranquil meditation. The bee
      passed onward, humming of the work he had to do; the idle gnats for ever
      going round and round in one contracting and expanding ring, yet always
      going on as fast as he, danced merrily before him; the colour of the long
      grass came and went, as if the light clouds made it timid as they floated
      through the distant air. The birds, so many Pecksniff consciences, sang
      gayly upon every branch; and Mr Pecksniff paid <i>his </i>homage to the day by
      ruminating on his projects as he walked along.
    </p>
    <p>
      Chancing to trip, in his abstraction, over the spreading root of an old
      tree, he raised his pious eyes to take a survey of the ground before him.
      It startled him to see the embodied image of his thoughts not far ahead.
      Mary herself. And alone.
    </p>
    <p>
      At first Mr Pecksniff stopped as if with the intention of avoiding her;
      but his next impulse was to advance, which he did at a brisk pace;
      caroling as he went so sweetly and with so much innocence that he only
      wanted feathers and wings to be a bird.
    </p>
    <p>
      Hearing notes behind her, not belonging to the songsters of the grove, she
      looked round. Mr Pecksniff kissed his hand, and was at her side
      immediately.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Communing with nature?&rsquo; said Mr Pecksniff. &lsquo;So am I.&rsquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      She said the morning was so beautiful that she had walked further than she
      intended, and would return. Mr Pecksniff said it was exactly his case, and
      he would return with her.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Take my arm, sweet girl,&rsquo; said Mr Pecksniff.
    </p>
    <p>
      Mary declined it, and walked so very fast that he remonstrated. &lsquo;You were
      loitering when I came upon you,&rsquo; Mr Pecksniff said. &lsquo;Why be so cruel as to
      hurry now? You would not shun me, would you?&rsquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Yes, I would,&rsquo; she answered, turning her glowing cheek indignantly upon
      him, &lsquo;you know I would. Release me, Mr Pecksniff. Your touch is
      disagreeable to me.&rsquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      His touch! What? That chaste patriarchal touch which Mrs Todgers&mdash;surely
      a discreet lady&mdash;had endured, not only without complaint, but with
      apparent satisfaction! This was positively wrong. Mr Pecksniff was sorry
      to hear her say it.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;If you have not observed,&rsquo; said Mary, &lsquo;that it is so, pray take assurance
      from my lips, and do not, as you are a gentleman, continue to offend me.&rsquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Well, well!&rsquo; said Mr Pecksniff, mildly, &lsquo;I feel that I might consider
      this becoming in a daughter of my own, and why should I object to it in
      one so beautiful! It&rsquo;s harsh. It cuts me to the soul,&rsquo; said Mr Pecksniff;
      &lsquo;but I cannot quarrel with you, Mary.&rsquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      She tried to say she was sorry to hear it, but burst into tears. Mr
      Pecksniff now repeated the Todgers performance on a comfortable scale, as
      if he intended it to last some time; and in his disengaged hand, catching
      hers, employed himself in separating the fingers with his own, and
      sometimes kissing them, as he pursued the conversation thus:
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;I am glad we met. I am very glad we met. I am able now to ease my bosom
      of a heavy load, and speak to you in confidence. Mary,&rsquo; said Mr Pecksniff
      in his tenderest tones, indeed they were so very tender that he almost
      squeaked: &lsquo;My soul! I love you!&rsquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      A fantastic thing, that maiden affectation! She made believe to shudder.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;I love you,&rsquo; said Mr Pecksniff, &lsquo;my gentle life, with a devotion which is
      quite surprising, even to myself. I did suppose that the sensation was
      buried in the silent tomb of a lady, only second to you in qualities of
      the mind and form; but I find I am mistaken.&rsquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      She tried to disengage her hand, but might as well have tried to free
      herself from the embrace of an affectionate boa-constrictor; if anything
      so wily may be brought into comparison with Pecksniff.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Although I am a widower,&rsquo; said Mr Pecksniff, examining the rings upon her
      fingers, and tracing the course of one delicate blue vein with his fat
      thumb, &lsquo;a widower with two daughters, still I am not encumbered, my love.
      One of them, as you know, is married. The other, by her own desire, but
      with a view, I will confess&mdash;why not?&mdash;to my altering my
      condition, is about to leave her father&rsquo;s house. I have a character, I
      hope. People are pleased to speak well of me, I think. My person and
      manner are not absolutely those of a monster, I trust. Ah! naughty Hand!&rsquo;
      said Mr Pecksniff, apostrophizing the reluctant prize, &lsquo;why did you take
      me prisoner? Go, go!&rsquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      He slapped the hand to punish it; but relenting, folded it in his
      waistcoat to comfort it again.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Blessed in each other, and in the society of our venerable friend, my
      darling,&rsquo; said Mr Pecksniff, &lsquo;we shall be happy. When he is wafted to a
      haven of rest, we will console each other. My pretty primrose, what do you
      say?&rsquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;It is possible,&rsquo; Mary answered, in a hurried manner, &lsquo;that I ought to
      feel grateful for this mark of your confidence. I cannot say that I do,
      but I am willing to suppose you may deserve my thanks. Take them; and pray
      leave me, Mr Pecksniff.&rsquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      The good man smiled a greasy smile; and drew her closer to him.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Pray, pray release me, Mr Pecksniff. I cannot listen to your proposal. I
      cannot receive it. There are many to whom it may be acceptable, but it is
      not so to me. As an act of kindness and an act of pity, leave me!&rsquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      Mr Pecksniff walked on with his arm round her waist, and her hand in his,
      as contentedly as if they had been all in all to each other, and were
      joined in the bonds of truest love.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;If you force me by your superior strength,&rsquo; said Mary, who finding that
      good words had not the least effect upon him, made no further effort to
      suppress her indignation; &lsquo;if you force me by your superior strength to
      accompany you back, and to be the subject of your insolence upon the way,
      you cannot constrain the expression of my thoughts. I hold you in the
      deepest abhorrence. I know your real nature and despise it.&rsquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;No, no,&rsquo; said Mr Pecksniff, sweetly. &lsquo;No, no, no!&rsquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;By what arts or unhappy chances you have gained your influence over Mr
      Chuzzlewit, I do not know,&rsquo; said Mary; &lsquo;it may be strong enough to soften
      even this, but he shall know of this, trust me, sir.&rsquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      Mr Pecksniff raised his heavy eyelids languidly, and let them fall again.
      It was saying with perfect coolness, &lsquo;Aye, aye! Indeed!&rsquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Is it not enough,&rsquo; said Mary, &lsquo;that you warp and change his nature, adapt
      his every prejudice to your bad ends, and harden a heart naturally kind by
      shutting out the truth and allowing none but false and distorted views to
      reach it; is it not enough that you have the power of doing this, and that
      you exercise it, but must you also be so coarse, so cruel, and so cowardly
      to me?&rsquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      Still Mr Pecksniff led her calmly on, and looked as mild as any lamb that
      ever pastured in the fields.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Will nothing move you, sir?&rsquo; cried Mary.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;My dear,&rsquo; observed Mr Pecksniff, with a placid leer, &lsquo;a habit of
      self-examination, and the practice of&mdash;shall I say of virtue?&rsquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Of hypocrisy,&rsquo; said Mary.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;No, no,&rsquo; resumed Mr Pecksniff, chafing the captive hand reproachfully,
      &lsquo;of virtue&mdash;have enabled me to set such guards upon myself, that it
      is really difficult to ruffle me. It is a curious fact, but it is
      difficult, do you know, for any one to ruffle me. And did she think,&rsquo; said
      Mr Pecksniff, with a playful tightening of his grasp &lsquo;that <i>she </i>could! How
      little did she know his heart!&rsquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      Little, indeed! Her mind was so strangely constituted that she would have
      preferred the caresses of a toad, an adder, or a serpent&mdash;nay, the
      hug of a bear&mdash;to the endearments of Mr Pecksniff.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Come, come,&rsquo; said that good gentleman, &lsquo;a word or two will set this
      matter right, and establish a pleasant understanding between us. I am not
      angry, my love.&rsquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;<i>You </i>angry!&rsquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;No,&rsquo; said Mr Pecksniff, &lsquo;I am not. I say so. Neither are you.&rsquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      There was a beating heart beneath his hand that told another story though.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;I am sure you are not,&rsquo; said Mr Pecksniff: &lsquo;and I will tell you why.
      There are two Martin Chuzzlewits, my dear; and your carrying your anger to
      one might have a serious effect&mdash;who knows!&mdash;upon the other. You
      wouldn&rsquo;t wish to hurt him, would you?&rsquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      She trembled violently, and looked at him with such a proud disdain that
      he turned his eyes away. No doubt lest he should be offended with her in
      spite of his better self.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;A passive quarrel, my love,&rsquo; said Mr Pecksniff, &lsquo;may be changed into an
      active one, remember. It would be sad to blight even a disinherited young
      man in his already blighted prospects; but how easy to do it. Ah, how
      easy! <i>Have </i>I influence with our venerable friend, do you think? Well,
      perhaps I have. Perhaps I have.&rsquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      He raised his eyes to hers; and nodded with an air of banter that was
      charming.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;No,&rsquo; he continued, thoughtfully. &lsquo;Upon the whole, my sweet, if I were you
      I&rsquo;d keep my secret to myself. I am not at all sure&mdash;very far from it&mdash;that
      it would surprise our friend in any way, for he and I have had some
      conversation together only this morning, and he is anxious, very anxious,
      to establish you in some more settled manner. But whether he was surprised
      or not surprised, the consequence of your imparting it might be the same.
      Martin junior might suffer severely. I&rsquo;d have compassion on Martin junior,
      do you know?&rsquo; said Mr Pecksniff, with a persuasive smile. &lsquo;Yes. He don&rsquo;t
      deserve it, but I would.&rsquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      She wept so bitterly now, and was so much distressed, that he thought it
      prudent to unclasp her waist, and hold her only by the hand.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;As to our own share in the precious little mystery,&rsquo; said Mr Pecksniff,
      &lsquo;we will keep it to ourselves, and talk of it between ourselves, and you
      shall think it over. You will consent, my love; you will consent, I know.
      Whatever you may think; you will. I seem to remember to have heard&mdash;I
      really don&rsquo;t know where, or how&rsquo;&mdash;he added, with bewitching
      frankness, &lsquo;that you and Martin junior, when you were children, had a sort
      of childish fondness for each other. When we are married, you shall have
      the satisfaction of thinking that it didn&rsquo;t last to ruin him, but passed
      away to do him good; for we&rsquo;ll see then what we can do to put some
      trifling help in Martin junior&rsquo;s way. <i>Have </i>I any influence with our
      venerable friend? Well! Perhaps I have. Perhaps I have.&rsquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      The outlet from the wood in which these tender passages occurred, was
      close to Mr Pecksniff&rsquo;s house. They were now so near it that he stopped,
      and holding up her little finger, said in playful accents, as a parting
      fancy:
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Shall I bite it?&rsquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      Receiving no reply he kissed it instead; and then stooping down, inclined
      his flabby face to hers&mdash;he had a flabby face, although he <i>was </i>a good
      man&mdash;and with a blessing, which from such a source was quite enough
      to set her up in life, and prosper her from that time forth permitted her
      to leave him.
    </p>
    <p>
      Gallantry in its true sense is supposed to ennoble and dignify a man; and
      love has shed refinements on innumerable Cymons. But Mr Pecksniff&mdash;perhaps
      because to one of his exalted nature these were mere grossnesses&mdash;certainly
      did not appear to any unusual advantage, now that he was left alone. On
      the contrary, he seemed to be shrunk and reduced; to be trying to hide
      himself within himself; and to be wretched at not having the power to do
      it. His shoes looked too large; his sleeve looked too long; his hair
      looked too limp; his features looked too mean; his exposed throat looked
      as if a halter would have done it good. For a minute or two, in fact, he
      was hot, and pale, and mean, and shy, and slinking, and consequently not
      at all Pecksniffian. But after that, he recovered himself, and went home
      with as beneficent an air as if he had been the High Priest of the summer
      weather.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;I have arranged to go, Papa,&rsquo; said Charity, &lsquo;to-morrow.&rsquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;So soon, my child!&rsquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;I can&rsquo;t go too soon,&rsquo; said Charity, &lsquo;under the circumstances. I have
      written to Mrs Todgers to propose an arrangement, and have requested her
      to meet me at the coach, at all events. You&rsquo;ll be quite your own master
      now, Mr Pinch!&rsquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      Mr Pecksniff had just gone out of the room, and Tom had just come into it.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;My own master!&rsquo; repeated Tom.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Yes, you&rsquo;ll have nobody to interfere with you,&rsquo; said Charity. &lsquo;At least I
      hope you won&rsquo;t. Hem! It&rsquo;s a changing world.&rsquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;What! are <i>you </i>going to be married, Miss Pecksniff?&rsquo; asked Tom in great
      surprise.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Not exactly,&rsquo; faltered Cherry. &lsquo;I haven&rsquo;t made up my mind to be. I
      believe I could be, if I chose, Mr Pinch.&rsquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Of course you could!&rsquo; said Tom. And he said it in perfect good faith. He
      believed it from the bottom of his heart.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;No,&rsquo; said Cherry, &lsquo;I am not going to be married. Nobody is, that I know
      of. Hem! But I am not going to live with Papa. I have my reasons, but it&rsquo;s
      all a secret. I shall always feel very kindly towards you, I assure you,
      for the boldness you showed that night. As to you and me, Mr Pinch, <i>we</i>
      part the best friends possible!&rsquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      Tom thanked her for her confidence, and for her friendship, but there was
      a mystery in the former which perfectly bewildered him. In his extravagant
      devotion to the family, he had felt the loss of Merry more than any one
      but those who knew that for all the slights he underwent he thought his
      own demerits were to blame, could possibly have understood. He had
      scarcely reconciled himself to that when here was Charity about to leave
      them. She had grown up, as it were, under Tom&rsquo;s eye. The sisters were a
      part of Pecksniff, and a part of Tom; items in Pecksniff&rsquo;s goodness, and
      in Tom&rsquo;s service. He couldn&rsquo;t bear it; not two hours&rsquo; sleep had Tom that
      night, through dwelling in his bed upon these dreadful changes.
    </p>
    <p>
      When morning dawned he thought he must have dreamed this piece of
      ambiguity; but no, on going downstairs he found them packing trunks and
      cording boxes, and making other preparations for Miss Charity&rsquo;s departure,
      which lasted all day long. In good time for the evening coach, Miss
      Charity deposited her housekeeping keys with much ceremony upon the
      parlour table; took a gracious leave of all the house; and quitted her
      paternal roof&mdash;a blessing for which the Pecksniffian servant was
      observed by some profane persons to be particularly active in the
      thanksgiving at church next Sunday.

    <h2>
      CHAPTER THIRTY-ONE
    </h2>
    <p>
      MR PINCH IS DISCHARGED OF A DUTY WHICH HE NEVER OWED TO ANYBODY, AND MR
      PECKSNIFF DISCHARGES A DUTY WHICH HE OWES TO SOCIETY
    </p>
    <p>
      The closing words of the last chapter lead naturally to the commencement
      of this, its successor; for it has to do with a church. With the church,
      so often mentioned heretofore, in which Tom Pinch played the organ for
      nothing.
    </p>
    <p>
      One sultry afternoon, about a week after Miss Charity&rsquo;s departure for
      London, Mr Pecksniff being out walking by himself, took it into his head
      to stray into the churchyard. As he was lingering among the tombstones,
      endeavouring to extract an available sentiment or two from the epitaphs&mdash;for
      he never lost an opportunity of making up a few moral crackers, to be let
      off as occasion served&mdash;Tom Pinch began to practice. Tom could run
      down to the church and do so whenever he had time to spare; for it was a
      simple little organ, provided with wind by the action of the musician&rsquo;s
      feet; and he was independent, even of a bellows-blower. Though if Tom had
      wanted one at any time, there was not a man or boy in all the village, and
      away to the turnpike (tollman included), but would have blown away for him
      till he was black in the face.
    </p>
    <p>
      Mr Pecksniff had no objection to music; not the least. He was tolerant of
      everything; he often said so. He considered it a vagabond kind of
      trifling, in general, just suited to Tom&rsquo;s capacity. But in regard to
      Tom&rsquo;s performance upon this same organ, he was remarkably lenient,
      singularly amiable; for when Tom played it on Sundays, Mr Pecksniff in his
      unbounded sympathy felt as if he played it himself, and were a benefactor
      to the congregation. So whenever it was impossible to devise any other
      means of taking the value of Tom&rsquo;s wages out of him, Mr Pecksniff gave him
      leave to cultivate this instrument. For which mark of his consideration
      Tom was very grateful.
    </p>
    <p>
      The afternoon was remarkably warm, and Mr Pecksniff had been strolling a
      long way. He had not what may be called a fine ear for music, but he knew
      when it had a tranquilizing influence on his soul; and that was the case
      now, for it sounded to him like a melodious snore. He approached the
      church, and looking through the diamond lattice of a window near the
      porch, saw Tom, with the curtains in the loft drawn back, playing away
      with great expression and tenderness.
    </p>
    <p>
      The church had an inviting air of coolness. The old oak roof supported by
      cross-beams, the hoary walls, the marble tablets, and the cracked stone
      pavement, were refreshing to look at. There were leaves of ivy tapping
      gently at the opposite windows; and the sun poured in through only one;
      leaving the body of the church in tempting shade. But the most tempting
      spot of all, was one red-curtained and soft-cushioned pew, wherein the
      official dignitaries of the place (of whom Mr Pecksniff was the head and
      chief) enshrined themselves on Sundays. Mr Pecksniff&rsquo;s seat was in the
      corner; a remarkably comfortable corner; where his very large Prayer-Book
      was at that minute making the most of its quarto self upon the desk. He
      determined to go in and rest.
    </p>
    <p>
      He entered very softly; in part because it was a church; in part because
      his tread was always soft; in part because Tom played a solemn tune; in
      part because he thought he would surprise him when he stopped. Unbolting
      the door of the high pew of state, he glided in and shut it after him;
      then sitting in his usual place, and stretching out his legs upon the
      hassocks, he composed himself to listen to the music.
    </p>
    <p>
      It is an unaccountable circumstance that he should have felt drowsy there,
      where the force of association might surely have been enough to keep him
      wide awake; but he did. He had not been in the snug little corner five
      minutes before he began to nod. He had not recovered himself one minute
      before he began to nod again. In the very act of opening his eyes
      indolently, he nodded again. In the very act of shutting them, he nodded
      again. So he fell out of one nod into another until at last he ceased to
      nod at all, and was as fast as the church itself.
    </p>
    <p>
      He had a consciousness of the organ, long after he fell asleep, though as
      to its being an organ he had no more idea of that than he had of its being
      a bull. After a while he began to have at intervals the same dreamy
      impressions of voices; and awakening to an indolent curiosity upon the
      subject, opened his eyes.
    </p>
    <p>
      He was so indolent, that after glancing at the hassocks and the pew, he
      was already half-way off to sleep again, when it occurred to him that
      there really were voices in the church; low voices, talking earnestly hard
      by; while the echoes seemed to mutter responses. He roused himself, and
      listened.
    </p>
    <p>
      Before he had listened half a dozen seconds, he became as broad awake as
      ever he had been in all his life. With eyes, and ears, and mouth, wide
      open, he moved himself a very little with the utmost caution, and
      gathering the curtain in his hand, peeped out.
    </p>
    <p>
      Tom Pinch and Mary. Of course. He had recognized their voices, and already
      knew the topic they discussed. Looking like the small end of a guillotined
      man, with his chin on a level with the top of the pew, so that he might
      duck down immediately in case of either of them turning round, he
      listened. Listened with such concentrated eagerness, that his very hair
      and shirt-collar stood bristling up to help him.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;No,&rsquo; cried Tom. &lsquo;No letters have ever reached me, except that one from
      New York. But don&rsquo;t be uneasy on that account, for it&rsquo;s very likely they
      have gone away to some far-off place, where the posts are neither regular
      nor frequent. He said in that very letter that it might be so, even in
      that city to which they thought of travelling&mdash;Eden, you know.&rsquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;It is a great weight upon my mind,&rsquo; said Mary.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Oh, but you mustn&rsquo;t let it be,&rsquo; said Tom. &lsquo;There&rsquo;s a true saying that
      nothing travels so fast as ill news; and if the slightest harm had
      happened to Martin, you may be sure you would have heard of it long ago. I
      have often wished to say this to you,&rsquo; Tom continued with an embarrassment
      that became him very well, &lsquo;but you have never given me an opportunity.&rsquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;I have sometimes been almost afraid,&rsquo; said Mary, &lsquo;that you might suppose
      I hesitated to confide in you, Mr Pinch.&rsquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;No,&rsquo; Tom stammered, &lsquo;I&mdash;I am not aware that I ever supposed that. I
      am sure that if I have, I have checked the thought directly, as an
      injustice to you. I feel the delicacy of your situation in having to
      confide in me at all,&rsquo; said Tom, &lsquo;but I would risk my life to save you
      from one day&rsquo;s uneasiness; indeed I would!&rsquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      Poor Tom!
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;I have dreaded sometimes,&rsquo; Tom continued, &lsquo;that I might have displeased
      you by&mdash;by having the boldness to try and anticipate your wishes now
      and then. At other times I have fancied that your kindness prompted you to
      keep aloof from me.&rsquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Indeed!&rsquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;It was very foolish; very presumptuous and ridiculous, to think so,&rsquo; Tom
      pursued; &lsquo;but I feared you might suppose it possible that I&mdash;I&mdash;should
      admire you too much for my own peace; and so denied yourself the slight
      assistance you would otherwise have accepted from me. If such an idea has
      ever presented itself to you,&rsquo; faltered Tom, &lsquo;pray dismiss it. I am easily
      made happy; and I shall live contented here long after you and Martin have
      forgotten me. I am a poor, shy, awkward creature; not at all a man of the
      world; and you should think no more of me, bless you, than if I were an
      old friar!&rsquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      If friars bear such hearts as thine, Tom, let friars multiply; though they
      have no such rule in all their stern arithmetic.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Dear Mr Pinch!&rsquo; said Mary, giving him her hand; &lsquo;I cannot tell you how
      your kindness moves me. I have never wronged you by the lightest doubt,
      and have never for an instant ceased to feel that you were all&mdash;much
      more than all&mdash;that Martin found you. Without the silent care and
      friendship I have experienced from you, my life here would have been
      unhappy. But you have been a good angel to me; filling me with gratitude
      of heart, hope, and courage.&rsquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;I am as little like an angel, I am afraid,&rsquo; replied Tom, shaking his
      head, &lsquo;as any stone cherubim among the grave-stones; and I don&rsquo;t think
      there are many real angels of <i>that </i>pattern. But I should like to know (if
      you will tell me) why you have been so very silent about Martin.&rsquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Because I have been afraid,&rsquo; said Mary, &lsquo;of injuring you.&rsquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Of injuring me!&rsquo; cried Tom.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Of doing you an injury with your employer.&rsquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      The gentleman in question dived.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;With Pecksniff!&rsquo; rejoined Tom, with cheerful confidence. &lsquo;Oh dear, he&rsquo;d
      never think of us! He&rsquo;s the best of men. The more at ease you were, the
      happier he would be. Oh dear, you needn&rsquo;t be afraid of Pecksniff. He is
      not a spy.&rsquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      Many a man in Mr Pecksniff&rsquo;s place, if he could have dived through the
      floor of the pew of state and come out at Calcutta or any inhabited region
      on the other side of the earth, would have done it instantly. Mr Pecksniff
      sat down upon a hassock, and listening more attentively than ever, smiled.
    </p>
    <p>
      Mary seemed to have expressed some dissent in the meanwhile, for Tom went
      on to say, with honest energy:
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Well, I don&rsquo;t know how it is, but it always happens, whenever I express
      myself in this way to anybody almost, that I find they won&rsquo;t do justice to
      Pecksniff. It is one of the most extraordinary circumstances that ever
      came within my knowledge, but it is so. There&rsquo;s John Westlock, who used to
      be a pupil here, one of the best-hearted young men in the world, in all
      other matters&mdash;I really believe John would have Pecksniff flogged at
      the cart&rsquo;s tail if he could. And John is not a solitary case, for every
      pupil we have had in my time has gone away with the same inveterate hatred
      of him. There was Mark Tapley, too, quite in another station of life,&rsquo;
      said Tom; &lsquo;the mockery he used to make of Pecksniff when he was at the
      Dragon was shocking. Martin too: Martin was worse than any of &lsquo;em. But I
      forgot. He prepared you to dislike Pecksniff, of course. So you came with
      a prejudice, you know, Miss Graham, and are not a fair witness.&rsquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      Tom triumphed very much in this discovery, and rubbed his hands with great
      satisfaction.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Mr Pinch,&rsquo; said Mary, &lsquo;you mistake him.&rsquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;No, no!&rsquo; cried Tom. &lsquo;<i>You </i>mistake him. But,&rsquo; he added, with a rapid change
      in his tone, &lsquo;what is the matter? Miss Graham, what is the matter?&rsquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      Mr Pecksniff brought up to the top of the pew, by slow degrees, his hair,
      his forehead, his eyebrow, his eye. She was sitting on a bench beside the
      door with her hands before her face; and Tom was bending over her.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;What is the matter?&rsquo; cried Tom. &lsquo;Have I said anything to hurt you? Has
      any one said anything to hurt you? Don&rsquo;t cry. Pray tell me what it is. I
      cannot bear to see you so distressed. Mercy on us, I never was so
      surprised and grieved in all my life!&rsquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      Mr Pecksniff kept his eye in the same place. He could have moved it now
      for nothing short of a gimlet or a red-hot wire.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;I wouldn&rsquo;t have told you, Mr Pinch,&rsquo; said Mary, &lsquo;if I could have helped
      it; but your delusion is so absorbing, and it is so necessary that we
      should be upon our guard; that you should not be compromised; and to that
      end that you should know by whom I am beset; that no alternative is left
      me. I came here purposely to tell you, but I think I should have wanted
      courage if you had not chanced to lead me so directly to the object of my
      coming.&rsquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      Tom gazed at her steadfastly, and seemed to say, &lsquo;What else?&rsquo; But he said
      not a word.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;That person whom you think the best of men,&rsquo; said Mary, looking up, and
      speaking with a quivering lip and flashing eye.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Lord bless me!&rsquo; muttered Tom, staggering back. &lsquo;Wait a moment. That
      person whom I think the best of men! You mean Pecksniff, of course. Yes, I
      see you mean Pecksniff. Good gracious me, don&rsquo;t speak without authority.
      What has he done? If he is not the best of men, what is he?&rsquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;The worst. The falsest, craftiest, meanest, cruellest, most sordid, most
      shameless,&rsquo; said the trembling girl&mdash;trembling with her indignation.
    </p>
    <p>
      Tom sat down on a seat, and clasped his hands.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;What is he,&rsquo; said Mary, &lsquo;who receiving me in his house as his guest; his
      unwilling guest; knowing my history, and how defenceless and alone I am,
      presumes before his daughters to affront me so, that if I had a brother
      but a child, who saw it, he would instinctively have helped me?&rsquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;He is a scoundrel!&rsquo; exclaimed Tom. &lsquo;Whoever he may be, he is a
      scoundrel.&rsquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      Mr Pecksniff dived again.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;What is he,&rsquo; said Mary, &lsquo;who, when my only friend&mdash;a dear and kind
      one, too&mdash;was in full health of mind, humbled himself before him, but
      was spurned away (for he knew him then) like a dog. Who, in his forgiving
      spirit, now that that friend is sunk into a failing state, can crawl about
      him again, and use the influence he basely gains for every base and wicked
      purpose, and not for one&mdash;not one&mdash;that&rsquo;s true or good?&rsquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;I say he is a scoundrel!&rsquo; answered Tom.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;But what is he&mdash;oh, Mr Pinch, what <i>is</i> he&mdash;who, thinking he
      could compass these designs the better if I were his wife, assails me with
      the coward&rsquo;s argument that if I marry him, Martin, on whom I have brought
      so much misfortune, shall be restored to something of his former hopes;
      and if I do not, shall be plunged in deeper ruin? What is he who makes my
      very constancy to one I love with all my heart a torture to myself and
      wrong to him; who makes me, do what I will, the instrument to hurt a head
      I would heap blessings on! What is he who, winding all these cruel snares
      about me, explains their purpose to me, with a smooth tongue and a smiling
      face, in the broad light of day; dragging me on, the while, in his
      embrace, and holding to his lips a hand,&rsquo; pursued the agitated girl,
      extending it, &lsquo;which I would have struck off, if with it I could lose the
      shame and degradation of his touch?&rsquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;I say,&rsquo; cried Tom, in great excitement, &lsquo;he is a scoundrel and a villain!
      I don&rsquo;t care who he is, I say he is a double-dyed and most intolerable
      villain!&rsquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      Covering her face with her hands again, as if the passion which had
      sustained her through these disclosures lost itself in an overwhelming
      sense of shame and grief, she abandoned herself to tears.
    </p>
    <p>
      Any sight of distress was sure to move the tenderness of Tom, but this
      especially. Tears and sobs from her were arrows in his heart. He tried to
      comfort her; sat down beside her; expended all his store of homely
      eloquence; and spoke in words of praise and hope of Martin. Aye, though he
      loved her from his soul with such a self-denying love as woman seldom
      wins; he spoke from first to last of Martin. Not the wealth of the rich
      Indies would have tempted Tom to shirk one mention of her lover&rsquo;s name.
    </p>
    <p>
      When she was more composed, she impressed upon Tom that this man she had
      described, was Pecksniff in his real colours; and word by word and phrase
      by phrase, as well as she remembered it, related what had passed between
      them in the wood: which was no doubt a source of high gratification to
      that gentleman himself, who in his desire to see and his dread of being
      seen, was constantly diving down into the state pew, and coming up again
      like the intelligent householder in Punch&rsquo;s Show, who avoids being knocked
      on the head with a cudgel. When she had concluded her account, and had
      besought Tom to be very distant and unconscious in his manner towards her
      after this explanation, and had thanked him very much, they parted on the
      alarm of footsteps in the burial-ground; and Tom was left alone in the
      church again.
    </p>
    <p>
      And now the full agitation and misery of the disclosure came rushing upon
      Tom indeed. The star of his whole life from boyhood had become, in a
      moment, putrid vapour. It was not that Pecksniff, Tom&rsquo;s Pecksniff, had
      ceased to exist, but that he never had existed. In his death Tom would
      have had the comfort of remembering what he used to be, but in this
      discovery, he had the anguish of recollecting what he never was. For, as
      Tom&rsquo;s blindness in this matter had been total and not partial, so was his
      restored sight. <i>His </i>Pecksniff could never have worked the wickedness of
      which he had just now heard, but any other Pecksniff could; and the
      Pecksniff who could do that could do anything, and no doubt had been doing
      anything and everything except the right thing, all through his career.
      From the lofty height on which poor Tom had placed his idol it was tumbled
      down headlong, and
    </p>
<pre xml:space="preserve">
     Not all the king&rsquo;s horses, nor all the king&rsquo;s men,
     Could have set Mr Pecksniff up again.
</pre>
    <p>
      Legions of Titans couldn&rsquo;t have got him out of the mud; and serve him
      right! But it was not he who suffered; it was Tom. His compass was broken,
      his chart destroyed, his chronometer had stopped, his masts were gone by
      the board; his anchor was adrift, ten thousand leagues away.
    </p>
    <p>
      Mr Pecksniff watched him with a lively interest, for he divined the
      purpose of Tom&rsquo;s ruminations, and was curious to see how he conducted
      himself. For some time, Tom wandered up and down the aisle like a man
      demented, stopping occasionally to lean against a pew and think it over;
      then he stood staring at a blank old monument bordered tastefully with
      skulls and cross-bones, as if it were the finest work of Art he had ever
      seen, although at other times he held it in unspeakable contempt; then he
      sat down; then walked to and fro again; then went wandering up into the
      organ-loft, and touched the keys. But their minstrelsy was changed, their
      music gone; and sounding one long melancholy chord, Tom drooped his head
      upon his hands and gave it up as hopeless.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;I wouldn&rsquo;t have cared,&rsquo; said Tom Pinch, rising from his stool and looking
      down into the church as if he had been the Clergyman, &lsquo;I wouldn&rsquo;t have
      cared for anything he might have done to Me, for I have tried his patience
      often, and have lived upon his sufferance and have never been the help to
      him that others could have been. I wouldn&rsquo;t have minded, Pecksniff,&rsquo; Tom
      continued, little thinking who heard him, &lsquo;if you had done Me any wrong; I
      could have found plenty of excuses for that; and though you might have
      hurt me, could have still gone on respecting you. But why did you ever
      fall so low as this in my esteem! Oh Pecksniff, Pecksniff, there is
      nothing I would not have given, to have had you deserve my old opinion of
      you; nothing!&rsquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      Mr Pecksniff sat upon the hassock pulling up his shirt-collar, while Tom,
      touched to the quick, delivered this apostrophe. After a pause he heard
      Tom coming down the stairs, jingling the church keys; and bringing his eye
      to the top of the pew again, saw him go slowly out and lock the door.
    </p>
    <p>
      Mr Pecksniff durst not issue from his place of concealment; for through
      the windows of the church he saw Tom passing on among the graves, and
      sometimes stopping at a stone, and leaning there as if he were a mourner
      who had lost a friend. Even when he had left the churchyard, Mr Pecksniff
      still remained shut up; not being at all secure but that in his restless
      state of mind Tom might come wandering back. At length he issued forth,
      and walked with a pleasant countenance into the vestry; where he knew
      there was a window near the ground, by which he could release himself by
      merely stepping out.
    </p>
    <p>
      He was in a curious frame of mind, Mr Pecksniff; being in no hurry to go,
      but rather inclining to a dilatory trifling with the time, which prompted
      him to open the vestry cupboard, and look at himself in the parson&rsquo;s
      little glass that hung within the door. Seeing that his hair was rumpled,
      he took the liberty of borrowing the canonical brush and arranging it. He
      also took the liberty of opening another cupboard; but he shut it up again
      quickly, being rather startled by the sight of a black and a white
      surplice dangling against the wall; which had very much the appearance of
      two curates who had committed suicide by hanging themselves. Remembering
      that he had seen in the first cupboard a port-wine bottle and some
      biscuits, he peeped into it again, and helped himself with much
      deliberation; cogitating all the time though, in a very deep and weighty
      manner, as if his thoughts were otherwise employed.
    </p>
    <p>
      He soon made up his mind, if it had ever been in doubt; and putting back
      the bottle and biscuits, opened the casement. He got out into the
      churchyard without any difficulty; shut the window after him; and walked
      straight home.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Is Mr Pinch indoors?&rsquo; asked Mr Pecksniff of his serving-maid.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Just come in, sir.&rsquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Just come in, eh?&rsquo; repeated Mr Pecksniff, cheerfully. &lsquo;And gone upstairs,
      I suppose?&rsquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Yes sir. Gone upstairs. Shall I call him, sir?&rsquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;No,&rsquo; said Mr Pecksniff, &lsquo;no. You needn&rsquo;t call him, Jane. Thank you, Jane.
      How are your relations, Jane?&rsquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Pretty well, I thank you, sir.&rsquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;I am glad to hear it. Let them know I asked about them, Jane. Is Mr
      Chuzzlewit in the way, Jane?&rsquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Yes, sir. He&rsquo;s in the parlour, reading.&rsquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;He&rsquo;s in the parlour, reading, is he, Jane?&rsquo; said Mr Pecksniff. &lsquo;Very
      well. Then I think I&rsquo;ll go and see him, Jane.&rsquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      Never had Mr Pecksniff been beheld in a more pleasant humour!
    </p>
    <p>
      But when he walked into the parlour where the old man was engaged as Jane
      had said; with pen and ink and paper on a table close at hand (for Mr
      Pecksniff was always very particular to have him well supplied with
      writing materials), he became less cheerful. He was not angry, he was not
      vindictive, he was not cross, he was not moody, but he was grieved; he was
      sorely grieved. As he sat down by the old man&rsquo;s side, two tears&mdash;not
      tears like those with which recording angels blot their entries out, but
      drops so precious that they use them for their ink&mdash;stole down his
      meritorious cheeks.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;What is the matter?&rsquo; asked old Martin. &lsquo;Pecksniff, what ails you, man?&rsquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;I am sorry to interrupt you, my dear sir, and I am still more sorry for
      the cause. My good, my worthy friend, I am deceived.&rsquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;You are deceived!&rsquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Ah!&rsquo; cried Mr Pecksniff, in an agony, &lsquo;deceived in the tenderest point.
      Cruelly deceived in that quarter, sir, in which I placed the most
      unbounded confidence. Deceived, Mr Chuzzlewit, by Thomas Pinch.&rsquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Oh! bad, bad, bad!&rsquo; said Martin, laying down his book. &lsquo;Very bad! I hope
      not. Are you certain?&rsquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Certain, my good sir! My eyes and ears are witnesses. I wouldn&rsquo;t have
      believed it otherwise. I wouldn&rsquo;t have believed it, Mr Chuzzlewit, if a
      Fiery Serpent had proclaimed it from the top of Salisbury Cathedral. I
      would have said,&rsquo; cried Mr Pecksniff, &lsquo;that the Serpent lied. Such was my
      faith in Thomas Pinch, that I would have cast the falsehood back into the
      Serpent&rsquo;s teeth, and would have taken Thomas to my heart. But I am not a
      Serpent, sir, myself, I grieve to say, and no excuse or hope is left me.&rsquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      Martin was greatly disturbed to see him so much agitated, and to hear such
      unexpected news. He begged him to compose himself, and asked upon what
      subject Mr Pinch&rsquo;s treachery had been developed.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;That is almost the worst of all, sir,&rsquo; Mr Pecksniff answered, &lsquo;on a
      subject nearly concerning <i>you</i>. Oh! is it not enough,&rsquo; said Mr Pecksniff,
      looking upward, &lsquo;that these blows must fall on me, but must they also hit
      my friends!&rsquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;You alarm me,&rsquo; cried the old man, changing colour. &lsquo;I am not so strong as
      I was. You terrify me, Pecksniff!&rsquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Cheer up, my noble sir,&rsquo; said Mr Pecksniff, taking courage, &lsquo;and we will
      do what is required of us. You shall know all, sir, and shall be righted.
      But first excuse me, sir, excuse me. I have a duty to discharge, which I
      owe to society.&rsquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      He rang the bell, and Jane appeared. &lsquo;Send Mr Pinch here, if you please,
      Jane.&rsquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      Tom came. Constrained and altered in his manner, downcast and dejected,
      visibly confused; not liking to look Pecksniff in the face.
    </p>
    <p>
      The honest man bestowed a glance on Mr Chuzzlewit, as who should say &lsquo;You
      see!&rsquo; and addressed himself to Tom in these terms:
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Mr Pinch, I have left the vestry-window unfastened. Will you do me the
      favour to go and secure it; then bring the keys of the sacred edifice to
      me!&rsquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;The vestry-window, sir?&rsquo; cried Tom.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;You understand me, Mr Pinch, I think,&rsquo; returned his patron. &lsquo;Yes, Mr
      Pinch, the vestry-window. I grieve to say that sleeping in the church
      after a fatiguing ramble, I overheard just now some fragments,&rsquo; he
      emphasised that word, &lsquo;of a dialogue between two parties; and one of them
      locking the church when he went out, I was obliged to leave it myself by
      the vestry-window. Do me the favour to secure that vestry-window, Mr
      Pinch, and then come back to me.&rsquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      No physiognomist that ever dwelt on earth could have construed Tom&rsquo;s face
      when he heard these words. Wonder was in it, and a mild look of reproach,
      but certainly no fear or guilt, although a host of strong emotions
      struggled to display themselves. He bowed, and without saying one word,
      good or bad, withdrew.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Pecksniff,&rsquo; cried Martin, in a tremble, &lsquo;what does all this mean? You are
      not going to do anything in haste, you may regret!&rsquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;No, my good sir,&rsquo; said Mr Pecksniff, firmly, &lsquo;No. But I have a duty to
      discharge which I owe to society; and it shall be discharged, my friend,
      at any cost!&rsquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      Oh, late-remembered, much-forgotten, mouthing, braggart duty, always owed,
      and seldom paid in any other coin than punishment and wrath, when will
      mankind begin to know thee! When will men acknowledge thee in thy
      neglected cradle, and thy stunted youth, and not begin their recognition
      in thy sinful manhood and thy desolate old age! Oh, ermined Judge whose
      duty to society is, now, to doom the ragged criminal to punishment and
      death, hadst thou never, Man, a duty to discharge in barring up the
      hundred open gates that wooed him to the felon&rsquo;s dock, and throwing but
      ajar the portals to a decent life! Oh, prelate, prelate, whose duty to
      society it is to mourn in melancholy phrase the sad degeneracy of these
      bad times in which thy lot of honours has been cast, did nothing go before
      thy elevation to the lofty seat, from which thou dealest out thy homilies
      to other tarriers for dead men&rsquo;s shoes, whose duty to society has not
      begun! Oh! magistrate, so rare a country gentleman and brave a squire, had
      you no duty to society, before the ricks were blazing and the mob were
      mad; or did it spring up, armed and booted from the earth, a corps of
      yeomanry full-grown!
    </p>
    <p>
      Mr Pecksniff&rsquo;s duty to society could not be paid till Tom came back. The
      interval which preceded the return of that young man, he occupied in a
      close conference with his friend; so that when Tom did arrive, he found
      the two quite ready to receive him. Mary was in her own room above,
      whither Mr Pecksniff, always considerate, had besought old Martin to
      entreat her to remain some half-hour longer, that her feelings might be
      spared.
    </p>
    <p>
      When Tom came back, he found old Martin sitting by the window, and Mr
      Pecksniff in an imposing attitude at the table. On one side of him was his
      pocket-handkerchief; and on the other a little heap (a very little heap)
      of gold and silver, and odd pence. Tom saw, at a glance, that it was his
      own salary for the current quarter.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Have you fastened the vestry-window, Mr Pinch?&rsquo; said Pecksniff.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Yes, sir.&rsquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Thank you. Put down the keys if you please, Mr Pinch.&rsquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      Tom placed them on the table. He held the bunch by the key of the
      organ-loft (though it was one of the smallest), and looked hard at it as
      he laid it down. It had been an old, old friend of Tom&rsquo;s; a kind companion
      to him, many and many a day.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Mr Pinch,&rsquo; said Pecksniff, shaking his head; &lsquo;oh, Mr Pinch! I wonder you
      can look me in the face!&rsquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      Tom did it though; and notwithstanding that he has been described as
      stooping generally, he stood as upright then as man could stand.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Mr Pinch,&rsquo; said Pecksniff, taking up his handkerchief, as if he felt that
      he should want it soon, &lsquo;I will not dwell upon the past. I will spare you,
      and I will spare myself, that pain at least.&rsquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      Tom&rsquo;s was not a very bright eye, but it was a very expressive one when he
      looked at Mr Pecksniff, and said:
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Thank you, sir. I am very glad you will not refer to the past.&rsquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;The present is enough,&rsquo; said Mr Pecksniff, dropping a penny, &lsquo;and the
      sooner <i>that </i>is past, the better. Mr Pinch, I will not dismiss you without
      a word of explanation. Even such a course would be quite justifiable under
      the circumstances; but it might wear an appearance of hurry, and I will
      not do it; for I am,&rsquo; said Mr Pecksniff, knocking down another penny,
      &lsquo;perfectly self-possessed. Therefore I will say to you, what I have
      already said to Mr Chuzzlewit.&rsquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      Tom glanced at the old gentleman, who nodded now and then as approving of
      Mr Pecksniff&rsquo;s sentences and sentiments, but interposed between them in no
      other way.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;From fragments of a conversation which I overheard in the church, just
      now, Mr Pinch,&rsquo; said Pecksniff, &lsquo;between yourself and Miss Graham&mdash;I
      say fragments, because I was slumbering at a considerable distance from
      you, when I was roused by your voices&mdash;and from what I saw, I
      ascertained (I would have given a great deal not to have ascertained, Mr
      Pinch) that you, forgetful of all ties of duty and of honour, sir;
      regardless of the sacred laws of hospitality, to which you were pledged as
      an inmate of this house; have presumed to address Miss Graham with
      unreturned professions of attachment and proposals of love.&rsquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      Tom looked at him steadily.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Do you deny it, sir?&rsquo; asked Mr Pecksniff, dropping one pound two and
      fourpence, and making a great business of picking it up again.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;No, sir,&rsquo; replied Tom. &lsquo;I do not.&rsquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;You do not,&rsquo; said Mr Pecksniff, glancing at the old gentleman. &lsquo;Oblige me
      by counting this money, Mr Pinch, and putting your name to this receipt.
      You do not?&rsquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      No, Tom did not. He scorned to deny it. He saw that Mr Pecksniff having
      overheard his own disgrace, cared not a jot for sinking lower yet in his
      contempt. He saw that he had devised this fiction as the readiest means of
      getting rid of him at once, but that it must end in that any way. He saw
      that Mr Pecksniff reckoned on his not denying it, because his doing so and
      explaining would incense the old man more than ever against Martin and
      against Mary; while Pecksniff himself would only have been mistaken in his
      &lsquo;fragments.&rsquo; Deny it! No.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;You find the amount correct, do you, Mr Pinch?&rsquo; said Pecksniff.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Quite correct, sir,&rsquo; answered Tom.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;A person is waiting in the kitchen,&rsquo; said Mr Pecksniff, &lsquo;to carry your
      luggage wherever you please. We part, Mr Pinch, at once, and are strangers
      from this time.&rsquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      Something without a name; compassion, sorrow, old tenderness, mistaken
      gratitude, habit; none of these, and yet all of them; smote upon Tom&rsquo;s
      gentle heart at parting. There was no such soul as Pecksniff&rsquo;s in that
      carcase; and yet, though his speaking out had not involved the compromise
      of one he loved, he couldn&rsquo;t have denounced the very shape and figure of
      the man. Not even then.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;I will not say,&rsquo; cried Mr Pecksniff, shedding tears, &lsquo;what a blow this
      is. I will not say how much it tries me; how it works upon my nature; how
      it grates upon my feelings. I do not care for that. I can endure as well
      as another man. But what I have to hope, and what you have to hope, Mr
      Pinch (otherwise a great responsibility rests upon you), is, that this
      deception may not alter my ideas of humanity; that it may not impair my
      freshness, or contract, if I may use the expression, my Pinions. I hope it
      will not; I don&rsquo;t think it will. It may be a comfort to you, if not now,
      at some future time, to know that I shall endeavour not to think the worse
      of my fellow-creatures in general, for what has passed between us.
      Farewell!&rsquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      Tom had meant to spare him one little puncturation with a lancet, which he
      had it in his power to administer, but he changed his mind on hearing
      this, and said:
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;I think you left something in the church, sir.&rsquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Thank you, Mr Pinch,&rsquo; said Pecksniff. &lsquo;I am not aware that I did.&rsquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;This is your double eye-glass, I believe?&rsquo; said Tom.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Oh!&rsquo; cried Pecksniff, with some degree of confusion. &lsquo;I am obliged to
      you. Put it down, if you please.&rsquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;I found it,&rsquo; said Tom, slowly&mdash;&lsquo;when I went to bolt the
      vestry-window&mdash;in the pew.&rsquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      So he had. Mr Pecksniff had taken it off when he was bobbing up and down,
      lest it should strike against the panelling; and had forgotten it. Going
      back to the church with his mind full of having been watched, and
      wondering very much from what part, Tom&rsquo;s attention was caught by the door
      of the state pew standing open. Looking into it he found the glass. And
      thus he knew, and by returning it gave Mr Pecksniff the information that
      he knew, where the listener had been; and that instead of overhearing
      fragments of the conversation, he must have rejoiced in every word of it.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;I am glad he&rsquo;s gone,&rsquo; said Martin, drawing a long breath when Tom had
      left the room.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;It <i>is</i> a relief,&rsquo; assented Mr Pecksniff. &lsquo;It is a great relief. But having
      discharged&mdash;I hope with tolerable firmness&mdash;the duty which I
      owed to society, I will now, my dear sir, if you will give me leave,
      retire to shed a few tears in the back garden, as an humble individual.&rsquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      Tom went upstairs; cleared his shelf of books; packed them up with his
      music and an old fiddle in his trunk; got out his clothes (they were not
      so many that they made his head ache); put them on the top of his books;
      and went into the workroom for his case of instruments. There was a ragged
      stool there, with the horsehair all sticking out of the top like a wig: a
      very Beast of a stool in itself; on which he had taken up his daily seat,
      year after year, during the whole period of his service. They had grown
      older and shabbier in company. Pupils had served their time; seasons had
      come and gone. Tom and the worn-out stool had held together through it
      all. That part of the room was traditionally called &lsquo;Tom&rsquo;s Corner.&rsquo; It had
      been assigned to him at first because of its being situated in a strong
      draught, and a great way from the fire; and he had occupied it ever since.
      There were portraits of him on the walls, with all his weak points
      monstrously portrayed. Diabolical sentiments, foreign to his character,
      were represented as issuing from his mouth in fat balloons. Every pupil
      had added something, even unto fancy portraits of his father with one eye,
      and of his mother with a disproportionate nose, and especially of his
      sister; who always being presented as extremely beautiful, made full
      amends to Tom for any other jokes. Under less uncommon circumstances, it
      would have cut Tom to the heart to leave these things and think that he
      saw them for the last time; but it didn&rsquo;t now. There was no Pecksniff;
      there never had been a Pecksniff; and all his other griefs were swallowed
      up in that.
    </p>
    <p>
      So, when he returned into the bedroom, and, having fastened his box and a
      carpet-bag, put on his walking gaiters, and his great-coat, and his hat,
      and taken his stick in his hand, looked round it for the last time. Early
      on summer mornings, and by the light of private candle-ends on winter
      nights, he had read himself half blind in this same room. He had tried in
      this same room to learn the fiddle under the bedclothes, but yielding to
      objections from the other pupils, had reluctantly abandoned the design. At
      any other time he would have parted from it with a pang, thinking of all
      he had learned there, of the many hours he had passed there; for the love
      of his very dreams. But there was no Pecksniff; there never had been a
      Pecksniff, and the unreality of Pecksniff extended itself to the chamber,
      in which, sitting on one particular bed, the thing supposed to be that
      Great Abstraction had often preached morality with such effect that Tom
      had felt a moisture in his eyes, while hanging breathless on the words.
    </p>
    <p>
      The man engaged to bear his box&mdash;Tom knew him well: a Dragon man&mdash;came
      stamping up the stairs, and made a roughish bow to Tom (to whom in common
      times he would have nodded with a grin) as though he were aware of what
      had happened, and wished him to perceive it made no difference to <i>him</i>. It
      was clumsily done; he was a mere waterer of horses; but Tom liked the man
      for it, and felt it more than going away.
    </p>
    <p>
      Tom would have helped him with the box, but he made no more of it, though
      it was a heavy one, than an elephant would have made of a castle; just
      swinging it on his back and bowling downstairs as if, being naturally a
      heavy sort of fellow, he could carry a box infinitely better than he could
      go alone. Tom took the carpet-bag, and went downstairs along with him. At
      the outer door stood Jane, crying with all her might; and on the steps was
      Mrs Lupin, sobbing bitterly, and putting out her hand for Tom to shake.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;You&rsquo;re coming to the Dragon, Mr Pinch?&rsquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;No,&rsquo; said Tom, &lsquo;no. I shall walk to Salisbury to-night. I couldn&rsquo;t stay
      here. For goodness&rsquo; sake, don&rsquo;t make me so unhappy, Mrs Lupin.&rsquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;But you&rsquo;ll come to the Dragon, Mr Pinch. If it&rsquo;s only for tonight. To see
      me, you know; not as a traveller.&rsquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;God bless my soul!&rsquo; said Tom, wiping his eyes. &lsquo;The kindness of people is
      enough to break one&rsquo;s heart! I mean to go to Salisbury to-night, my dear
      good creature. If you&rsquo;ll take care of my box for me till I write for it, I
      shall consider it the greatest kindness you can do me.&rsquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;I wish,&rsquo; cried Mrs Lupin, &lsquo;there were twenty boxes, Mr Pinch, that I
      might have &lsquo;em all.&rsquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Thank&rsquo;ee,&rsquo; said Tom. &lsquo;It&rsquo;s like you. Good-bye. Good-bye.&rsquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      There were several people, young and old, standing about the door, some of
      whom cried with Mrs Lupin; while others tried to keep up a stout heart, as
      Tom did; and others were absorbed in admiration of Mr Pecksniff&mdash;a
      man who could build a church, as one may say, by squinting at a sheet of
      paper; and others were divided between that feeling and sympathy with Tom.
      Mr Pecksniff had appeared on the top of the steps, simultaneously with his
      old pupil, and while Tom was talking with Mrs Lupin kept his hand
      stretched out, as though he said &lsquo;Go forth!&rsquo; When Tom went forth, and had
      turned the corner Mr Pecksniff shook his head, shut his eyes, and heaving
      a deep sigh, shut the door. On which, the best of Tom&rsquo;s supporters said he
      must have done some dreadful deed, or such a man as Mr Pecksniff never
      could have felt like that. If it had been a common quarrel (they
      observed), he would have said something, but when he didn&rsquo;t, Mr Pinch must
      have shocked him dreadfully.

    <p>
      Tom was out of hearing of their shrewd opinions, and plodded on as
      steadily as he could go, until he came within sight of the turnpike where
      the tollman&rsquo;s family had cried out &lsquo;Mr Pinch!&rsquo; that frosty morning, when
      he went to meet young Martin. He had got through the village, and this
      toll-bar was his last trial; but when the infant toll-takers came
      screeching out, he had half a mind to run for it, and make a bolt across
      the country.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Why, deary Mr Pinch! oh, deary sir!&rsquo; cried the tollman&rsquo;s wife. &lsquo;What an
      unlikely time for you to be a-going this way with a bag!&rsquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;I am going to Salisbury,&rsquo; said Tom.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Why, goodness, where&rsquo;s the gig, then?&rsquo; cried the tollman&rsquo;s wife, looking
      down the road, as if she thought Tom might have been upset without
      observing it.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;I haven&rsquo;t got it,&rsquo; said Tom. &lsquo;I&mdash;&rsquo; he couldn&rsquo;t evade it; he felt she
      would have him in the next question, if he got over this one. &lsquo;I have left
      Mr Pecksniff.&rsquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      The tollman&mdash;a crusty customer, always smoking solitary pipes in a
      Windsor chair, inside, set artfully between two little windows that looked
      up and down the road, so that when he saw anything coming up he might hug
      himself on having toll to take, and when he saw it going down, might hug
      himself on having taken it&mdash;the tollman was out in an instant.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Left Mr Pecksniff!&rsquo; cried the tollman.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Yes,&rsquo; said Tom, &lsquo;left him.&rsquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      The tollman looked at his wife, uncertain whether to ask her if she had
      anything to suggest, or to order her to mind the children. Astonishment
      making him surly, he preferred the latter, and sent her into the
      toll-house with a flea in her ear.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;You left Mr Pecksniff!&rsquo; cried the tollman, folding his arms, and
      spreading his legs. &lsquo;I should as soon have thought of his head leaving
      him.&rsquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Aye!&rsquo; said Tom, &lsquo;so should I, yesterday. Good night!&rsquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      If a heavy drove of oxen hadn&rsquo;t come by immediately, the tollman would
      have gone down to the village straight, to inquire into it. As things
      turned out, he smoked another pipe, and took his wife into his confidence.
      But their united sagacity could make nothing of it, and they went to bed&mdash;metaphorically&mdash;in
      the dark. But several times that night, when a waggon or other vehicle
      came through, and the driver asked the tollkeeper &lsquo;What news?&rsquo; he looked
      at the man by the light of his lantern, to assure himself that he had an
      interest in the subject, and then said, wrapping his watch-coat round his
      legs:
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;You&rsquo;ve heerd of Mr Pecksniff down yonder?&rsquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Ah! sure-ly!&rsquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;And of his young man Mr Pinch, p&rsquo;raps?&rsquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Ah!&rsquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;They&rsquo;ve parted.&rsquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      After every one of these disclosures, the tollman plunged into his house
      again, and was seen no more, while the other side went on in great
      amazement.
    </p>
    <p>
      But this was long after Tom was abed, and Tom was now with his face
      towards Salisbury, doing his best to get there. The evening was beautiful
      at first, but it became cloudy and dull at sunset, and the rain fell
      heavily soon afterwards. For ten long miles he plodded on, wet through,
      until at last the lights appeared, and he came into the welcome precincts
      of the city.
    </p>
    <p>
      He went to the inn where he had waited for Martin, and briefly answering
      their inquiries after Mr Pecksniff, ordered a bed. He had no heart for tea
      or supper, meat or drink of any kind, but sat by himself before an empty
      table in the public room while the bed was getting ready, revolving in his
      mind all that had happened that eventful day, and wondering what he could
      or should do for the future. It was a great relief when the chambermaid
      came in, and said the bed was ready.
    </p>
    <p>
      It was a low four-poster, shelving downward in the centre like a trough,
      and the room was crowded with impracticable tables and exploded chests of
      drawers, full of damp linen. A graphic representation in oil of a
      remarkably fat ox hung over the fireplace, and the portrait of some former
      landlord (who might have been the ox&rsquo;s brother, he was so like him) stared
      roundly in, at the foot of the bed. A variety of queer smells were
      partially quenched in the prevailing scent of very old lavender; and the
      window had not been opened for such a long space of time that it pleaded
      immemorial usage, and wouldn&rsquo;t come open now.
    </p>
    <p>
      These were trifles in themselves, but they added to the strangeness of the
      place, and did not induce Tom to forget his new position. Pecksniff had
      gone out of the world&mdash;had never been in it&mdash;and it was as much
      as Tom could do to say his prayers without him. But he felt happier
      afterwards, and went to sleep, and dreamed about him as he Never Was.

      CHAPTER THIRTY-TWO
    </h2>
    <p>
      TREATS OF TODGER&rsquo;S AGAIN; AND OF ANOTHER BLIGHTED PLANT BESIDES THE PLANTS
      UPON THE LEADS
    </p>
    <p>
      Early on the day next after that on which she bade adieu to the halls of
      her youth and the scenes of her childhood, Miss Pecksniff, arriving safely
      at the coach-office in London, was there received, and conducted to her
      peaceful home beneath the shadow of the Monument, by Mrs Todgers. M.
      Todgers looked a little worn by cares of gravy and other such solicitudes
      arising out of her establishment, but displayed her usual earnestness and
      warmth of manner.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;And how, my sweet Miss Pecksniff,&rsquo; said she, &lsquo;how is your princely pa?&rsquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      Miss Pecksniff signified (in confidence) that he contemplated the
      introduction of a princely ma; and repeated the sentiment that she wasn&rsquo;t
      blind, and wasn&rsquo;t quite a fool, and wouldn&rsquo;t bear it.
    </p>
    <p>
      Mrs Todgers was more shocked by the intelligence than any one could have
      expected. She was quite bitter. She said there was no truth in man and
      that the warmer he expressed himself, as a general principle, the falser
      and more treacherous he was. She foresaw with astonishing clearness that
      the object of Mr Pecksniff&rsquo;s attachment was designing, worthless, and
      wicked; and receiving from Charity the fullest confirmation of these
      views, protested with tears in her eyes that she loved Miss Pecksniff like
      a sister, and felt her injuries as if they were her own.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Your real darling sister, I have not seen her more than once since her
      marriage,&rsquo; said Mrs Todgers, &lsquo;and then I thought her looking poorly. My
      sweet Miss Pecksniff, I always thought that you was to be the lady?&rsquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Oh dear no!&rsquo; cried Cherry, shaking her head. &lsquo;Oh no, Mrs Todgers. Thank
      you. No! not for any consideration he could offer.&rsquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;I dare say you are right,&rsquo; said Mrs Todgers with a sigh. &lsquo;I feared it all
      along. But the misery we have had from that match, here among ourselves,
      in this house, my dear Miss Pecksniff, nobody would believe.&rsquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Lor, Mrs Todgers!&rsquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Awful, awful!&rsquo; repeated Mrs Todgers, with strong emphasis. &lsquo;You recollect
      our youngest gentleman, my dear?&rsquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Of course I do,&rsquo; said Cherry.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;You might have observed,&rsquo; said Mrs Todgers, &lsquo;how he used to watch your
      sister; and that a kind of stony dumbness came over him whenever she was
      in company?&rsquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;I am sure I never saw anything of the sort,&rsquo; said Cherry, in a peevish
      manner. &lsquo;What nonsense, Mrs Todgers!&rsquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;My dear,&rsquo; returned that lady in a hollow voice, &lsquo;I have seen him again
      and again, sitting over his pie at dinner, with his spoon a perfect
      fixture in his mouth, looking at your sister. I have seen him standing in
      a corner of our drawing-room, gazing at her, in such a lonely, melancholy
      state, that he was more like a Pump than a man, and might have drawed
      tears.&rsquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;I never saw it!&rsquo; cried Cherry; &lsquo;that&rsquo;s all I can say.&rsquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;But when the marriage took place,&rsquo; said Mrs Todgers, proceeding with her
      subject, &lsquo;when it was in the paper, and was read out here at breakfast, I
      thought he had taken leave of his senses, I did indeed. The violence of
      that young man, my dear Miss Pecksniff; the frightful opinions he
      expressed upon the subject of self-destruction; the extraordinary actions
      he performed with his tea; the clenching way in which he bit his bread and
      butter; the manner in which he taunted Mr Jinkins; all combined to form a
      picture never to be forgotten.&rsquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;It&rsquo;s a pity he didn&rsquo;t destroy himself, I think,&rsquo; observed Miss Pecksniff.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Himself!&rsquo; said Mrs Todgers, &lsquo;it took another turn at night. He was for
      destroying other people then. There was a little chaffing going on&mdash;I
      hope you don&rsquo;t consider that a low expression, Miss Pecksniff; it is
      always in our gentlemen&rsquo;s mouths&mdash;a little chaffing going on, my
      dear, among &lsquo;em, all in good nature, when suddenly he rose up, foaming
      with his fury, and but for being held by three would have had Mr Jinkins&rsquo;s
      life with a bootjack.&rsquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      Miss Pecksniff&rsquo;s face expressed supreme indifference.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;And now,&rsquo; said Mrs Todgers, &lsquo;now he is the meekest of men. You can almost
      bring the tears into his eyes by looking at him. He sits with me the whole
      day long on Sundays, talking in such a dismal way that I find it next to
      impossible to keep my spirits up equal to the accommodation of the
      boarders. His only comfort is in female society. He takes me half-price to
      the play, to an extent which I sometimes fear is beyond his means; and I
      see the tears a-standing in his eyes during the whole performance&mdash;particularly
      if it is anything of a comic nature. The turn I experienced only
      yesterday,&rsquo; said Mrs Todgers putting her hand to her side, &lsquo;when the
      house-maid threw his bedside carpet out of the window of his room, while I
      was sitting here, no one can imagine. I thought it was him, and that he
      had done it at last!&rsquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      The contempt with which Miss Charity received this pathetic account of the
      state to which the youngest gentleman in company was reduced, did not say
      much for her power of sympathising with that unfortunate character. She
      treated it with great levity, and went on to inform herself, then and
      afterwards, whether any other changes had occurred in the commercial
      boarding-house.
    </p>
    <p>
      Mr Bailey was gone, and had been succeeded (such is the decay of human
      greatness!) by an old woman whose name was reported to be Tamaroo&mdash;which
      seemed an impossibility. Indeed it appeared in the fullness of time that
      the jocular boarders had appropriated the word from an English ballad, in
      which it is supposed to express the bold and fiery nature of a certain
      hackney coachman; and that it was bestowed upon Mr Bailey&rsquo;s successor by
      reason of her having nothing fiery about her, except an occasional attack
      of that fire which is called St. Anthony&rsquo;s. This ancient female had been
      engaged, in fulfillment of a vow, registered by Mrs Todgers, that no more
      boys should darken the commercial doors; and she was chiefly remarkable
      for a total absence of all comprehension upon every subject whatever. She
      was a perfect Tomb for messages and small parcels; and when dispatched to
      the Post Office with letters, had been frequently seen endeavouring to
      insinuate them into casual chinks in private doors, under the delusion
      that any door with a hole in it would answer the purpose. She was a very
      little old woman, and always wore a very coarse apron with a bib before
      and a loop behind, together with bandages on her wrists, which appeared to
      be afflicted with an everlasting sprain. She was on all occasions chary of
      opening the street door, and ardent to shut it again; and she waited at
      table in a bonnet.
    </p>
    <p>
      This was the only great change over and above the change which had fallen
      on the youngest gentleman. As for him, he more than corroborated the
      account of Mrs Todgers; possessing greater sensibility than even she had
      given him credit for. He entertained some terrible notions of Destiny,
      among other matters, and talked much about people&rsquo;s &lsquo;Missions&rsquo;; upon which
      he seemed to have some private information not generally attainable, as he
      knew it had been poor Merry&rsquo;s mission to crush him in the bud. He was very
      frail and tearful; for being aware that a shepherd&rsquo;s mission was to pipe
      to his flocks, and that a boatswain&rsquo;s mission was to pipe all hands, and
      that one man&rsquo;s mission was to be a paid piper, and another man&rsquo;s mission
      was to pay the piper, so he had got it into his head that his own peculiar
      mission was to pipe his eye. Which he did perpetually.
    </p>
    <p>
      He often informed Mrs Todgers that the sun had set upon him; that the
      billows had rolled over him; that the car of Juggernaut had crushed him,
      and also that the deadly Upas tree of Java had blighted him. His name was
      Moddle.
    </p>
    <p>
      Towards this most unhappy Moddle, Miss Pecksniff conducted herself at
      first with distant haughtiness, being in no humour to be entertained with
      dirges in honour of her married sister. The poor young gentleman was
      additionally crushed by this, and remonstrated with Mrs Todgers on the
      subject.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Even she turns from me, Mrs Todgers,&rsquo; said Moddle.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Then why don&rsquo;t you try and be a little bit more cheerful, sir?&rsquo; retorted
      Mrs Todgers.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Cheerful, Mrs Todgers! cheerful!&rsquo; cried the youngest gentleman; &lsquo;when she
      reminds me of days for ever fled, Mrs Todgers!&rsquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Then you had better avoid her for a short time, if she does,&rsquo; said Mrs
      Todgers, &lsquo;and come to know her again, by degrees. That&rsquo;s my advice.&rsquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;But I can&rsquo;t avoid her,&rsquo; replied Moddle, &lsquo;I haven&rsquo;t strength of mind to do
      it. Oh, Mrs Todgers, if you knew what a comfort her nose is to me!&rsquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Her nose, sir!&rsquo; Mrs Todgers cried.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Her profile, in general,&rsquo; said the youngest gentleman, &lsquo;but particularly
      her nose. It&rsquo;s so like;&rsquo; here he yielded to a burst of grief. &lsquo;It&rsquo;s so
      like hers who is Another&rsquo;s, Mrs Todgers!&rsquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      The observant matron did not fail to report this conversation to Charity,
      who laughed at the time, but treated Mr Moddle that very evening with
      increased consideration, and presented her side face to him as much as
      possible. Mr Moddle was not less sentimental than usual; was rather more
      so, if anything; but he sat and stared at her with glistening eyes, and
      seemed grateful.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Well, sir!&rsquo; said the lady of the Boarding-House next day. &lsquo;You held up
      your head last night. You&rsquo;re coming round, I think.&rsquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Only because she&rsquo;s so like her who is Another&rsquo;s, Mrs Todgers,&rsquo; rejoined
      the youth. &lsquo;When she talks, and when she smiles, I think I&rsquo;m looking on
      <i>her </i>brow again, Mrs Todgers.&rsquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      This was likewise carried to Charity, who talked and smiled next evening
      in her most engaging manner, and rallying Mr Moddle on the lowness of his
      spirits, challenged him to play a rubber at cribbage. Mr Moddle taking up
      the gauntlet, they played several rubbers for sixpences, and Charity won
      them all. This may have been partially attributable to the gallantry of
      the youngest gentleman, but it was certainly referable to the state of his
      feelings also; for his eyes being frequently dimmed by tears, he thought
      that aces were tens, and knaves queens, which at times occasioned some
      confusion in his play.
    </p>
    <p>
      On the seventh night of cribbage, when Mrs Todgers, sitting by, proposed
      that instead of gambling they should play for &lsquo;love,&rsquo; Mr Moddle was seen
      to change colour. On the fourteenth night, he kissed Miss Pecksniff&rsquo;s
      snuffers, in the passage, when she went upstairs to bed; meaning to have
      kissed her hand, but missing it.
    </p>
    <p>
      In short, Mr Moddle began to be impressed with the idea that Miss
      Pecksniff&rsquo;s mission was to comfort him; and Miss Pecksniff began to
      speculate on the probability of its being her mission to become ultimately
      Mrs Moddle. He was a young gentleman (Miss Pecksniff was not a very young
      lady) with rising prospects, and &lsquo;almost&rsquo; enough to live on. Really it
      looked very well.
    </p>
    <p>
      Besides&mdash;besides&mdash;he had been regarded as devoted to Merry.
      Merry had joked about him, and had once spoken of it to her sister as a
      conquest. He was better looking, better shaped, better spoken, better
      tempered, better mannered than Jonas. He was easy to manage, could be made
      to consult the humours of his Betrothed, and could be shown off like a
      lamb when Jonas was a bear. There was the rub!
    </p>
    <p>
      In the meantime the cribbage went on, and Mrs Todgers went off; for the
      youngest gentleman, dropping her society, began to take Miss Pecksniff to
      the play. He also began, as Mrs Todgers said, to slip home &lsquo;in his
      dinner-times,&rsquo; and to get away from &lsquo;the office&rsquo; at unholy seasons; and
      twice, as he informed Mrs Todgers himself, he received anonymous letters,
      enclosing cards from Furniture Warehouses&mdash;clearly the act of that
      ungentlemanly ruffian Jinkins; only he hadn&rsquo;t evidence enough to call him
      out upon. All of which, so Mrs Todgers told Miss Pecksniff, spoke as plain
      English as the shining sun.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;My dear Miss Pecksniff, you may depend upon it,&rsquo; said Mrs Todgers, &lsquo;that
      he is burning to propose.&rsquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;My goodness me, why don&rsquo;t he then?&rsquo; cried Cherry.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Men are so much more timid than we think &lsquo;em, my dear,&rsquo; returned Mrs
      Todgers. &lsquo;They baulk themselves continually. I saw the words on Todgers&rsquo;s
      lips for months and months and months, before he said &lsquo;em.&rsquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      Miss Pecksniff submitted that Todgers might not have been a fair specimen.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Oh yes, he was. Oh bless you, yes, my dear. I was very particular in
      those days, I assure you,&rsquo; said Mrs Todgers, bridling. &lsquo;No, no. You give
      Mr Moddle a little encouragement, Miss Pecksniff, if you wish him to
      speak; and he&rsquo;ll speak fast enough, depend upon it.&rsquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;I am sure I don&rsquo;t know what encouragement he would have, Mrs Todgers,&rsquo;
      returned Charity. &lsquo;He walks with me, and plays cards with me, and he comes
      and sits alone with me.&rsquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Quite right,&rsquo; said Mrs Todgers. &lsquo;That&rsquo;s indispensable, my dear.&rsquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;And he sits very close to me.&rsquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Also quite correct,&rsquo; said Mrs Todgers.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;And he looks at me.&rsquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;To be sure he does,&rsquo; said Mrs Todgers.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;And he has his arm upon the back of the chair or sofa, or whatever it is&mdash;behind
      me, you know.&rsquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;I should think so,&rsquo; said Mrs Todgers.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;And then he begins to cry!&rsquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      Mrs Todgers admitted that he might do better than that; and might
      undoubtedly profit by the recollection of the great Lord Nelson&rsquo;s signal
      at the battle of Trafalgar. Still, she said, he would come round, or, not
      to mince the matter, would be brought round, if Miss Pecksniff took up a
      decided position, and plainly showed him that it must be done.
    </p>
    <p>
      Determining to regulate her conduct by this opinion, the young lady
      received Mr Moddle, on the earliest subsequent occasion, with an air of
      constraint; and gradually leading him to inquire, in a dejected manner,
      why she was so changed, confessed to him that she felt it necessary for
      their mutual peace and happiness to take a decided step. They had been
      much together lately, she observed, much together, and had tasted the
      sweets of a genuine reciprocity of sentiment. She never could forget him,
      nor could she ever cease to think of him with feelings of the liveliest
      friendship, but people had begun to talk, the thing had been observed, and
      it was necessary that they should be nothing more to each other, than any
      gentleman and lady in society usually are. She was glad she had had the
      resolution to say thus much before her feelings had been tried too far;
      they had been greatly tried, she would admit; but though she was weak and
      silly, she would soon get the better of it, she hoped.
    </p>
    <p>
      Moddle, who had by this time become in the last degree maudlin, and wept
      abundantly, inferred from the foregoing avowal, that it was his mission to
      communicate to others the blight which had fallen on himself; and that,
      being a kind of unintentional Vampire, he had had Miss Pecksniff assigned
      to him by the Fates, as Victim Number One. Miss Pecksniff controverting
      this opinion as sinful, Moddle was goaded on to ask whether she could be
      contented with a blighted heart; and it appearing on further examination
      that she could be, plighted his dismal troth, which was accepted and
      returned.
      He bore his good fortune with the utmost moderation. Instead of being
      triumphant, he shed more tears than he had ever been known to shed before;
      and, sobbing, said:
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Oh! what a day this has been! I can&rsquo;t go back to the office this
      afternoon. Oh, what a trying day this has been! Good Gracious!&rsquo;

      CHAPTER THIRTY-THREE
    </h2>
    <p>
      FURTHER PROCEEDINGS IN EDEN, AND A PROCEEDING OUT OF IT. MARTIN MAKES A
      DISCOVERY OF SOME IMPORTANCE
    </p>
    <p>
      From Mr Moddle to Eden is an easy and natural transition. Mr Moddle,
      living in the atmosphere of Miss Pecksniff&rsquo;s love, dwelt (if he had but
      known it) in a terrestrial Paradise. The thriving city of Eden was also a
      terrestrial Paradise, upon the showing of its proprietors. The beautiful
      Miss Pecksniff might have been poetically described as a something too
      good for man in his fallen and degraded state. That was exactly the
      character of the thriving city of Eden, as poetically heightened by
      Zephaniah Scadder, General Choke, and other worthies; part and parcel of
      the talons of that great American Eagle, which is always airing itself
      sky-high in purest aether, and never, no never, never, tumbles down with
      draggled wings into the mud.
    </p>
    <p>
      When Mark Tapley, leaving Martin in the architectural and surveying
      offices, had effectually strengthened and encouraged his own spirits by
      the contemplation of their joint misfortunes, he proceeded, with new
      cheerfulness, in search of help; congratulating himself, as he went along,
      on the enviable position to which he had at last attained.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;I used to think, sometimes,&rsquo; said Mr Tapley, &lsquo;as a desolate island would
      suit me, but I should only have had myself to provide for there, and being
      naturally a easy man to manage, there wouldn&rsquo;t have been much credit in
      <i>that</i>. Now here I&rsquo;ve got my partner to take care on, and he&rsquo;s something
      like the sort of man for the purpose. I want a man as is always a-sliding
      off his legs when he ought to be on &lsquo;em. I want a man as is so low down in
      the school of life that he&rsquo;s always a-making figures of one in his
      copy-book, and can&rsquo;t get no further. I want a man as is his own great coat
      and cloak, and is always a-wrapping himself up in himself. And I have got
      him too,&rsquo; said Mr Tapley, after a moment&rsquo;s silence. &lsquo;What a happiness!&rsquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      He paused to look round, uncertain to which of the log-houses he should
      repair.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;I don&rsquo;t know which to take,&rsquo; he observed; &lsquo;that&rsquo;s the truth. They&rsquo;re
      equally prepossessing outside, and equally commodious, no doubt, within;
      being fitted up with every convenience that a Alligator, in a state of
      natur&rsquo;, could possibly require. Let me see! The citizen as turned out last
      night, lives under water, in the right hand dog-kennel at the corner. I
      don&rsquo;t want to trouble him if I can help it, poor man, for he is a
      melancholy object; a reg&rsquo;lar Settler in every respect. There&rsquo;s house with
      a winder, but I am afraid of their being proud. I don&rsquo;t know whether a
      door ain&rsquo;t too aristocratic; but here goes for the first one!&rsquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      He went up to the nearest cabin, and knocked with his hand. Being desired
      to enter, he complied.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Neighbour,&rsquo; said Mark; &lsquo;for I <i>am</i> a neighbour, though you don&rsquo;t know me;
      I&rsquo;ve come a-begging. Hallo! hal&mdash;lo! Am I a-bed, and dreaming!&rsquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      He made this exclamation on hearing his own name pronounced, and finding
      himself clasped about the skirts by two little boys, whose faces he had
      often washed, and whose suppers he had often cooked, on board of that
      noble and fast-sailing line-of-packet ship, the Screw.
    </p>

      <a href="images/20534.jpg"><i>Original</i></a>
    </h5>
    <p>
      &lsquo;My eyes is wrong!&rsquo; said Mark. &lsquo;I don&rsquo;t believe &lsquo;em. That ain&rsquo;t my
      fellow-passenger younder, a-nursing her little girl, who, I am sorry to
      see, is so delicate; and that ain&rsquo;t her husband as come to New York to
      fetch her. Nor these,&rsquo; he added, looking down upon the boys, &lsquo;ain&rsquo;t them
      two young shavers as was so familiar to me; though they are uncommon like
      &lsquo;em. That I must confess.&rsquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      The woman shed tears, in very joy to see him; the man shook both his hands
      and would not let them go; the two boys hugged his legs; the sick child in
      the mother&rsquo;s arms stretched out her burning little fingers, and muttered,
      in her hoarse, dry throat, his well-remembered name.
    </p>
    <p>
      It was the same family, sure enough. Altered by the salubrious air of
      Eden. But the same.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;This is a new sort of a morning call,&rsquo; said Mark, drawing a long breath.
      &lsquo;It strikes one all of a heap. Wait a little bit! I&rsquo;m a-coming round fast.
      That&rsquo;ll do! These gentlemen ain&rsquo;t my friends. Are they on the visiting
      list of the house?&rsquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      The inquiry referred to certain gaunt pigs, who had walked in after him,
      and were much interested in the heels of the family. As they did not
      belong to the mansion, they were expelled by the two little boys.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;I ain&rsquo;t superstitious about toads,&rsquo; said Mark, looking round the room,
      &lsquo;but if you could prevail upon the two or three I see in company, to step
      out at the same time, my young friends, I think they&rsquo;d find the open air
      refreshing. Not that I at all object to &lsquo;em. A very handsome animal is a
      toad,&rsquo; said Mr Tapley, sitting down upon a stool; &lsquo;very spotted; very like
      a partickler style of old gentleman about the throat; very bright-eyed,
      very cool, and very slippy. But one sees &lsquo;em to the best advantage out of
      doors perhaps.&rsquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      While pretending, with such talk as this, to be perfectly at his ease, and
      to be the most indifferent and careless of men, Mark Tapley had an eye on
      all around him. The wan and meagre aspect of the family, the changed looks
      of the poor mother, the fevered child she held in her lap, the air of
      great despondency and little hope on everything, were plain to him, and
      made a deep impression on his mind. He saw it all as clearly and as
      quickly, as with his bodily eyes he saw the rough shelves supported by
      pegs driven between the logs, of which the house was made; the flour-cask
      in the corner, serving also for a table; the blankets, spades, and other
      articles against the walls; the damp that blotched the ground; or the crop
      of vegetable rottenness in every crevice of the hut.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;How is it that you have come here?&rsquo; asked the man, when their first
      expressions of surprise were over.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Why, we come by the steamer last night,&rsquo; replied Mark. &lsquo;Our intention is
      to make our fortuns with punctuality and dispatch; and to retire upon our
      property as soon as ever it&rsquo;s realised. But how are you all? You&rsquo;re
      looking noble!&rsquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;We are but sickly now,&rsquo; said the poor woman, bending over her child. &lsquo;But
      we shall do better when we are seasoned to the place.&rsquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;There are some here,&rsquo; thought Mark &lsquo;whose seasoning will last for ever.&rsquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      But he said cheerfully, &lsquo;Do better! To be sure you will. We shall all do
      better. What we&rsquo;ve got to do is, to keep up our spirits, and be
      neighbourly. We shall come all right in the end, never fear. That reminds
      me, by the bye, that my partner&rsquo;s all wrong just at present; and that I
      looked in to beg for him. I wish you&rsquo;d come and give me your opinion of
      him, master.&rsquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      That must have been a very unreasonable request on the part of Mark
      Tapley, with which, in their gratitude for his kind offices on board the
      ship, they would not have complied instantly. The man rose to accompany
      him without a moment&rsquo;s delay. Before they went, Mark took the sick child
      in his arms, and tried to comfort the mother; but the hand of death was on
      it then, he saw.
    </p>
    <p>
      They found Martin in the house, lying wrapped up in his blanket on the
      ground. He was, to all appearance, very ill indeed, and shook and shivered
      horribly; not as people do from cold, but in a frightful kind of spasm or
      convulsion, that racked his whole body. Mark&rsquo;s friend pronounced his
      disease an aggravated kind of fever, accompanied with ague; which was very
      common in those parts, and which he predicted would be worse to-morrow,
      and for many more to-morrows. He had had it himself off and on, he said,
      for a couple of years or so; but he was thankful that, while so many he
      had known had died about him, he had escaped with life.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;And with not too much of that,&rsquo; thought Mark, surveying his emaciated
      form. &lsquo;Eden for ever!&rsquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      They had some medicine in their chest; and this man of sad experience
      showed Mark how and when to administer it, and how he could best alleviate
      the sufferings of Martin. His attentions did not stop there; for he was
      backwards and forwards constantly, and rendered Mark good service in all
      his brisk attempts to make their situation more endurable. Hope or comfort
      for the future he could not bestow. The season was a sickly one; the
      settlement a grave. His child died that night; and Mark, keeping the
      secret from Martin, helped to bury it, beneath a tree, next day.
    </p>
    <p>
      With all his various duties of attendance upon Martin (who became the more
      exacting in his claims, the worse he grew), Mark worked out of doors,
      early and late; and with the assistance of his friend and others, laboured
      to do something with their land. Not that he had the least strength of
      heart or hope, or steady purpose in so doing, beyond the habitual
      cheerfulness of his disposition, and his amazing power of
      self-sustainment; for within himself, he looked on their condition as
      beyond all hope, and, in his own words, &lsquo;came out strong&rsquo; in consequence.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;As to coming out as strong as I could wish, sir,&rsquo; he confided to Martin
      in a leisure moment; that is to say, one evening, while he was washing the
      linen of the establishment, after a hard day&rsquo;s work, &lsquo;that I give up. It&rsquo;s
      a piece of good fortune as never is to happen to me, I see!&rsquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Would you wish for circumstances stronger than these?&rsquo; Martin retorted
      with a groan, from underneath his blanket.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Why, only see how easy they might have been stronger, sir,&rsquo; said Mark,
      &lsquo;if it wasn&rsquo;t for the envy of that uncommon fortun of mine, which is
      always after me, and tripping me up. The night we landed here, I thought
      things did look pretty jolly. I won&rsquo;t deny it. I thought they did look
      pretty jolly.&rsquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;How do they look now?&rsquo; groaned Martin.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Ah!&rsquo; said Mark, &lsquo;Ah, to be sure. That&rsquo;s the question. How do they look
      now? On the very first morning of my going out, what do I do? Stumble on a
      family I know, who are constantly assisting of us in all sorts of ways,
      from that time to this! That won&rsquo;t do, you know; that ain&rsquo;t what I&rsquo;d a
      right to expect. If I had stumbled on a serpent and got bit; or stumbled
      on a first-rate patriot, and got bowie-knifed, or stumbled on a lot of
      Sympathisers with inverted shirt-collars, and got made a lion of; I might
      have distinguished myself, and earned some credit. As it is, the great
      object of my voyage is knocked on the head. So it would be, wherever I
      went. How do you feel to-night, sir?&rsquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Worse than ever,&rsquo; said poor Martin.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;That&rsquo;s something,&rsquo; returned Mark, &lsquo;but not enough. Nothing but being very
      bad myself, and jolly to the last, will ever do me justice.&rsquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;In Heaven&rsquo;s name, don&rsquo;t talk of that,&rsquo; said Martin with a thrill of
      terror. &lsquo;What should I do, Mark, if you were taken ill!&rsquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      Mr Tapley&rsquo;s spirits appeared to be stimulated by this remark, although it
      was not a very flattering one. He proceeded with his washing in a brighter
      mood; and observed &lsquo;that his glass was arising.&rsquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;There&rsquo;s one good thing in this place, sir,&rsquo; said Mr Tapley, scrubbing
      away at the linen, &lsquo;as disposes me to be jolly; and that is that it&rsquo;s a
      reg&rsquo;lar little United States in itself. There&rsquo;s two or three American
      settlers left; and they coolly comes over one, even here, sir, as if it
      was the wholesomest and loveliest spot in the world. But they&rsquo;re like the
      cock that went and hid himself to save his life, and was found out by the
      noise he made. They can&rsquo;t help crowing. They was born to do it, and do it
      they must, whatever comes of it.&rsquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      Glancing from his work out at the door as he said these words, Mark&rsquo;s eyes
      encountered a lean person in a blue frock and a straw hat, with a short
      black pipe in his mouth, and a great hickory stick studded all over with
      knots, in his hand; who smoking and chewing as he came along, and spitting
      frequently, recorded his progress by a train of decomposed tobacco on the
      ground.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Here&rsquo;s one on &lsquo;em,&rsquo; cried Mark, &lsquo;Hannibal Chollop.&rsquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Don&rsquo;t let him in,&rsquo; said Martin, feebly.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;He won&rsquo;t want any letting in,&rsquo; replied Mark. &lsquo;He&rsquo;ll come in, sir.&rsquo; Which
      turned out to be quite true, for he did. His face was almost as hard and
      knobby as his stick; and so were his hands. His head was like an old black
      hearth-broom. He sat down on the chest with his hat on; and crossing his
      legs and looking up at Mark, said, without removing his pipe:
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Well, Mr Co.! and how do you git along, sir?&rsquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      It may be necessary to observe that Mr Tapley had gravely introduced
      himself to all strangers, by that name.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Pretty well, sir; pretty well,&rsquo; said Mark.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;If this ain&rsquo;t Mr Chuzzlewit, ain&rsquo;t it!&rsquo; exclaimed the visitor &lsquo;How do <i>you</i>
      git along, sir?&rsquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      Martin shook his head, and drew the blanket over it involuntarily; for he
      felt that Hannibal was going to spit; and his eye, as the song says, was
      upon him.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;You need not regard me, sir,&rsquo; observed Mr Chollop, complacently. &lsquo;I am
      fever-proof, and likewise agur.&rsquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Mine was a more selfish motive,&rsquo; said Martin, looking out again. &lsquo;I was
      afraid you were going to&mdash;&rsquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;I can calc&rsquo;late my distance, sir,&rsquo; returned Mr Chollop, &lsquo;to an inch.&rsquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      With a proof of which happy faculty he immediately favoured him.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;I re-quire, sir,&rsquo; said Hannibal, &lsquo;two foot clear in a circ&rsquo;lar
      di-rection, and can engage my-self toe keep within it. I <i>have </i>gone ten
      foot, in a circ&rsquo;lar di-rection, but that was for a wager.&rsquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;I hope you won it, sir,&rsquo; said Mark.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Well, sir, I realised the stakes,&rsquo; said Chollop. &lsquo;Yes, sir.&rsquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      He was silent for a time, during which he was actively engaged in the
      formation of a magic circle round the chest on which he sat. When it was
      completed, he began to talk again.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;How do you like our country, sir?&rsquo; he inquired, looking at Martin.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Not at all,&rsquo; was the invalid&rsquo;s reply.
    </p>
    <p>
      Chollop continued to smoke without the least appearance of emotion, until
      he felt disposed to speak again. That time at length arriving, he took his
      pipe from his mouth, and said:
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;I am not surprised to hear you say so. It re-quires An elevation, and A
      preparation of the intellect. The mind of man must be prepared for
      Freedom, Mr Co.&rsquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      He addressed himself to Mark; because he saw that Martin, who wished him
      to go, being already half-mad with feverish irritation, which the droning
      voice of this new horror rendered almost insupportable, had closed his
      eyes, and turned on his uneasy bed.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;A little bodily preparation wouldn&rsquo;t be amiss, either, would it, sir,&rsquo;
      said Mark, &lsquo;in the case of a blessed old swamp like this?&rsquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Do you con-sider this a swamp, sir?&rsquo; inquired Chollop gravely.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Why yes, sir,&rsquo; returned Mark. &lsquo;I haven&rsquo;t a doubt about it myself.&rsquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;The sentiment is quite Europian,&rsquo; said the major, &lsquo;and does not surprise
      me; what would your English millions say to such a swamp in England, sir?&rsquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;They&rsquo;d say it was an uncommon nasty one, I should think, said Mark; &lsquo;and
      that they would rather be inoculated for fever in some other way.&rsquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Europian!&rsquo; remarked Chollop, with sardonic pity. &lsquo;Quite Europian!&rsquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      And there he sat. Silent and cool, as if the house were his; smoking away
      like a factory chimney.
    </p>
    <p>
      Mr Chollop was, of course, one of the most remarkable men in the country;
      but he really was a notorious person besides. He was usually described by
      his friends, in the South and West, as &lsquo;a splendid sample of our na-tive
      raw material, sir,&rsquo; and was much esteemed for his devotion to rational
      Liberty; for the better propagation whereof he usually carried a brace of
      revolving pistols in his coat pocket, with seven barrels a-piece. He also
      carried, amongst other trinkets, a sword-stick, which he called his
      &lsquo;Tickler.&rsquo; and a great knife, which (for he was a man of a pleasant turn
      of humour) he called &lsquo;Ripper,&rsquo; in allusion to its usefulness as a means of
      ventilating the stomach of any adversary in a close contest. He had used
      these weapons with distinguished effect in several instances, all duly
      chronicled in the newspapers; and was greatly beloved for the gallant
      manner in which he had &lsquo;jobbed out&rsquo; the eye of one gentleman, as he was in
      the act of knocking at his own street-door.
    </p>
    <p>
      Mr Chollop was a man of a roving disposition; and, in any less advanced
      community, might have been mistaken for a violent vagabond. But his fine
      qualities being perfectly understood and appreciated in those regions
      where his lot was cast, and where he had many kindred spirits to consort
      with, he may be regarded as having been born under a fortunate star, which
      is not always the case with a man so much before the age in which he
      lives. Preferring, with a view to the gratification of his tickling and
      ripping fancies, to dwell upon the outskirts of society, and in the more
      remote towns and cities, he was in the habit of emigrating from place to
      place, and establishing in each some business&mdash;usually a newspaper&mdash;which
      he presently sold; for the most part closing the bargain by challenging,
      stabbing, pistolling, or gouging the new editor, before he had quite taken
      possession of the property.
    </p>
    <p>
      He had come to Eden on a speculation of this kind, but had abandoned it,
      and was about to leave. He always introduced himself to strangers as a
      worshipper of Freedom; was the consistent advocate of Lynch law, and
      slavery; and invariably recommended, both in print and speech, the
      &lsquo;tarring and feathering&rsquo; of any unpopular person who differed from
      himself. He called this &lsquo;planting the standard of civilization in the
      wilder gardens of My country.&rsquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      There is little doubt that Chollop would have planted this standard in
      Eden at Mark&rsquo;s expense, in return for his plainness of speech (for the
      genuine Freedom is dumb, save when she vaunts herself), but for the utter
      desolation and decay prevailing in the settlement, and his own approaching
      departure from it. As it was, he contented himself with showing Mark one
      of the revolving-pistols, and asking him what he thought of that weapon.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;It ain&rsquo;t long since I shot a man down with that, sir, in the State of
      Illin<i>oy</i>,&rsquo; observed Chollop.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Did you, indeed!&rsquo; said Mark, without the smallest agitation. &lsquo;Very free
      of you. And very independent!&rsquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;I shot him down, sir,&rsquo; pursued Chollop, &lsquo;for asserting in the Spartan
      Portico, a tri-weekly journal, that the ancient Athenians went a-head of
      the present Locofoco Ticket.&rsquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;And what&rsquo;s that?&rsquo; asked Mark.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Europian not to know,&rsquo; said Chollop, smoking placidly. &lsquo;Europian quite!&rsquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      After a short devotion to the interests of the magic circle, he resumed
      the conversation by observing:
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;You won&rsquo;t half feel yourself at home in Eden, now?&rsquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;No,&rsquo; said Mark, &lsquo;I don&rsquo;t.&rsquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;You miss the imposts of your country. You miss the house dues?&rsquo; observed
      Chollop.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;And the houses&mdash;rather,&rsquo; said Mark.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;No window dues here, sir,&rsquo; observed Chollop.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;And no windows to put &lsquo;em on,&rsquo; said Mark.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;No stakes, no dungeons, no blocks, no racks, no scaffolds, no
      thumbscrews, no pikes, no pillories,&rsquo; said Chollop.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Nothing but rewolwers and bowie-knives,&rsquo; returned Mark. &lsquo;And what are
      they? Not worth mentioning!&rsquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      The man who had met them on the night of their arrival came crawling up at
      this juncture, and looked in at the door.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Well, sir,&rsquo; said Chollop. &lsquo;How do <i>you </i>git along?&rsquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      He had considerable difficulty in getting along at all, and said as much
      in reply.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Mr Co. And me, sir,&rsquo; observed Chollop, &lsquo;are disputating a piece. He ought
      to be slicked up pretty smart to disputate between the Old World and the
      New, I do expect?&rsquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Well!&rsquo; returned the miserable shadow. &lsquo;So he had.&rsquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;I was merely observing, sir,&rsquo; said Mark, addressing this new visitor,
      &lsquo;that I looked upon the city in which we have the honour to live, as being
      swampy. What&rsquo;s your sentiments?&rsquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;I opinionate it&rsquo;s moist perhaps, at certain times,&rsquo; returned the man.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;But not as moist as England, sir?&rsquo; cried Chollop, with a fierce
      expression in his face.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Oh! Not as moist as England; let alone its Institutions,&rsquo; said the man.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;I should hope there ain&rsquo;t a swamp in all Americay, as don&rsquo;t whip <i>that</i>
      small island into mush and molasses,&rsquo; observed Chollop, decisively. &lsquo;You
      bought slick, straight, and right away, of Scadder, sir?&rsquo; to Mark.
    </p>
    <p>
      He answered in the affirmative. Mr Chollop winked at the other citizen.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Scadder is a smart man, sir? He is a rising man? He is a man as will come
      up&rsquo;ards, right side up, sir?&rsquo; Mr Chollop winked again at the other
      citizen.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;He should have his right side very high up, if I had my way,&rsquo; said Mark.
      &lsquo;As high up as the top of a good tall gallows, perhaps.&rsquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      Mr Chollop was so delighted at the smartness of his excellent countryman
      having been too much for the Britisher, and at the Britisher&rsquo;s resenting
      it, that he could contain himself no longer, and broke forth in a shout of
      delight. But the strangest exposition of this ruling passion was in the
      other&mdash;the pestilence-stricken, broken, miserable shadow of a man&mdash;who
      derived so much entertainment from the circumstance that he seemed to
      forget his own ruin in thinking of it, and laughed outright when he said
      &lsquo;that Scadder was a smart man, and had draw&rsquo;d a lot of British capital
      that way, as sure as sun-up.&rsquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      After a full enjoyment of this joke, Mr Hannibal Chollop sat smoking and
      improving the circle, without making any attempts either to converse or to
      take leave; apparently labouring under the not uncommon delusion that for
      a free and enlightened citizen of the United States to convert another
      man&rsquo;s house into a spittoon for two or three hours together, was a
      delicate attention, full of interest and politeness, of which nobody could
      ever tire. At last he rose.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;I am a-going easy,&rsquo; he observed.
    </p>
    <p>
      Mark entreated him to take particular care of himself.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Afore I go,&rsquo; he said sternly, &lsquo;I have got a leetle word to say to you.
      You are darnation &lsquo;cute, you are.&rsquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      Mark thanked him for the compliment.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;But you are much too &lsquo;cute to last. I can&rsquo;t con-ceive of any spotted
      Painter in the bush, as ever was so riddled through and through as you
      will be, I bet.&rsquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;What for?&rsquo; asked Mark.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;We must be cracked up, sir,&rsquo; retorted Chollop, in a tone of menace. &lsquo;You
      are not now in A despotic land. We are a model to the airth, and must be
      jist cracked-up, I tell you.&rsquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;What! I speak too free, do I?&rsquo; cried Mark.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;I have draw&rsquo;d upon A man, and fired upon A man for less,&rsquo; said Chollop,
      frowning. &lsquo;I have know&rsquo;d strong men obleeged to make themselves uncommon
      skase for less. I have know&rsquo;d men Lynched for less, and beaten into
      punkin&rsquo;-sarse for less, by an enlightened people. We are the intellect and
      virtue of the airth, the cream of human natur&rsquo;, and the flower Of moral
      force. Our backs is easy ris. We must be cracked-up, or they rises, and we
      snarls. We shows our teeth, I tell you, fierce. You&rsquo;d better crack us up,
      you had!&rsquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      After the delivery of this caution, Mr Chollop departed; with Ripper,
      Tickler, and the revolvers, all ready for action on the shortest notice.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Come out from under the blanket, sir,&rsquo; said Mark, &lsquo;he&rsquo;s gone. What&rsquo;s
      this!&rsquo; he added softly; kneeling down to look into his partner&rsquo;s face, and
      taking his hot hand. &lsquo;What&rsquo;s come of all that chattering and swaggering?
      He&rsquo;s wandering in his mind to-night, and don&rsquo;t know me!&rsquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      Martin indeed was dangerously ill; very near his death. He lay in that
      state many days, during which time Mark&rsquo;s poor friends, regardless of
      themselves, attended him. Mark, fatigued in mind and body; working all the
      day and sitting up at night; worn with hard living and the unaccustomed
      toil of his new life; surrounded by dismal and discouraging circumstances
      of every kind; never complained or yielded in the least degree. If ever he
      had thought Martin selfish or inconsiderate, or had deemed him energetic
      only by fits and starts, and then too passive for their desperate
      fortunes, he now forgot it all. He remembered nothing but the better
      qualities of his fellow-wanderer, and was devoted to him, heart and hand.
    </p>
    <p>
      Many weeks elapsed before Martin was strong enough to move about with the
      help of a stick and Mark&rsquo;s arm; and even then his recovery, for want of
      wholesome air and proper nourishment, was very slow. He was yet in a
      feeble and weak condition, when the misfourtune he had so much dreaded
      fell upon them. Mark was taken ill.
    </p>
    <p>
      Mark fought against it; but the malady fought harder, and his efforts were
      in vain.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Floored for the present, sir,&rsquo; he said one morning, sinking back upon his
      bed; &lsquo;but jolly!&rsquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      Floored indeed, and by a heavy blow! As any one but Martin might have
      known beforehand.
    </p>
    <p>
      If Mark&rsquo;s friends had been kind to Martin (and they had been very), they
      were twenty times kinder to Mark. And now it was Martin&rsquo;s turn to work,
      and sit beside the bed and watch, and listen through the long, long
      nights, to every sound in the gloomy wilderness; and hear poor Mr Tapley,
      in his wandering fancy, playing at skittles in the Dragon, making
      love-remonstrances to Mrs Lupin, getting his sea-legs on board the Screw,
      travelling with old Tom Pinch on English roads, and burning stumps of
      trees in Eden, all at once.
    </p>
    <p>
      But whenever Martin gave him drink or medicine, or tended him in any way,
      or came into the house returning from some drudgery without, the patient
      Mr Tapley brightened up and cried: &lsquo;I&rsquo;m jolly, sir; &lsquo;I&rsquo;m jolly!&rsquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      Now, when Martin began to think of this, and to look at Mark as he lay
      there; never reproaching him by so much as an expression of regret; never
      murmuring; always striving to be manful and staunch; he began to think,
      how was it that this man who had had so few advantages, was so much better
      than he who had had so many? And attendance upon a sick bed, but
      especially the sick bed of one whom we have been accustomed to see in full
      activity and vigour, being a great breeder of reflection, he began to ask
      himself in what they differed.
    </p>
    <p>
      He was assisted in coming to a conclusion on this head by the frequent
      presence of Mark&rsquo;s friend, their fellow-passenger across the ocean, which
      suggested to him that in regard to having aided her, for example, they had
      differed very much. Somehow he coupled Tom Pinch with this train of
      reflection; and thinking that Tom would be very likely to have struck up
      the same sort of acquaintance under similar circumstances, began to think
      in what respects two people so extremely different were like each other,
      and were unlike him. At first sight there was nothing very distressing in
      these meditations, but they did undoubtedly distress him for all that.
    </p>
    <p>
      Martin&rsquo;s nature was a frank and generous one; but he had been bred up in
      his grandfather&rsquo;s house; and it will usually be found that the meaner
      domestic vices propagate themselves to be their own antagonists.
      Selfishness does this especially; so do suspicion, cunning, stealth, and
      covetous propensities. Martin had unconsciously reasoned as a child, &lsquo;My
      guardian takes so much thought of himself, that unless I do the like by
      <i>my</i>self, I shall be forgotten.&rsquo; So he had grown selfish.
    </p>
    <p>
      But he had never known it. If any one had taxed him with the vice, he
      would have indignantly repelled the accusation, and conceived himself
      unworthily aspersed. He never would have known it, but that being newly
      risen from a bed of dangerous sickness, to watch by such another couch, he
      felt how nearly Self had dropped into the grave, and what a poor
      dependent, miserable thing it was.
    </p>
    <p>
      It was natural for him to reflect&mdash;he had months to do it in&mdash;upon
      his own escape, and Mark&rsquo;s extremity. This led him to consider which of
      them could be the better spared, and why? Then the curtain slowly rose a
      very little way; and Self, Self, Self, was shown below.
    </p>
    <p>
      He asked himself, besides, when dreading Mark&rsquo;s decease (as all men do and
      must, at such a time), whether he had done his duty by him, and had
      deserved and made a good response to his fidelity and zeal. No. Short as
      their companionship had been, he felt in many, many instances, that there
      was blame against himself; and still inquiring why, the curtain slowly
      rose a little more, and Self, Self, Self, dilated on the scene.
    </p>
    <p>
      It was long before he fixed the knowledge of himself so firmly in his mind
      that he could thoroughly discern the truth; but in the hideous solitude of
      that most hideous place, with Hope so far removed, Ambition quenched, and
      Death beside him rattling at the very door, reflection came, as in a
      plague-beleaguered town; and so he felt and knew the failing of his life,
      and saw distinctly what an ugly spot it was.
    </p>
    <p>
      Eden was a hard school to learn so hard a lesson in; but there were
      teachers in the swamp and thicket, and the pestilential air, who had a
      searching method of their own.
    </p>
    <p>
      He made a solemn resolution that when his strength returned he would not
      dispute the point or resist the conviction, but would look upon it as an
      established fact, that selfishness was in his breast, and must be rooted
      out. He was so doubtful (and with justice) of his own character, that he
      determined not to say one word of vain regret or good resolve to Mark, but
      steadily to keep his purpose before his own eyes solely; and there was not
      a jot of pride in this; nothing but humility and steadfastness; the best
      armour he could wear. So low had Eden brought him down. So high had Eden
      raised him up.
    </p>
    <p>
      After a long and lingering illness (in certain forlorn stages of which,
      when too far gone to speak, he had feebly written &lsquo;jolly!&rsquo; on a slate),
      Mark showed some symptoms of returning health. They came and went, and
      flickered for a time; but he began to mend at last decidedly; and after
      that continued to improve from day to day.
    </p>
    <p>
      As soon as he was well enough to talk without fatigue, Martin consulted
      him upon a project he had in his mind, and which a few months back he
      would have carried into execution without troubling anybody&rsquo;s head but his
      own.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Ours is a desperate case,&rsquo; said Martin. &lsquo;Plainly. The place is deserted;
      its failure must have become known; and selling what we have bought to any
      one, for anything, is hopeless, even if it were honest. We left home on a
      mad enterprise, and have failed. The only hope left us, the only one end
      for which we have now to try, is to quit this settlement for ever, and get
      back to England. Anyhow! by any means! only to get back there, Mark.&rsquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;That&rsquo;s all, sir,&rsquo; returned Mr Tapley, with a significant stress upon the
      words; &lsquo;only that!&rsquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Now, upon this side of the water,&rsquo; said Martin, &lsquo;we have but one friend
      who can help us, and that is Mr Bevan.&rsquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;I thought of him when you was ill,&rsquo; said Mark.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;But for the time that would be lost, I would even write to my
      grandfather,&rsquo; Martin went on to say, &lsquo;and implore him for money to free us
      from this trap into which we were so cruelly decoyed. Shall I try Mr Bevan
      first?&rsquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;He&rsquo;s a very pleasant sort of a gentleman,&rsquo; said Mark. &lsquo;I think so.&rsquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;The few goods we brought here, and in which we spent our money, would
      produce something if sold,&rsquo; resumed Martin; &lsquo;and whatever they realise
      shall be paid him instantly. But they can&rsquo;t be sold here.&rsquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;There&rsquo;s nobody but corpses to buy &lsquo;em,&rsquo; said Mr Tapley, shaking his head
      with a rueful air, &lsquo;and pigs.&rsquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Shall I tell him so, and only ask him for money enough to enable us by
      the cheapest means to reach New York, or any port from which we may hope
      to get a passage home, by serving in any capacity? Explaining to him at
      the same time how I am connected, and that I will endeavour to repay him,
      even through my grandfather, immediately on our arrival in England?&rsquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Why to be sure,&rsquo; said Mark: &lsquo;he can only say no, and he may say yes. If
      you don&rsquo;t mind trying him, sir&mdash;&rsquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Mind!&rsquo; exclaimed Martin. &lsquo;I am to blame for coming here, and I would do
      anything to get away. I grieve to think of the past. If I had taken your
      opinion sooner, Mark, we never should have been here, I am certain.&rsquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      Mr Tapley was very much surprised at this admission, but protested, with
      great vehemence, that they would have been there all the same; and that he
      had set his heart upon coming to Eden, from the first word he had ever
      heard of it.
    </p>
    <p>
      Martin then read him a letter to Mr Bevan, which he had already prepared.
      It was frankly and ingenuously written, and described their situation
      without the least concealment; plainly stated the miseries they had
      undergone; and preferred their request in modest but straightforward
      terms. Mark highly commended it; and they determined to dispatch it by the
      next steamboat going the right way, that might call to take in wood at
      Eden&mdash;where there was plenty of wood to spare. Not knowing how to
      address Mr Bevan at his own place of abode, Martin superscribed it to the
      care of the memorable Mr Norris of New York, and wrote upon the cover an
      entreaty that it might be forwarded without delay.
    </p>
    <p>
      More than a week elapsed before a boat appeared; but at length they were
      awakened very early one morning by the high-pressure snorting of the &lsquo;Esau
      Slodge;&rsquo; named after one of the most remarkable men in the country, who
      had been very eminent somewhere. Hurrying down to the landing-place, they
      got it safe on board; and waiting anxiously to see the boat depart,
      stopped up the gangway; an instance of neglect which caused the &lsquo;Capting&rsquo;
      of the Esau Slodge to &lsquo;wish he might be sifted fine as flour, and whittled
      small as chips; that if they didn&rsquo;t come off that there fixing right smart
      too, he&rsquo;d spill &lsquo;em in the drink;&rsquo; whereby the Capting metaphorically said
      he&rsquo;d throw them in the river.
    </p>
    <p>
      They were not likely to receive an answer for eight or ten weeks at the
      earliest. In the meantime they devoted such strength as they had to the
      attempted improvement of their land; to clearing some of it, and preparing
      it for useful purposes. Monstrously defective as their farming was, still
      it was better than their neighbours&rsquo;; for Mark had some practical
      knowledge of such matters, and Martin learned of him; whereas the other
      settlers who remained upon the putrid swamp (a mere handful, and those
      withered by disease), appeared to have wandered there with the idea that
      husbandry was the natural gift of all mankind. They helped each other
      after their own manner in these struggles, and in all others; but they
      worked as hopelessly and sadly as a gang of convicts in a penal
      settlement.
    </p>
    <p>
      Often at night when Mark and Martin were alone, and lying down to sleep,
      they spoke of home, familiar places, houses, roads, and people whom they
      knew; sometimes in the lively hope of seeing them again, and sometimes
      with a sorrowful tranquillity, as if that hope were dead. It was a source
      of great amazement to Mark Tapley to find, pervading all these
      conversations, a singular alteration in Martin.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;I don&rsquo;t know what to make of him,&rsquo; he thought one night, &lsquo;he ain&rsquo;t what I
      supposed. He don&rsquo;t think of himself half as much. I&rsquo;ll try him again.
      Asleep, sir?&rsquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;No, Mark.&rsquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Thinking of home, sir?&rsquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Yes, Mark.&rsquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;So was I, sir. I was wondering how Mr Pinch and Mr Pecksniff gets on
      now.&rsquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Poor Tom!&rsquo; said Martin, thoughtfully.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Weak-minded man, sir,&rsquo; observed Mr Tapley. &lsquo;Plays the organ for nothing,
      sir. Takes no care of himself?&rsquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;I wish he took a little more, indeed,&rsquo; said Martin. &lsquo;Though I don&rsquo;t know
      why I should. We shouldn&rsquo;t like him half as well, perhaps.&rsquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;He gets put upon, sir,&rsquo; hinted Mark.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Yes!&rsquo; said Martin, after a short silence. &lsquo;I know that, Mark.&rsquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      He spoke so regretfully that his partner abandoned the theme, and was
      silent for a short time until he had thought of another.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Ah, sir!&rsquo; said Mark, with a sigh. &lsquo;Dear me! You&rsquo;ve ventured a good deal
      for a young lady&rsquo;s love!&rsquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;I tell you what. I&rsquo;m not so sure of that, Mark,&rsquo; was the reply; so
      hastily and energetically spoken, that Martin sat up in his bed to give
      it. &lsquo;I begin to be far from clear upon it. You may depend upon it she is
      very unhappy. She has sacrificed her peace of mind; she has endangered her
      interests very much; she can&rsquo;t run away from those who are jealous of her,
      and opposed to her, as I have done. She has to endure, Mark; to endure
      without the possibility of action, poor girl! I begin to think that she
      has more to bear than ever I had. Upon my soul I do!&rsquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      Mr Tapley opened his eyes wide in the dark; but did not interrupt.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;And I&rsquo;ll tell you a secret, Mark,&rsquo; said Martin, &lsquo;since we <i>are </i>upon this
      subject. That ring&mdash;&rsquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Which ring, sir?&rsquo; Mark inquired, opening his eyes still wider.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;That ring she gave me when we parted, Mark. She bought it; bought it;
      knowing I was poor and proud (Heaven help me! Proud!) and wanted money.&rsquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Who says so, sir?&rsquo; asked Mark.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;I say so. I know it. I thought of it, my good fellow, hundreds of times,
      while you were lying ill. And like a beast, I took it from her hand, and
      wore it on my own, and never dreamed of this even at the moment when I
      parted with it, when some faint glimmering of the truth might surely have
      possessed me! But it&rsquo;s late,&rsquo; said Martin, checking himself, &lsquo;and you are
      weak and tired, I know. You only talk to cheer me up. Good night! God
      bless you, Mark!&rsquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;God bless you, sir! But I&rsquo;m reg&rsquo;larly defrauded,&rsquo; thought Mr Tapley,
      turning round with a happy face. &lsquo;It&rsquo;s a swindle. I never entered for this
      sort of service. There&rsquo;ll be no credit in being jolly with <i>him</i>!&rsquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      The time wore on, and other steamboats coming from the point on which
      their hopes were fixed, arrived to take in wood; but still no answer to
      the letter. Rain, heat, foul slime, and noxious vapour, with all the ills
      and filthy things they bred, prevailed. The earth, the air, the
      vegetation, and the water that they drank, all teemed with deadly
      properties. Their fellow-passenger had lost two children long before; and
      buried now her last. Such things are much too common to be widely known or
      cared for. Smart citizens grow rich, and friendless victims smart and die,
      and are forgotten. That is all.
    </p>
    <p>
      At last a boat came panting up the ugly river, and stopped at Eden. Mark
      was waiting at the wood hut when it came, and had a letter handed to him
      from on board. He bore it off to Martin. They looked at one another,
      trembling.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;It feels heavy,&rsquo; faltered Martin. And opening it a little roll of
      dollar-notes fell out upon the ground.
    </p>
    <p>
      What either of them said, or did, or felt, at first, neither of them knew.
      All Mark could ever tell was, that he was at the river&rsquo;s bank again out of
      breath, before the boat had gone, inquiring when it would retrace its
      track and put in there.
    </p>
    <p>
      The answer was, in ten or twelve days; notwithstanding which they began to
      get their goods together and to tie them up that very night. When this
      stage of excitement was passed, each of them believed (they found this
      out, in talking of it afterwards) that he would surely die before the boat
      returned.
    </p>
    <p>
      They lived, however, and it came, after the lapse of three long crawling
      weeks. At sunrise, on an autumn day, they stood upon her deck.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Courage! We shall meet again!&rsquo; cried Martin, waving his hand to two thin
      figures on the bank. &lsquo;In the Old World!&rsquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Or in the next one,&rsquo; added Mark below his breath. &lsquo;To see them standing
      side by side, so quiet, is a&rsquo;most the worst of all!&rsquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      They looked at one another as the vessel moved away, and then looked
      backward at the spot from which it hurried fast. The log-house, with the
      open door, and drooping trees about it; the stagnant morning mist, and red
      sun, dimly seen beyond; the vapour rising up from land and river; the
      quick stream making the loathsome banks it washed more flat and dull; how
      often they returned in dreams! How often it was happiness to wake and find
      them Shadows that had vanished!

    <h2>
      CHAPTER THIRTY-FOUR
    </h2>
    <p>
      IN WHICH THE TRAVELLERS MOVE HOMEWARD, AND ENCOUNTER SOME DISTINGUISHED
      CHARACTERS UPON THE WAY
    </p>
    <p>
      Among the passengers on board the steamboat, there was a faint gentleman
      sitting on a low camp-stool, with his legs on a high barrel of flour, as
      if he were looking at the prospect with his ankles, who attracted their
      attention speedily.
    </p>
    <p>
      He had straight black hair, parted up the middle of his head and hanging
      down upon his coat; a little fringe of hair upon his chin; wore no
      neckcloth; a white hat; a suit of black, long in the sleeves and short in
      the legs; soiled brown stockings and laced shoes. His complexion,
      naturally muddy, was rendered muddier by too strict an economy of soap and
      water; and the same observation will apply to the washable part of his
      attire, which he might have changed with comfort to himself and
      gratification to his friends. He was about five and thirty; was crushed
      and jammed up in a heap, under the shade of a large green cotton umbrella;
      and ruminated over his tobacco-plug like a cow.
    </p>
    <p>
      He was not singular, to be sure, in these respects; for every gentleman on
      board appeared to have had a difference with his laundress and to have
      left off washing himself in early youth. Every gentleman, too, was
      perfectly stopped up with tight plugging, and was dislocated in the
      greater part of his joints. But about this gentleman there was a peculiar
      air of sagacity and wisdom, which convinced Martin that he was no common
      character; and this turned out to be the case.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;How do you do sir?&rsquo; said a voice in Martin&rsquo;s ear
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;How do you do sir?&rsquo; said Martin.
    </p>
    <p>
      It was a tall thin gentleman who spoke to him, with a carpet-cap on, and a
      long loose coat of green baize, ornamented about the pockets with black
      velvet.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;You air from Europe, sir?&rsquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;I am,&rsquo; said Martin.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;You air fortunate, sir.&rsquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      Martin thought so too; but he soon discovered that the gentleman and he
      attached different meanings to this remark.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;You air fortunate, sir, in having an opportunity of beholding our Elijah
      Pogram, sir.&rsquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Your Elijahpogram!&rsquo; said Martin, thinking it was all one word, and a
      building of some sort.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Yes sir.&rsquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      Martin tried to look as if he understood him, but he couldn&rsquo;t make it out.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Yes, sir,&rsquo; repeated the gentleman, &lsquo;our Elijah Pogram, sir, is, at this
      minute, identically settin&rsquo; by the engine biler.&rsquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      The gentleman under the umbrella put his right forefinger to his eyebrow,
      as if he were revolving schemes of state.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;That is Elijah Pogram, is it?&rsquo; said Martin.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Yes, sir,&rsquo; replied the other. &lsquo;That is Elijah Pogram.&rsquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Dear me!&rsquo; said Martin. &lsquo;I am astonished.&rsquo; But he had not the least idea
      who this Elijah Pogram was; having never heard the name in all his life.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;If the biler of this vessel was Toe bust, sir,&rsquo; said his new
      acquaintance, &lsquo;and Toe bust now, this would be a festival day in the
      calendar of despotism; pretty nigh equallin&rsquo;, sir, in its effects upon the
      human race, our Fourth of glorious July. Yes, sir, that is the Honourable
      Elijah Pogram, Member of Congress; one of the master-minds of our country,
      sir. There is a brow, sir, there!&rsquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Quite remarkable,&rsquo; said Martin.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Yes, sir. Our own immortal Chiggle, sir, is said to have observed, when
      he made the celebrated Pogram statter in marble, which rose so much
      con-test and preju-dice in Europe, that the brow was more than mortal.
      This was before the Pogram Defiance, and was, therefore, a pre-diction,
      cruel smart.&rsquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;What is the Pogram Defiance?&rsquo; asked Martin, thinking, perhaps, it was the
      sign of a public-house.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;An o-ration, sir,&rsquo; returned his friend.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Oh! to be sure,&rsquo; cried Martin. &lsquo;What am I thinking of! It defied&mdash;&rsquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;It defied the world, sir,&rsquo; said the other, gravely. &lsquo;Defied the world in
      general to com-pete with our country upon any hook; and devellop&rsquo;d our
      internal resources for making war upon the universal airth. You would like
      to know Elijah Pogram, sir?&rsquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;If you please,&rsquo; said Martin.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Mr Pogram,&rsquo; said the stranger&mdash;Mr Pogram having overheard every word
      of the dialogue&mdash;&lsquo;this is a gentleman from Europe, sir; from England,
      sir. But gen&rsquo;rous ene-mies may meet upon the neutral sile of private life,
      I think.&rsquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      The languid Mr Pogram shook hands with Martin, like a clock-work figure
      that was just running down. But he made amends by chewing like one that
      was just wound up.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Mr Pogram,&rsquo; said the introducer, &lsquo;is a public servant, sir. When Congress
      is recessed, he makes himself acquainted with those free United States, of
      which he is the gifted son.&rsquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      It occurred to Martin that if the Honourable Elijah Pogram had stayed at
      home, and sent his shoes upon a tour, they would have answered the same
      purpose; for they were the only part of him in a situation to see
      anything.
    </p>
    <p>
      In course of time, however, Mr Pogram rose; and having ejected certain
      plugging consequences which would have impeded his articulation, took up a
      position where there was something to lean against, and began to talk to
      Martin; shading himself with the green umbrella all the time.
    </p>
    <p>
      As he began with the words, &lsquo;How do you like&mdash;?&rsquo; Martin took him up
      and said:
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;The country, I presume?&rsquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Yes, sir,&rsquo; said Elijah Pogram. A knot of passengers gathered round to
      hear what followed; and Martin heard his friend say, as he whispered to
      another friend, and rubbed his hands, &lsquo;Pogram will smash him into sky-blue
      fits, I know!&rsquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Why,&rsquo; said Martin, after a moment&rsquo;s hesitation, &lsquo;I have learned by
      experience, that you take an unfair advantage of a stranger, when you ask
      that question. You don&rsquo;t mean it to be answered, except in one way. Now, I
      don&rsquo;t choose to answer it in that way, for I cannot honestly answer it in
      that way. And therefore, I would rather not answer it at all.&rsquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      But Mr Pogram was going to make a great speech in the next session about
      foreign relations, and was going to write strong articles on the subject;
      and as he greatly favoured the free and independent custom (a very
      harmless and agreeable one) of procuring information of any sort in any
      kind of confidence, and afterwards perverting it publicly in any manner
      that happened to suit him, he had determined to get at Martin&rsquo;s opinions
      somehow or other. For if he could have got nothing out of him, he would
      have had to invent it for him, and that would have been laborious. He made
      a mental note of his answer, and went in again.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;You are from Eden, sir? How did you like Eden?&rsquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      Martin said what he thought of that part of the country, in pretty strong
      terms.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;It is strange,&rsquo; said Pogram, looking round upon the group, &lsquo;this hatred
      of our country, and her Institutions! This national antipathy is deeply
      rooted in the British mind!&rsquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Good Heaven, sir,&rsquo; cried Martin. &lsquo;Is the Eden Land Corporation, with Mr
      Scadder at its head, and all the misery it has worked, at its door, an
      Institution of America? A part of any form of government that ever was
      known or heard of?&rsquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;I con-sider the cause of this to be,&rsquo; said Pogram, looking round again
      and taking himself up where Martin had interrupted him, &lsquo;partly jealousy
      and pre-judice, and partly the nat&rsquo;ral unfitness of the British people to
      appreciate the ex-alted Institutions of our native land. I expect, sir,&rsquo;
      turning to Martin again, &lsquo;that a gentleman named Chollop happened in upon
      you during your lo-cation in the town of Eden?&rsquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Yes,&rsquo; answered Martin; &lsquo;but my friend can answer this better than I can,
      for I was very ill at the time. Mark! The gentleman is speaking of Mr
      Chollop.&rsquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Oh. Yes, sir. Yes. I see him,&rsquo; observed Mark.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;A splendid example of our na-tive raw material, sir?&rsquo; said Pogram,
      interrogatively.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Indeed, sir!&rsquo; cried Mark.
    </p>
    <p>
      The Honourable Elijah Pogram glanced at his friends as though he would
      have said, &lsquo;Observe this! See what follows!&rsquo; and they rendered tribute to
      the Pogram genius by a gentle murmur.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Our fellow-countryman is a model of a man, quite fresh from Natur&rsquo;s
      mould!&rsquo; said Pogram, with enthusiasm. &lsquo;He is a true-born child of this
      free hemisphere! Verdant as the mountains of our country; bright and
      flowing as our mineral Licks; unspiled by withering conventionalities as
      air our broad and boundless Perearers! Rough he may be. So air our Barrs.
      Wild he may be. So air our Buffalers. But he is a child of Natur&rsquo;, and a
      child of Freedom; and his boastful answer to the Despot and the Tyrant is,
      that his bright home is in the Settin Sun.&rsquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      Part of this referred to Chollop, and part to a Western postmaster, who,
      being a public defaulter not very long before (a character not at all
      uncommon in America), had been removed from office; and on whose behalf Mr
      Pogram (he voted for Pogram) had thundered the last sentence from his seat
      in Congress, at the head of an unpopular President. It told brilliantly;
      for the bystanders were delighted, and one of them said to Martin, &lsquo;that
      he guessed he had now seen something of the eloquential aspect of our
      country, and was chawed up pritty small.&rsquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      Mr Pogram waited until his hearers were calm again, before he said to
      Mark:
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;You do not seem to coincide, sir?&rsquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Why,&rsquo; said Mark, &lsquo;I didn&rsquo;t like him much; and that&rsquo;s the truth, sir. I
      thought he was a bully; and I didn&rsquo;t admire his carryin&rsquo; them murderous
      little persuaders, and being so ready to use &lsquo;em.&rsquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;It&rsquo;s singler!&rsquo; said Pogram, lifting his umbrella high enough to look all
      round from under it. &lsquo;It&rsquo;s strange! You observe the settled opposition to
      our Institutions which pervades the British mind!&rsquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;What an extraordinary people you are!&rsquo; cried Martin. &lsquo;Are Mr Chollop and
      the class he represents, an Institution here? Are pistols with revolving
      barrels, sword-sticks, bowie-knives, and such things, Institutions on
      which you pride yourselves? Are bloody duels, brutal combats, savage
      assaults, shooting down and stabbing in the streets, your Institutions!
      Why, I shall hear next that Dishonour and Fraud are among the Institutions
      of the great republic!&rsquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      The moment the words passed his lips, the Honourable Elijah Pogram looked
      round again.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;This morbid hatred of our Institutions,&rsquo; he observed, &lsquo;is quite a study
      for the psychological observer. He&rsquo;s alludin&rsquo; to Repudiation now!&rsquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Oh! you may make anything an Institution if you like,&rsquo; said Martin,
      laughing, &lsquo;and I confess you had me there, for you certainly have made
      that one. But the greater part of these things are one Institution with
      us, and we call it by the generic name of Old Bailey!&rsquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      The bell being rung for dinner at this moment, everybody ran away into the
      cabin, whither the Honourable Elijah Pogram fled with such precipitation
      that he forgot his umbrella was up, and fixed it so tightly in the cabin
      door that it could neither be let down nor got out. For a minute or so
      this accident created a perfect rebellion among the hungry passengers
      behind, who, seeing the dishes, and hearing the knives and forks at work,
      well knew what would happen unless they got there instantly, and were
      nearly mad; while several virtuous citizens at the table were in deadly
      peril of choking themselves in their unnatural efforts to get rid of all
      the meat before these others came.
    </p>
    <p>
      They carried the umbrella by storm, however, and rushed in at the breach.
      The Honourable Elijah Pogram and Martin found themselves, after a severe
      struggle, side by side, as they might have come together in the pit of a
      London theatre; and for four whole minutes afterwards, Pogram was snapping
      up great blocks of everything he could get hold of, like a raven. When he
      had taken this unusually protracted dinner, he began to talk to Martin;
      and begged him not to have the least delicacy in speaking with perfect
      freedom to him, for he was a calm philosopher. Which Martin was extremely
      glad to hear; for he had begun to speculate on Elijah being a disciple of
      that other school of republican philosophy, whose noble sentiments are
      carved with knives upon a pupil&rsquo;s body, and written, not with pen and ink,
      but tar and feathers.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;What do you think of my countrymen who are present, sir?&rsquo; inquired Elijah
      Pogram.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Oh! very pleasant,&rsquo; said Martin.
    </p>
    <p>
      They were a very pleasant party. No man had spoken a word; every one had
      been intent, as usual, on his own private gorging; and the greater part of
      the company were decidedly dirty feeders.
    </p>
    <p>
      The Honourable Elijah Pogram looked at Martin as if he thought &lsquo;You don&rsquo;t
      mean that, I know!&rsquo; and he was soon confirmed in this opinion.
    </p>
    <p>
      Sitting opposite to them was a gentleman in a high state of tobacco, who
      wore quite a little beard, composed of the overflowing of that weed, as
      they had dried about his mouth and chin; so common an ornament that it
      would scarcely have attracted Martin&rsquo;s observation, but that this good
      citizen, burning to assert his equality against all comers, sucked his
      knife for some moments, and made a cut with it at the butter, just as
      Martin was in the act of taking some. There was a juiciness about the deed
      that might have sickened a scavenger.
    </p>
    <p>
      When Elijah Pogram (to whom this was an every-day incident) saw that
      Martin put the plate away, and took no butter, he was quite delighted, and
      said,
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Well! The morbid hatred of you British to the Institutions of our country
      is as-<i>ton</i>ishing!&rsquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Upon my life!&rsquo; cried Martin, in his turn. &lsquo;This is the most wonderful
      community that ever existed. A man deliberately makes a hog of himself,
      and <i>that&rsquo;s</i> an Institution!&rsquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;We have no time to ac-quire forms, sir,&rsquo; said Elijah Pogram.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Acquire!&rsquo; cried Martin. &lsquo;But it&rsquo;s not a question of acquiring anything.
      It&rsquo;s a question of losing the natural politeness of a savage, and that
      instinctive good breeding which admonishes one man not to offend and
      disgust another. Don&rsquo;t you think that man over the way, for instance,
      naturally knows better, but considers it a very fine and independent thing
      to be a brute in small matters?&rsquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;He is a na-tive of our country, and is nat&rsquo;rally bright and spry, of
      course,&rsquo; said Mr Pogram.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Now, observe what this comes to, Mr Pogram,&rsquo; pursued Martin. &lsquo;The mass of
      your countrymen begin by stubbornly neglecting little social observances,
      which have nothing to do with gentility, custom, usage, government, or
      country, but are acts of common, decent, natural, human politeness. You
      abet them in this, by resenting all attacks upon their social offences as
      if they were a beautiful national feature. From disregarding small
      obligations they come in regular course to disregard great ones; and so
      refuse to pay their debts. What they may do, or what they may refuse to do
      next, I don&rsquo;t know; but any man may see if he will, that it will be
      something following in natural succession, and a part of one great growth,
      which is rotten at the root.&rsquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      The mind of Mr Pogram was too philosophical to see this; so they went on
      deck again, where, resuming his former post, he chewed until he was in a
      lethargic state, amounting to insensibility.
    </p>
    <p>
      After a weary voyage of several days, they came again to that same wharf
      where Mark had been so nearly left behind, on the night of starting for
      Eden. Captain Kedgick, the landlord, was standing there, and was greatly
      surprised to see them coming from the boat.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Why, what the &lsquo;tarnal!&rsquo; cried the Captain. &lsquo;Well! I do admire at this, I
      do!&rsquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;We can stay at your house until to-morrow, Captain, I suppose?&rsquo; said
      Martin.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;I reckon you can stay there for a twelvemonth if you like,&rsquo; retorted
      Kedgick coolly. &lsquo;But our people won&rsquo;t best like your coming back.&rsquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Won&rsquo;t like it, Captain Kedgick!&rsquo; said Martin.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;They did expect you was a-going to settle,&rsquo; Kedgick answered, as he shook
      his head. &lsquo;They&rsquo;ve been took in, you can&rsquo;t deny!&rsquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;What do you mean?&rsquo; cried Martin.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;You didn&rsquo;t ought to have received &lsquo;em,&rsquo; said the Captain. &lsquo;No you
      didn&rsquo;t!&rsquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;My good friend,&rsquo; returned Martin, &lsquo;did I want to receive them? Was it any
      act of mine? Didn&rsquo;t you tell me they would rile up, and that I should be
      flayed like a wild cat&mdash;and threaten all kinds of vengeance, if I
      didn&rsquo;t receive them?&rsquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;I don&rsquo;t know about that,&rsquo; returned the Captain. &lsquo;But when our people&rsquo;s
      frills is out, they&rsquo;re starched up pretty stiff, I tell you!&rsquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      With that, he fell into the rear to walk with Mark, while Martin and
      Elijah Pogram went on to the National.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;We&rsquo;ve come back alive, you see!&rsquo; said Mark.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;It ain&rsquo;t the thing I did expect,&rsquo; the Captain grumbled. &lsquo;A man ain&rsquo;t got
      no right to be a public man, unless he meets the public views. Our
      fashionable people wouldn&rsquo;t have attended his le-vee, if they had know&rsquo;d
      it.&rsquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      Nothing mollified the Captain, who persisted in taking it very ill that
      they had not both died in Eden. The boarders at the National felt strongly
      on the subject too; but it happened by good fortune that they had not much
      time to think about this grievance, for it was suddenly determined to
      pounce upon the Honourable Elijah Pogram, and give <i>him </i>a le-vee forthwith.
    </p>
    <p>
      As the general evening meal of the house was over before the arrival of
      the boat, Martin, Mark, and Pogram were taking tea and fixings at the
      public table by themselves, when the deputation entered to announce this
      honour; consisting of six gentlemen boarders and a very shrill boy.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Sir!&rsquo; said the spokesman.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Mr Pogram!&rsquo; cried the shrill boy.
    </p>
    <p>
      The spokesman thus reminded of the shrill boy&rsquo;s presence, introduced him.
      &lsquo;Doctor Ginery Dunkle, sir. A gentleman of great poetical elements. He has
      recently jined us here, sir, and is an acquisition to us, sir, I do assure
      you. Yes, sir. Mr Jodd, sir. Mr Izzard, sir. Mr Julius Bib, sir.&rsquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Julius Washington Merryweather Bib,&rsquo; said the gentleman himself <i>to</i>
      himself.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;I beg your pardon, sir. Excuse me. Mr Julius Washington Merryweather Bib,
      sir; a gentleman in the lumber line, sir, and much esteemed. Colonel
      Groper, sir. Pro-fessor Piper, sir. My own name, sir, is Oscar Buffum.&rsquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      Each man took one slide forward as he was named; butted at the Honourable
      Elijah Pogram with his head; shook hands, and slid back again. The
      introductions being completed, the spokesman resumed.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Sir!&rsquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Mr Pogram!&rsquo; cried the shrill boy.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Perhaps,&rsquo; said the spokesman, with a hopeless look, &lsquo;you will be so good,
      Dr. Ginery Dunkle, as to charge yourself with the execution of our little
      office, sir?&rsquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      As there was nothing the shrill boy desired more, he immediately stepped
      forward.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Mr Pogram! Sir! A handful of your fellow-citizens, sir, hearing of your
      arrival at the National Hotel, and feeling the patriotic character of your
      public services, wish, sir, to have the gratification of beholding you,
      and mixing with you, sir; and unbending with you, sir, in those moments
      which&mdash;&rsquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Air,&rsquo; suggested Buffum.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Which air so peculiarly the lot, sir, of our great and happy country.&rsquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Hear!&rsquo; cried Colonel Grouper, in a loud voice. &lsquo;Good! Hear him! Good!&rsquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;And therefore, sir,&rsquo; pursued the Doctor, &lsquo;they request; as A mark Of
      their respect; the honour of your company at a little le-Vee, sir, in the
      ladies&rsquo; ordinary, at eight o&rsquo;clock.&rsquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      Mr Pogram bowed, and said:
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Fellow countrymen!&rsquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Good!&rsquo; cried the Colonel. &lsquo;Hear, him! Good!&rsquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      Mr Pogram bowed to the Colonel individually, and then resumed.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Your approbation of My labours in the common cause goes to My heart. At
      all times and in all places; in the ladies&rsquo; ordinary, My friends, and in
      the Battle Field&mdash;&rsquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Good, very good! Hear him! Hear him!&rsquo; said the Colonel.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;The name of Pogram will be proud to jine you. And may it, My friends, be
      written on My tomb, &ldquo;He was a member of the Congress of our common
      country, and was ac-Tive in his trust.&rdquo;&rsquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;The Com-mittee, sir,&rsquo; said the shrill boy, &lsquo;will wait upon you at five
      minutes afore eight. I take My leave, sir!&rsquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      Mr Pogram shook hands with him, and everybody else, once more; and when
      they came back again at five minutes before eight, they said, one by one,
      in a melancholy voice, &lsquo;How do you do, sir?&rsquo; and shook hands with Mr
      Pogram all over again, as if he had been abroad for a twelvemonth in the
      meantime, and they met, now, at a funeral.
    </p>
    <p>
      But by this time Mr Pogram had freshened himself up, and had composed his
      hair and features after the Pogram statue, so that any one with half an
      eye might cry out, &lsquo;There he is! as he delivered the Defiance!&rsquo; The
      Committee were embellished also; and when they entered the ladies&rsquo;
      ordinary in a body, there was much clapping of hands from ladies and
      gentlemen, accompanied by cries of &lsquo;Pogram! Pogram!&rsquo; and some standing up
      on chairs to see him.
    </p>
    <p>
      The object of the popular caress looked round the room as he walked up it,
      and smiled; at the same time observing to the shrill boy, that he knew
      something of the beauty of the daughters of their common country, but had
      never seen it in such lustre and perfection as at that moment. Which the
      shrill boy put in the paper next day; to Elijah Pogram&rsquo;s great surprise.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;We will re-quest you, sir, if you please,&rsquo; said Buffum, laying hands on
      Mr Pogram as if he were taking his measure for a coat, &lsquo;to stand up with
      your back agin the wall right in the furthest corner, that there may be
      more room for our fellow citizens. If you could set your back right slap
      agin that curtain-peg, sir, keeping your left leg everlastingly behind the
      stove, we should be fixed quite slick.&rsquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      Mr Pogram did as he was told, and wedged himself into such a little corner
      that the Pogram statue wouldn&rsquo;t have known him.
    </p>
    <p>
      The entertainments of the evening then began. Gentlemen brought ladies up,
      and brought themselves up, and brought each other up; and asked Elijah
      Pogram what he thought of this political question, and what he thought of
      that; and looked at him, and looked at one another, and seemed very
      unhappy indeed. The ladies on the chairs looked at Elijah Pogram through
      their glasses, and said audibly, &lsquo;I wish he&rsquo;d speak. Why don&rsquo;t he speak?
      Oh, do ask him to speak!&rsquo; And Elijah Pogram looked sometimes at the ladies
      and sometimes elsewhere, delivering senatorial opinions, as he was asked
      for them. But the great end and object of the meeting seemed to be, not to
      let Elijah Pogram out of the corner on any account; so there they kept
      him, hard and fast.
    </p>
    <p>
      A great bustle at the door, in the course of the evening, announced the
      arrival of some remarkable person; and immediately afterwards an elderly
      gentleman, much excited, was seen to precipitate himself upon the crowd,
      and battle his way towards the Honourable Elijah Pogram. Martin, who had
      found a snug place of observation in a distant corner, where he stood with
      Mark beside him (for he did not so often forget him now as formerly,
      though he still did sometimes), thought he knew this gentleman, but had no
      doubt of it, when he cried as loud as he could, with his eyes starting out
      of his head:
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Sir, Mrs Hominy!&rsquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Lord bless that woman, Mark. She has turned up again!&rsquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Here she comes, sir,&rsquo; answered Mr Tapley. &lsquo;Pogram knows her. A public
      character! Always got her eye upon her country, sir! If that there lady&rsquo;s
      husband is of my opinion, what a jolly old gentleman he must be!&rsquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      A lane was made; and Mrs Hominy, with the aristocratic stalk, the pocket
      handkerchief, the clasped hands, and the classical cap, came slowly up it,
      in a procession of one. Mr Pogram testified emotions of delight on seeing
      her, and a general hush prevailed. For it was known that when a woman like
      Mrs Hominy encountered a man like Pogram, something interesting must be
      said.
    </p>
    <p>
      Their first salutations were exchanged in a voice too low to reach the
      impatient ears of the throng; but they soon became audible, for Mrs Hominy
      felt her position, and knew what was expected of her.
    </p>
    <p>
      Mrs H. was hard upon him at first; and put him through a rigid catechism
      in reference to a certain vote he had given, which she had found it
      necessary, as the mother of the modern Gracchi, to deprecate in a line by
      itself, set up expressly for the purpose in German text. But Mr Pogram
      evading it by a well-timed allusion to the star-spangled banner, which, it
      appeared, had the remarkable peculiarity of flouting the breeze whenever
      it was hoisted where the wind blew, she forgave him. They now enlarged on
      certain questions of tariff, commercial treaty, boundary, importation and
      exportation with great effect. And Mrs Hominy not only talked, as the
      saying is, like a book, but actually did talk her own books, word for
      word.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;My! what is this!&rsquo; cried Mrs Hominy, opening a little note which was
      handed her by her excited gentleman-usher. &lsquo;Do tell! oh, well, now! on&rsquo;y
      think!&rsquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      And then she read aloud, as follows:
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Two literary ladies present their compliments to the mother of the modern
      Gracchi, and claim her kind introduction, as their talented countrywoman,
      to the honourable (and distinguished) Elijah Pogram, whom the two L. L.&lsquo;s
      have often contemplated in the speaking marble of the soul-subduing
      Chiggle. On a verbal intimation from the mother of the M. G., that she
      will comply with the request of the two L. L.&lsquo;s, they will have the
      immediate pleasure of joining the galaxy assembled to do honour to the
      patriotic conduct of a Pogram. It may be another bond of union between the
      two L. L.&lsquo;s and the mother of the M. G. to observe, that the two L. L.&lsquo;s
      are Transcendental.&rsquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      Mrs Hominy promptly rose, and proceeded to the door, whence she returned,
      after a minute&rsquo;s interval, with the two L. L.&lsquo;s, whom she led, through the
      lane in the crowd, with all that stateliness of deportment which was so
      remarkably her own, up to the great Elijah Pogram. It was (as the shrill
      boy cried out in an ecstasy) quite the Last Scene from Coriolanus. One of
      the L. L.&lsquo;s wore a brown wig of uncommon size. Sticking on the forehead of
      the other, by invisible means, was a massive cameo, in size and shape like
      the raspberry tart which is ordinarily sold for a penny, representing on
      its front the Capitol at Washington.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Miss Toppit, and Miss Codger!&rsquo; said Mrs Hominy.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Codger&rsquo;s the lady so often mentioned in the English newspapers I should
      think, sir,&rsquo; whispered Mark. &lsquo;The oldest inhabitant as never remembers
      anything.&rsquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;To be presented to a Pogram,&rsquo; said Miss Codger, &lsquo;by a Hominy, indeed, a
      thrilling moment is it in its impressiveness on what we call our feelings.
      But why we call them so, or why impressed they are, or if impressed they
      are at all, or if at all we are, or if there really is, oh gasping one! a
      Pogram or a Hominy, or any active principle to which we give those titles,
      is a topic, Spirit searching, light abandoned, much too vast to enter on,
      at this unlooked-for crisis.&rsquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Mind and matter,&rsquo; said the lady in the wig, &lsquo;glide swift into the vortex
      of immensity. Howls the sublime, and softly sleeps the calm Ideal, in the
      whispering chambers of Imagination. To hear it, sweet it is. But then,
      outlaughs the stern philosopher, and saith to the Grotesque, &ldquo;What ho!
      arrest for me that Agency. Go, bring it here!&rdquo; And so the vision fadeth.&rsquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      After this, they both took Mr Pogram by the hand, and pressed it to their
      lips, as a patriotic palm. That homage paid, the mother of the modern
      Gracchi called for chairs, and the three literary ladies went to work in
      earnest, to bring poor Pogram out, and make him show himself in all his
      brilliant colours.
    </p>
    <p>
      How Pogram got out of his depth instantly, and how the three L. L.&lsquo;s were
      never in theirs, is a piece of history not worth recording. Suffice it,
      that being all four out of their depths, and all unable to swim, they
      splashed up words in all directions, and floundered about famously. On the
      whole, it was considered to have been the severest mental exercise ever
      heard in the National Hotel. Tears stood in the shrill boy&rsquo;s eyes several
      times; and the whole company observed that their heads ached with the
      effort&mdash;as well they might.
    </p>
    <p>
      When it at last became necessary to release Elijah Pogram from the corner,
      and the Committee saw him safely back again to the next room, they were
      fervent in their admiration.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Which,&rsquo; said Mr Buffum, &lsquo;must have vent, or it will bust. Toe you, Mr
      Pogram, I am grateful. Toe-wards you, sir, I am inspired with lofty
      veneration, and with deep e-mo-tion. The sentiment Toe which I would
      propose to give ex-pression, sir, is this: &ldquo;May you ever be as firm, sir,
      as your marble statter! May it ever be as great a terror Toe its ene-mies
      as you.&rdquo;&rsquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      There is some reason to suppose that it was rather terrible to its
      friends; being a statue of the Elevated or Goblin School, in which the
      Honourable Elijah Pogram was represented as in a very high wind, with his
      hair all standing on end, and his nostrils blown wide open. But Mr Pogram
      thanked his friend and countryman for the aspiration to which he had given
      utterance, and the Committee, after another solemn shaking of hands,
      retired to bed, except the Doctor; who immediately repaired to the
      newspaper-office, and there wrote a short poem suggested by the events of
      the evening, beginning with fourteen stars, and headed, &lsquo;A Fragment.
      Suggested by witnessing the Honourable Elijah Pogram engaged in a
      philosophical disputation with three of Columbia&rsquo;s fairest daughters. By
      Doctor Ginery Dunkle. Of Troy.&rsquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      If Pogram was as glad to get to bed as Martin was, he must have been well
      rewarded for his labours. They started off again next day (Martin and Mark
      previously disposing of their goods to the storekeepers of whom they had
      purchased them, for anything they would bring), and were fellow travellers
      to within a short distance of New York. When Pogram was about to leave
      them he grew thoughtful, and after pondering for some time, took Martin
      aside.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;We air going to part, sir,&rsquo; said Pogram.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Pray don&rsquo;t distress yourself,&rsquo; said Martin; &lsquo;we must bear it.&rsquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;It ain&rsquo;t that, sir,&rsquo; returned Pogram, &lsquo;not at all. But I should wish you
      to accept a copy of My oration.&rsquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Thank you,&rsquo; said Martin, &lsquo;you are very good. I shall be most happy.&rsquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;It ain&rsquo;t quite that, sir, neither,&rsquo; resumed Pogram; &lsquo;air you bold enough
      to introduce a copy into your country?&rsquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Certainly,&rsquo; said Martin. &lsquo;Why not?&rsquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Its sentiments air strong, sir,&rsquo; hinted Pogram, darkly.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;That makes no difference,&rsquo; said Martin. &lsquo;I&rsquo;ll take a dozen if you like.&rsquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;No, sir,&rsquo; retorted Pogram. &lsquo;Not A dozen. That is more than I require. If
      you are content to run the hazard, sir, here is one for your Lord
      Chancellor,&rsquo; producing it, &lsquo;and one for Your principal Secretary of State.
      I should wish them to see it, sir, as expressing what my opinions air.
      That they may not plead ignorance at a future time. But don&rsquo;t get into
      danger, sir, on my account!&rsquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;There is not the least danger, I assure you,&rsquo; said Martin. So he put the
      pamphlets in his pocket, and they parted.
    </p>
    <p>
      Mr Bevan had written in his letter that, at a certain time, which fell out
      happily just then, he would be at a certain hotel in the city, anxiously
      expecting to see them. To this place they repaired without a moment&rsquo;s
      delay. They had the satisfaction of finding him within; and of being
      received by their good friend, with his own warmth and heartiness.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;I am truly sorry and ashamed,&rsquo; said Martin, &lsquo;to have begged of you. But
      look at us. See what we are, and judge to what we are reduced!&rsquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;So far from claiming to have done you any service,&rsquo; returned the other,
      &lsquo;I reproach myself with having been, unwittingly, the original cause of
      your misfortunes. I no more supposed you would go to Eden on such
      representations as you received; or, indeed, that you would do anything
      but be dispossessed, by the readiest means, of your idea that fortunes
      were so easily made here; than I thought of going to Eden myself.&rsquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;The fact is, I closed with the thing in a mad and sanguine manner,&rsquo; said
      Martin, &lsquo;and the less said about it the better for me. Mark, here, hadn&rsquo;t
      a voice in the matter.&rsquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Well! but he hadn&rsquo;t a voice in any other matter, had he?&rsquo; returned Mr
      Bevan; laughing with an air that showed his understanding of Mark and
      Martin too.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Not a very powerful one, I am afraid,&rsquo; said Martin with a blush. &lsquo;But
      live and learn, Mr Bevan! Nearly die and learn; we learn the quicker.&rsquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Now,&rsquo; said their friend, &lsquo;about your plans. You mean to return home at
      once?&rsquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Oh, I think so,&rsquo; returned Martin hastily, for he turned pale at the
      thought of any other suggestion. &lsquo;That is your opinion too, I hope?&rsquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Unquestionably. For I don&rsquo;t know why you ever came here; though it&rsquo;s not
      such an unusual case, I am sorry to say, that we need go any farther into
      that. You don&rsquo;t know that the ship in which you came over with our friend
      General Fladdock, is in port, of course?&rsquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Indeed!&rsquo; said Martin.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Yes. And is advertised to sail to-morrow.&rsquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      This was tempting news, but tantalising too; for Martin knew that his
      getting any employment on board a ship of that class was hopeless. The
      money in his pocket would not pay one-fourth of the sum he had already
      borrowed, and if it had been enough for their passage-money, he could
      hardly have resolved to spend it. He explained this to Mr Bevan, and
      stated what their project was.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Why, that&rsquo;s as wild as Eden every bit,&rsquo; returned his friend. &lsquo;You must
      take your passage like a Christian; at least, as like a Christian as a
      fore-cabin passenger can; and owe me a few more dollars than you intend.
      If Mark will go down to the ship and see what passengers there are, and
      finds that you can go in her without being actually suffocated, my advice
      is, go! You and I will look about us in the meantime (we won&rsquo;t call at the
      Norris&rsquo;s unless you like), and we will all three dine together in the
      afternoon.&rsquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      Martin had nothing to express but gratitude, and so it was arranged. But
      he went out of the room after Mark, and advised him to take their passage
      in the Screw, though they lay upon the bare deck; which Mr Tapley, who
      needed no entreaty on the subject readily promised to do.
    </p>
    <p>
      When he and Martin met again, and were alone, he was in high spirits, and
      evidently had something to communicate, in which he gloried very much.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;I&rsquo;ve done Mr Bevan, sir,&rsquo; said Mark.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Done Mr Bevan!&rsquo; repeated Martin.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;The cook of the Screw went and got married yesterday, sir,&rsquo; said Mr
      Tapley.
    </p>
    <p>
      Martin looked at him for farther explanation.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;And when I got on board, and the word was passed that it was me,&rsquo; said
      Mark, &lsquo;the mate he comes and asks me whether I&rsquo;d engage to take this said
      cook&rsquo;s place upon the passage home. &ldquo;For you&rsquo;re used to it,&rdquo; he says; &ldquo;you
      were always a-cooking for everybody on your passage out.&rdquo; And so I was,&rsquo;
      said Mark, &lsquo;although I never cooked before, I&rsquo;ll take my oath.&rsquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;What did you say?&rsquo; demanded Martin.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Say!&rsquo; cried Mark. &lsquo;That I&rsquo;d take anything I could get. &ldquo;If that&rsquo;s so,&rdquo;
       says the mate, &ldquo;why, bring a glass of rum;&rdquo; which they brought according.
      And my wages, sir,&rsquo; said Mark in high glee, &lsquo;pays your passage; and I&rsquo;ve
      put the rolling-pin in your berth to take it (it&rsquo;s the easy one up in the
      corner); and there we are, Rule Britannia, and Britons strike home!&rsquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;There never was such a good fellow as you are!&rsquo; cried Martin seizing him
      by the hand. &lsquo;But what do you mean by &ldquo;doing&rdquo; Mr Bevan, Mark?&rsquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Why, don&rsquo;t you see?&rsquo; said Mark. &lsquo;We don&rsquo;t tell him, you know. We take his
      money, but we don&rsquo;t spend it, and we don&rsquo;t keep it. What we do is, write
      him a little note, explaining this engagement, and roll it up, and leave
      it at the bar, to be given to him after we are gone. Don&rsquo;t you see?&rsquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      Martin&rsquo;s delight in this idea was not inferior to Mark&rsquo;s. It was all done
      as he proposed. They passed a cheerful evening; slept at the hotel; left
      the letter as arranged; and went off to the ship betimes next morning,
      with such light hearts as the weight of their past miseries engendered.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Good-bye! a hundred thousand times good-bye!&rsquo; said Martin to their
      friend. &lsquo;How shall I remember all your kindness! How shall I ever thank
      you!&rsquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;If you ever become a rich man, or a powerful one,&rsquo; returned his friend,
      &lsquo;you shall try to make your Government more careful of its subjects when
      they roam abroad to live. Tell it what you know of emigration in your own
      case, and impress upon it how much suffering may be prevented with a
      little pains!&rsquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      Cheerily, lads, cheerily! Anchor weighed. Ship in full sail. Her sturdy
      bowsprit pointing true to England. America a cloud upon the sea behind
      them!
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Why, Cook! what are you thinking of so steadily?&rsquo; said Martin.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Why, I was a-thinking, sir,&rsquo; returned Mark, &lsquo;that if I was a painter and
      was called upon to paint the American Eagle, how should I do it?&rsquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Paint it as like an Eagle as you could, I suppose.&rsquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;No,&rsquo; said Mark. &lsquo;That wouldn&rsquo;t do for me, sir. I should want to draw it
      like a Bat, for its short-sightedness; like a Bantam, for its bragging;
      like a Magpie, for its honesty; like a Peacock, for its vanity; like a
      ostrich, for its putting its head in the mud, and thinking nobody sees it&mdash;&rsquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;And like a Phoenix, for its power of springing from the ashes of its
      faults and vices, and soaring up anew into the sky!&rsquo; said Martin. &lsquo;Well,
      Mark. Let us hope so.&rsquo;

      CHAPTER THIRTY-FIVE
    </h2>
    <p>
      ARRIVING IN ENGLAND, MARTIN WITNESSES A CEREMONY, FROM WHICH HE DERIVES
      THE CHEERING INFORMATION THAT HE HAS NOT BEEN FORGOTTEN IN HIS ABSENCE
    </p>
    <p>
      It was mid-day, and high water in the English port for which the Screw was
      bound, when, borne in gallantly upon the fullness of the tide, she let go
      her anchor in the river.
    </p>
    <p>
      Bright as the scene was; fresh, and full of motion; airy, free, and
      sparkling; it was nothing to the life and exultation in the breasts of the
      two travellers, at sight of the old churches, roofs, and darkened chimney
      stacks of Home. The distant roar that swelled up hoarsely from the busy
      streets, was music in their ears; the lines of people gazing from the
      wharves, were friends held dear; the canopy of smoke that overhung the
      town was brighter and more beautiful to them than if the richest silks of
      Persia had been waving in the air. And though the water going on its
      glistening track, turned, ever and again, aside to dance and sparkle round
      great ships, and heave them up; and leaped from off the blades of oars, a
      shower of diving diamonds; and wantoned with the idle boats, and swiftly
      passed, in many a sportive chase, through obdurate old iron rings, set
      deep into the stone-work of the quays; not even it was half so buoyant,
      and so restless, as their fluttering hearts, when yearning to set foot,
      once more, on native ground.
    </p>
    <p>
      A year had passed since those same spires and roofs had faded from their
      eyes. It seemed to them, a dozen years. Some trifling changes, here and
      there, they called to mind; and wondered that they were so few and slight.
      In health and fortune, prospect and resource, they came back poorer men
      than they had gone away. But it was home. And though home is a name, a
      word, it is a strong one; stronger than magician ever spoke, or spirit
      answered to, in strongest conjuration.
    </p>
    <p>
      Being set ashore, with very little money in their pockets, and no definite
      plan of operation in their heads, they sought out a cheap tavern, where
      they regaled upon a smoking steak, and certain flowing mugs of beer, as
      only men just landed from the sea can revel in the generous dainties of
      the earth. When they had feasted, as two grateful-tempered giants might
      have done, they stirred the fire, drew back the glowing curtain from the
      window, and making each a sofa for himself, by union of the great unwieldy
      chairs, gazed blissfully into the street.
    </p>
    <p>
      Even the street was made a fairy street, by being half hidden in an
      atmosphere of steak, and strong, stout, stand-up English beer. For on the
      window-glass hung such a mist, that Mr Tapley was obliged to rise and wipe
      it with his handkerchief, before the passengers appeared like common
      mortals. And even then, a spiral little cloud went curling up from their
      two glasses of hot grog, which nearly hid them from each other.
    </p>
    <p>
      It was one of those unaccountable little rooms which are never seen
      anywhere but in a tavern, and are supposed to have got into taverns by
      reason of the facilities afforded to the architect for getting drunk while
      engaged in their construction. It had more corners in it than the brain of
      an obstinate man; was full of mad closets, into which nothing could be put
      that was not specially invented and made for that purpose; had mysterious
      shelvings and bulkheads, and indications of staircases in the ceiling; and
      was elaborately provided with a bell that rung in the room itself, about
      two feet from the handle, and had no connection whatever with any other
      part of the establishment. It was a little below the pavement, and abutted
      close upon it; so that passengers grated against the window-panes with
      their buttons, and scraped it with their baskets; and fearful boys
      suddenly coming between a thoughtful guest and the light, derided him, or
      put out their tongues as if he were a physician; or made white knobs on
      the ends of their noses by flattening the same against the glass, and
      vanished awfully, like spectres.
    </p>
    <p>
      Martin and Mark sat looking at the people as they passed, debating every
      now and then what their first step should be.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;We want to see Miss Mary, of course,&rsquo; said Mark.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Of course,&rsquo; said Martin. &lsquo;But I don&rsquo;t know where she is. Not having had
      the heart to write in our distress&mdash;you yourself thought silence most
      advisable&mdash;and consequently, never having heard from her since we
      left New York the first time, I don&rsquo;t know where she is, my good fellow.&rsquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;My opinion is, sir,&rsquo; returned Mark, &lsquo;that what we&rsquo;ve got to do is to
      travel straight to the Dragon. There&rsquo;s no need for you to go there, where
      you&rsquo;re known, unless you like. You may stop ten mile short of it. I&rsquo;ll go
      on. Mrs Lupin will tell me all the news. Mr Pinch will give me every
      information that we want; and right glad Mr Pinch will be to do it. My
      proposal is: To set off walking this afternoon. To stop when we are tired.
      To get a lift when we can. To walk when we can&rsquo;t. To do it at once, and do
      it cheap.&rsquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Unless we do it cheap, we shall have some difficulty in doing it at all,&rsquo;
      said Martin, pulling out the bank, and telling it over in his hand.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;The greater reason for losing no time, sir,&rsquo; replied Mark. &lsquo;Whereas, when
      you&rsquo;ve seen the young lady; and know what state of mind the old
      gentleman&rsquo;s in, and all about it; then you&rsquo;ll know what to do next.&rsquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;No doubt,&rsquo; said Martin. &lsquo;You are quite right.&rsquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      They were raising their glasses to their lips, when their hands stopped
      midway, and their gaze was arrested by a figure which slowly, very slowly,
      and reflectively, passed the window at that moment.
    </p>
    <p>
      Mr Pecksniff. Placid, calm, but proud. Honestly proud. Dressed with
      peculiar care, smiling with even more than usual blandness, pondering on
      the beauties of his art with a mild abstraction from all sordid thoughts,
      and gently travelling across the disc, as if he were a figure in a magic
      lantern.
    </p>
    <p>
      As Mr Pecksniff passed, a person coming in the opposite direction stopped
      to look after him with great interest and respect, almost with veneration;
      and the landlord bouncing out of the house, as if he had seen him too,
      joined this person, and spoke to him, and shook his head gravely, and
      looked after Mr Pecksniff likewise.
    </p>
    <p>
      Martin and Mark sat staring at each other, as if they could not believe
      it; but there stood the landlord, and the other man still. In spite of the
      indignation with which this glimpse of Mr Pecksniff had inspired him,
      Martin could not help laughing heartily. Neither could Mark.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;We must inquire into this!&rsquo; said Martin. &lsquo;Ask the landlord in, Mark.&rsquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      Mr Tapley retired for that purpose, and immediately returned with their
      large-headed host in safe convoy.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Pray, landlord!&rsquo; said Martin, &lsquo;who is that gentleman who passed just now,
      and whom you were looking after?&rsquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      The landlord poked the fire as if, in his desire to make the most of his
      answer, he had become indifferent even to the price of coals; and putting
      his hands in his pockets, said, after inflating himself to give still
      further effect to his reply:
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;That, gentlemen, is the great Mr Pecksniff! The celebrated architect,
      gentlemen!&rsquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      He looked from one to the other while he said it, as if he were ready to
      assist the first man who might be overcome by the intelligence.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;The great Mr Pecksniff, the celebrated architect, gentlemen.&rsquo; said the
      landlord, &lsquo;has come down here, to help to lay the first stone of a new and
      splendid public building.&rsquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Is it to be built from his designs?&rsquo; asked Martin.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;The great Mr Pecksniff, the celebrated architect, gentlemen,&rsquo; returned
      the landlord, who seemed to have an unspeakable delight in the repetition
      of these words, &lsquo;carried off the First Premium, and will erect the
      building.&rsquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Who lays the stone?&rsquo; asked Martin.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Our member has come down express,&rsquo; returned the landlord. &lsquo;No scrubs
      would do for no such a purpose. Nothing less would satisfy our Directors
      than our member in the House of Commons, who is returned upon the
      Gentlemanly Interest.&rsquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Which interest is that?&rsquo; asked Martin.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;What, don&rsquo;t you know!&rsquo; returned the landlord.
    </p>
    <p>
      It was quite clear the landlord didn&rsquo;t. They always told him at election
      time, that it was the Gentlemanly side, and he immediately put on his
      top-boots, and voted for it.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;When does the ceremony take place?&rsquo; asked Martin.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;This day,&rsquo; replied the landlord. Then pulling out his watch, he added,
      impressively, &lsquo;almost this minute.&rsquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      Martin hastily inquired whether there was any possibility of getting in to
      witness it; and finding that there would be no objection to the admittance
      of any decent person, unless indeed the ground were full, hurried off with
      Mark, as hard as they could go.
    </p>
    <p>
      They were fortunate enough to squeeze themselves into a famous corner on
      the ground, where they could see all that passed, without much dread of
      being beheld by Mr Pecksniff in return. They were not a minute too soon,
      for as they were in the act of congratulating each other, a great noise
      was heard at some distance, and everybody looked towards the gate. Several
      ladies prepared their pocket handkerchiefs for waving; and a stray teacher
      belonging to the charity school being much cheered by mistake, was
      immensely groaned at when detected.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Perhaps he has Tom Pinch with him,&rsquo; Martin whispered Mr Tapley.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;It would be rather too much of a treat for him, wouldn&rsquo;t it, sir?&rsquo;
      whispered Mr Tapley in return.
    </p>
    <p>
      There was no time to discuss the probabilities either way, for the charity
      school, in clean linen, came filing in two and two, so much to the
      self-approval of all the people present who didn&rsquo;t subscribe to it, that
      many of them shed tears. A band of music followed, led by a conscientious
      drummer who never left off. Then came a great many gentlemen with wands in
      their hands, and bows on their breasts, whose share in the proceedings did
      not appear to be distinctly laid down, and who trod upon each other, and
      blocked up the entry for a considerable period. These were followed by the
      Mayor and Corporation, all clustering round the member for the Gentlemanly
      Interest; who had the great Mr Pecksniff, the celebrated architect on his
      right hand, and conversed with him familiarly as they came along. Then the
      ladies waved their handkerchiefs, and the gentlemen their hats, and the
      charity children shrieked, and the member for the Gentlemanly Interest
      bowed.
    </p>
    <p>
      Silence being restored, the member for the Gentlemanly Interest rubbed his
      hands, and wagged his head, and looked about him pleasantly; and there was
      nothing this member did, at which some lady or other did not burst into an
      ecstatic waving of her pocket handkerchief. When he looked up at the
      stone, they said how graceful! when he peeped into the hole, they said how
      condescending! when he chatted with the Mayor, they said how easy! when he
      folded his arms they cried with one accord, how statesman-like!
    </p>
    <p>
      Mr Pecksniff was observed too, closely. When he talked to the Mayor, they
      said, Oh, really, what a courtly man he was! When he laid his hand upon
      the mason&rsquo;s shoulder, giving him directions, how pleasant his demeanour to
      the working classes; just the sort of man who made their toil a pleasure
      to them, poor dear souls!
    </p>
    <p>
      But now a silver trowel was brought; and when the member for the
      Gentlemanly Interest, tucking up his coat-sleeve, did a little sleight of
      hand with the mortar, the air was rent, so loud was the applause. The
      workman-like manner in which he did it was amazing. No one could conceive
      where such a gentlemanly creature could have picked the knowledge up.
    </p>
    <p>
      When he had made a kind of dirt-pie under the direction of the mason, they
      brought a little vase containing coins, the which the member for the
      Gentlemanly Interest jingled, as if he were going to conjure. Whereat they
      said how droll, how cheerful, what a flow of spirits! This put into its
      place, an ancient scholar read the inscription, which was in Latin; not in
      English; that would never do. It gave great satisfaction; especially every
      time there was a good long substantive in the third declension, ablative
      case, with an adjective to match; at which periods the assembly became
      very tender, and were much affected.
    </p>
    <p>
      And now the stone was lowered down into its place, amidst the shouting of
      the concourse. When it was firmly fixed, the member for the Gentlemanly
      Interest struck upon it thrice with the handle of the trowel, as if
      inquiring, with a touch of humour, whether anybody was at home. Mr
      Pecksniff then unrolled his Plans (prodigious plans they were), and people
      gathered round to look at and admire them.
    </p>
    <p>
      Martin, who had been fretting himself&mdash;quite unnecessarily, as Mark
      thought&mdash;during the whole of these proceedings, could no longer
      restrain his impatience; but stepping forward among several others, looked
      straight over the shoulder of the unconscious Mr Pecksniff, at the designs
      and plans he had unrolled. He returned to Mark, boiling with rage.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Why, what&rsquo;s the matter, sir?&rsquo; cried Mark.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Matter! This is <i>my</i> building.&rsquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Your building, sir!&rsquo; said Mark.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;My grammar-school. I invented it. I did it all. He has only put four
      windows in, the villain, and spoilt it!&rsquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      Mark could hardly believe it at first, but being assured that it was
      really so, actually held him to prevent his interference foolishly, until
      his temporary heat was past. In the meantime, the member addressed the
      company on the gratifying deed which he had just performed.
    </p>
    <p>
      He said that since he had sat in Parliament to represent the Gentlemanly
      Interest of that town; and he might add, the Lady Interest, he hoped,
      besides (pocket handkerchiefs); it had been his pleasant duty to come
      among them, and to raise his voice on their behalf in Another Place
      (pocket handkerchiefs and laughter), often. But he had never come among
      them, and had never raised his voice, with half such pure, such deep, such
      unalloyed delight, as now. &lsquo;The present occasion,&rsquo; he said, &lsquo;will ever be
      memorable to me; not only for the reasons I have assigned, but because it
      has afforded me an opportunity of becoming personally known to a gentleman&mdash;&rsquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      Here he pointed the trowel at Mr Pecksniff, who was greeted with
      vociferous cheering, and laid his hand upon his heart.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;To a gentleman who, I am happy to believe, will reap both distinction and
      profit from this field; whose fame had previously penetrated to me&mdash;as
      to whose ears has it not!&mdash;but whose intellectual countenance I never
      had the distinguished honour to behold until this day, and whose
      intellectual conversation I had never before the improving pleasure to
      enjoy.&rsquo;
    </p>
<div class="fig" style="width:65%">
      <img src="images/20571m.jpg" alt="20571m " width="100%" /><br />
    </div>
    <h5>
      <a href="images/20571.jpg"><i>Original</i></a>
    </h5>
    <p>
      Everybody seemed very glad of this, and applauded more than ever.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;But I hope my Honourable Friend,&rsquo; said the Gentlemanly member&mdash;of
      course he added &ldquo;if he will allow me to call him so,&rdquo; and of course Mr
      Pecksniff bowed&mdash;&lsquo;will give me many opportunities of cultivating the
      knowledge of him; and that I may have the extraordinary gratification of
      reflecting in after-time that I laid on this day two first stones, both
      belonging to structures which shall last my life!&rsquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      Great cheering again. All this time, Martin was cursing Mr Pecksniff up
      hill and down dale.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;My friends!&rsquo; said Mr Pecksniff, in reply. &lsquo;My duty is to build, not
      speak; to act, not talk; to deal with marble, stone, and brick; not
      language. I am very much affected. God bless you!&rsquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      This address, pumped out apparently from Mr Pecksniff&rsquo;s very heart,
      brought the enthusiasm to its highest pitch. The pocket handkerchiefs were
      waved again; the charity children were admonished to grow up Pecksniffs,
      every boy among them; the Corporation, gentlemen with wands, member for
      the Gentlemanly Interest, all cheered for Mr Pecksniff. Three cheers for
      Mr Pecksniff! Three more for Mr Pecksniff! Three more for Mr Pecksniff,
      gentlemen, if you please! One more, gentlemen, for Mr Pecksniff, and let
      it be a good one to finish with!
    </p>
    <p>
      In short, Mr Pecksniff was supposed to have done a great work and was very
      kindly, courteously, and generously rewarded. When the procession moved
      away, and Martin and Mark were left almost alone upon the ground, his
      merits and a desire to acknowledge them formed the common topic. He was
      only second to the Gentlemanly member.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Compare the fellow&rsquo;s situation to-day with ours!&rsquo; said Martin bitterly.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Lord bless you, sir!&rsquo; cried Mark, &lsquo;what&rsquo;s the use? Some architects are
      clever at making foundations, and some architects are clever at building
      on &lsquo;em when they&rsquo;re made. But it&rsquo;ll all come right in the end, sir; it&rsquo;ll
      all come right!&rsquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;And in the meantime&mdash;&rsquo; began Martin.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;In the meantime, as you say, sir, we have a deal to do, and far to go. So
      sharp&rsquo;s the word, and Jolly!&rsquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;You are the best master in the world, Mark,&rsquo; said Martin, &lsquo;and I will not
      be a bad scholar if I can help it, I am resolved! So come! Best foot
      foremost, old fellow!&rsquo;
    </p>

      CHAPTER THIRTY-SIX
    </h2>
    <h3>
      TOM PINCH DEPARTS TO SEEK HIS FORTUNE. WHAT HE FINDS AT STARTING
    </h3>
    <p>
      Oh! What a different town Salisbury was in Tom Pinch&rsquo;s eyes to be sure,
      when the substantial Pecksniff of his heart melted away into an idle
      dream! He possessed the same faith in the wonderful shops, the same
      intensified appreciation of the mystery and wickedness of the place; made
      the same exalted estimate of its wealth, population, and resources; and
      yet it was not the old city nor anything like it. He walked into the
      market while they were getting breakfast ready for him at the Inn; and
      though it was the same market as of old, crowded by the same buyers and
      sellers; brisk with the same business; noisy with the same confusion of
      tongues and cluttering of fowls in coops; fair with the same display of
      rolls of butter, newly made, set forth in linen cloths of dazzling
      whiteness; green with the same fresh show of dewy vegetables; dainty with
      the same array in higglers&rsquo; baskets of small shaving-glasses, laces,
      braces, trouser-straps, and hardware; savoury with the same unstinted show
      of delicate pigs&rsquo; feet, and pies made precious by the pork that once had
      walked upon them; still it was strangely changed to Tom. For, in the
      centre of the market-place, he missed a statue he had set up there as in
      all other places of his personal resort; and it looked cold and bare
      without that ornament.
    </p>
    <p>
      The change lay no deeper than this, for Tom was far from being sage enough
      to know, that, having been disappointed in one man, it would have been a
      strictly rational and eminently wise proceeding to have revenged himself
      upon mankind in general, by mistrusting them one and all. Indeed this
      piece of justice, though it is upheld by the authority of divers profound
      poets and honourable men, bears a nearer resemblance to the justice of
      that good Vizier in the Thousand-and-one Nights, who issues orders for the
      destruction of all the Porters in Bagdad because one of that unfortunate
      fraternity is supposed to have misconducted himself, than to any logical,
      not to say Christian, system of conduct, known to the world in later
      times.
    </p>
    <p>
      Tom had so long been used to steep the Pecksniff of his fancy in his tea,
      and spread him out upon his toast, and take him as a relish with his beer,
      that he made but a poor breakfast on the first morning after his
      expulsion. Nor did he much improve his appetite for dinner by seriously
      considering his own affairs, and taking counsel thereon with his friend
      the organist&rsquo;s assistant.
    </p>
    <p>
      The organist&rsquo;s assistant gave it as his decided opinion that whatever Tom
      did, he must go to London; for there was no place like it. Which may be
      true in the main, though hardly, perhaps, in itself, a sufficient reason
      for Tom&rsquo;s going there.
    </p>
    <p>
      But Tom had thought of London before, and had coupled with it thoughts of
      his sister, and of his old friend John Westlock, whose advice he naturally
      felt disposed to seek in this important crisis of his fortunes. To London,
      therefore, he resolved to go; and he went away to the coach-office at
      once, to secure his place. The coach being already full, he was obliged to
      postpone his departure until the next night; but even this circumstance
      had its bright side as well as its dark one, for though it threatened to
      reduce his poor purse with unexpected country charges, it afforded him an
      opportunity of writing to Mrs Lupin and appointing his box to be brought
      to the old finger-post at the old time; which would enable him to take
      that treasure with him to the metropolis, and save the expense of its
      carriage. &lsquo;So,&rsquo; said Tom, comforting himself, &lsquo;it&rsquo;s very nearly as broad
      as it&rsquo;s long.&rsquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      And it cannot be denied that, when he had made up his mind to even this
      extent, he felt an unaccustomed sense of freedom&mdash;a vague and
      indistinct impression of holiday-making&mdash;which was very luxurious. He
      had his moments of depression and anxiety, and they were, with good
      reason, pretty numerous; but still, it was wonderfully pleasant to reflect
      that he was his own master, and could plan and scheme for himself. It was
      startling, thrilling, vast, difficult to understand; it was a stupendous
      truth, teeming with responsibility and self-distrust; but in spite of all
      his cares, it gave a curious relish to the viands at the Inn, and
      interposed a dreamy haze between him and his prospects, in which they
      sometimes showed to magical advantage.
    </p>
    <p>
      In this unsettled state of mind, Tom went once more to bed in the low
      four-poster, to the same immovable surprise of the effigies of the former
      landlord and the fat ox; and in this condition, passed the whole of the
      succeeding day. When the coach came round at last with &lsquo;London&rsquo; blazoned
      in letters of gold upon the boot, it gave Tom such a turn, that he was
      half disposed to run away. But he didn&rsquo;t do it; for he took his seat upon
      the box instead, and looking down upon the four greys, felt as if he were
      another grey himself, or, at all events, a part of the turn-out; and was
      quite confused by the novelty and splendour of his situation.
    </p>
    <p>
      And really it might have confused a less modest man than Tom to find
      himself sitting next that coachman; for of all the swells that ever
      flourished a whip professionally, he might have been elected emperor. He
      didn&rsquo;t handle his gloves like another man, but put them on&mdash;even when
      he was standing on the pavement, quite detached from the coach&mdash;as if
      the four greys were, somehow or other, at the ends of the fingers. It was
      the same with his hat. He did things with his hat, which nothing but an
      unlimited knowledge of horses and the wildest freedom of the road, could
      ever have made him perfect in. Valuable little parcels were brought to him
      with particular instructions, and he pitched them into this hat, and stuck
      it on again; as if the laws of gravity did not admit of such an event as
      its being knocked off or blown off, and nothing like an accident could
      befall it. The guard, too! Seventy breezy miles a day were written in his
      very whiskers. His manners were a canter; his conversation a round trot.
      He was a fast coach upon a down-hill turnpike road; he was all pace. A
      waggon couldn&rsquo;t have moved slowly, with that guard and his key-bugle on
      the top of it.
    </p>
    <p>
      These were all foreshadowings of London, Tom thought, as he sat upon the
      box, and looked about him. Such a coachman, and such a guard, never could
      have existed between Salisbury and any other place. The coach was none of
      your steady-going, yokel coaches, but a swaggering, rakish, dissipated
      London coach; up all night, and lying by all day, and leading a devil of a
      life. It cared no more for Salisbury than if it had been a hamlet. It
      rattled noisily through the best streets, defied the Cathedral, took the
      worst corners sharpest, went cutting in everywhere, making everything get
      out of its way; and spun along the open country-road, blowing a lively
      defiance out of its key-bugle, as its last glad parting legacy.
    </p>
    <p>
      It was a charming evening. Mild and bright. And even with the weight upon
      his mind which arose out of the immensity and uncertainty of London, Tom
      could not resist the captivating sense of rapid motion through the
      pleasant air. The four greys skimmed along, as if they liked it quite as
      well as Tom did; the bugle was in as high spirits as the greys; the
      coachman chimed in sometimes with his voice; the wheels hummed cheerfully
      in unison; the brass work on the harness was an orchestra of little bells;
      and thus, as they went clinking, jingling, rattling smoothly on, the whole
      concern, from the buckles of the leaders&rsquo; coupling-reins to the handle of
      the hind boot, was one great instrument of music.
    </p>
    <p>
      Yoho, past hedges, gates, and trees; past cottages and barns, and people
      going home from work. Yoho, past donkey-chaises, drawn aside into the
      ditch, and empty carts with rampant horses, whipped up at a bound upon the
      little watercourse, and held by struggling carters close to the
      five-barred gate, until the coach had passed the narrow turning in the
      road. Yoho, by churches dropped down by themselves in quiet nooks, with
      rustic burial-grounds about them, where the graves are green, and daisies
      sleep&mdash;for it is evening&mdash;on the bosoms of the dead. Yoho, past
      streams, in which the cattle cool their feet, and where the rushes grow;
      past paddock-fences, farms, and rick-yards; past last year&rsquo;s stacks, cut,
      slice by slice, away, and showing, in the waning light, like ruined
      gables, old and brown. Yoho, down the pebbly dip, and through the merry
      water-splash and up at a canter to the level road again. Yoho! Yoho!
    </p>
    <p>
      Was the box there, when they came up to the old finger-post? The box! Was
      Mrs Lupin herself? Had she turned out magnificently as a hostess should,
      in her own chaise-cart, and was she sitting in a mahogany chair, driving
      her own horse Dragon (who ought to have been called Dumpling), and looking
      lovely? Did the stage-coach pull up beside her, shaving her very wheel,
      and even while the guard helped her man up with the trunk, did he send the
      glad echoes of his bugle careering down the chimneys of the distant
      Pecksniff, as if the coach expressed its exultation in the rescue of Tom
      Pinch?
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;This is kind indeed!&rsquo; said Tom, bending down to shake hands with her. &lsquo;I
      didn&rsquo;t mean to give you this trouble.&rsquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Trouble, Mr Pinch!&rsquo; cried the hostess of the Dragon.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Well! It&rsquo;s a pleasure to you, I know,&rsquo; said Tom, squeezing her hand
      heartily. &lsquo;Is there any news?&rsquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      The hostess shook her head.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Say you saw me,&rsquo; said Tom, &lsquo;and that I was very bold and cheerful, and
      not a bit down-hearted; and that I entreated her to be the same, for all
      is certain to come right at last. Good-bye!&rsquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;You&rsquo;ll write when you get settled, Mr Pinch?&rsquo; said Mrs Lupin.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;When I get settled!&rsquo; cried Tom, with an involuntary opening of his eyes.
      &lsquo;Oh, yes, I&rsquo;ll write when I get settled. Perhaps I had better write
      before, because I may find that it takes a little time to settle myself;
      not having too much money, and having only one friend. I shall give your
      love to the friend, by the way. You were always great with Mr Westlock,
      you know. Good-bye!&rsquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Good-bye!&rsquo; said Mrs Lupin, hastily producing a basket with a long bottle
      sticking out of it. &lsquo;Take this. Good-bye!&rsquo;

      &lsquo;Do you want me to carry it to London for you?&rsquo; cried Tom. She was already
      turning the chaise-cart round.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;No, no,&rsquo; said Mrs Lupin. &lsquo;It&rsquo;s only a little something for refreshment on
      the road. Sit fast, Jack. Drive on, sir. All right! Good-bye!&rsquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      She was a quarter of a mile off, before Tom collected himself; and then he
      was waving his hand lustily; and so was she.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;And that&rsquo;s the last of the old finger-post,&rsquo; thought Tom, straining his
      eyes, &lsquo;where I have so often stood to see this very coach go by, and where
      I have parted with so many companions! I used to compare this coach to
      some great monster that appeared at certain times to bear my friends away
      into the world. And now it&rsquo;s bearing me away, to seek my fortune, Heaven
      knows where and how!&rsquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      It made Tom melancholy to picture himself walking up the lane and back to
      Pecksniff&rsquo;s as of old; and being melancholy, he looked downwards at the
      basket on his knee, which he had for the moment forgotten.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;She is the kindest and most considerate creature in the world,&rsquo; thought
      Tom. &lsquo;Now I <i>know </i>that she particularly told that man of hers not to look
      at me, on purpose to prevent my throwing him a shilling! I had it ready
      for him all the time, and he never once looked towards me; whereas that
      man naturally, (for I know him very well,) would have done nothing but
      grin and stare. Upon my word, the kindness of people perfectly melts me.&rsquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      Here he caught the coachman&rsquo;s eye. The coachman winked. &lsquo;Remarkable fine
      woman for her time of life,&rsquo; said the coachman.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;I quite agree with you,&rsquo; returned Tom. &lsquo;So she is.&rsquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Finer than many a young &lsquo;un, I mean to say,&rsquo; observed the coachman. &lsquo;Eh?&rsquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Than many a young one,&rsquo; Tom assented.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;I don&rsquo;t care for &lsquo;em myself when they&rsquo;re too young,&rsquo; remarked the
      coachman.
    </p>
    <p>
      This was a matter of taste, which Tom did not feel himself called upon to
      discuss.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;You&rsquo;ll seldom find &lsquo;em possessing correct opinions about refreshment, for
      instance, when they&rsquo;re too young, you know,&rsquo; said the coachman; &lsquo;a woman
      must have arrived at maturity, before her mind&rsquo;s equal to coming provided
      with a basket like that.&rsquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Perhaps you would like to know what it contains?&rsquo; said Tom, smiling.
    </p>
    <p>
      As the coachman only laughed, and as Tom was curious himself, he unpacked
      it, and put the articles, one by one, upon the footboard. A cold roast
      fowl, a packet of ham in slices, a crusty loaf, a piece of cheese, a paper
      of biscuits, half a dozen apples, a knife, some butter, a screw of salt,
      and a bottle of old sherry. There was a letter besides, which Tom put in
      his pocket.
    </p>
    <p>
      The coachman was so earnest in his approval of Mrs Lupin&rsquo;s provident
      habits, and congratulated Torn so warmly on his good fortune, that Tom
      felt it necessary, for the lady&rsquo;s sake, to explain that the basket was a
      strictly Platonic basket, and had merely been presented to him in the way
      of friendship. When he had made the statement with perfect gravity; for he
      felt it incumbent on him to disabuse the mind of this lax rover of any
      incorrect impressions on the subject; he signified that he would be happy
      to share the gifts with him, and proposed that they should attack the
      basket in a spirit of good fellowship at any time in the course of the
      night which the coachman&rsquo;s experience and knowledge of the road might
      suggest, as being best adapted to the purpose. From this time they chatted
      so pleasantly together, that although Tom knew infinitely more of unicorns
      than horses, the coachman informed his friend the guard at the end of the
      next stage, &lsquo;that rum as the box-seat looked, he was as good a one to go,
      in pint of conversation, as ever he&rsquo;d wish to sit by.&rsquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      Yoho, among the gathering shades; making of no account the deep
      reflections of the trees, but scampering on through light and darkness,
      all the same, as if the light of London fifty miles away, were quite
      enough to travel by, and some to spare. Yoho, beside the village green,
      where cricket-players linger yet, and every little indentation made in the
      fresh grass by bat or wicket, ball or player&rsquo;s foot, sheds out its perfume
      on the night. Away with four fresh horses from the Bald-faced Stag, where
      topers congregate about the door admiring; and the last team with traces
      hanging loose, go roaming off towards the pond, until observed and shouted
      after by a dozen throats, while volunteering boys pursue them. Now, with a
      clattering of hoofs and striking out of fiery sparks, across the old stone
      bridge, and down again into the shadowy road, and through the open gate,
      and far away, away, into the wold. Yoho!
    </p>
    <p>
      Yoho, behind there, stop that bugle for a moment! Come creeping over to
      the front, along the coach-roof, guard, and make one at this basket! Not
      that we slacken in our pace the while, not we; we rather put the bits of
      blood upon their metal, for the greater glory of the snack. Ah! It is long
      since this bottle of old wine was brought into contact with the mellow
      breath of night, you may depend, and rare good stuff it is to wet a
      bugler&rsquo;s whistle with. Only try it. Don&rsquo;t be afraid of turning up your
      finger, Bill, another pull! Now, take your breath, and try the bugle,
      Bill. There&rsquo;s music! There&rsquo;s a tone!&rsquo; over the hills and far away,&rsquo;
      indeed. Yoho! The skittish mare is all alive to-night. Yoho! Yoho!
    </p>
    <p>
      See the bright moon! High up before we know it; making the earth reflect
      the objects on its breast like water. Hedges, trees, low cottages, church
      steeples, blighted stumps and flourishing young slips, have all grown vain
      upon the sudden, and mean to contemplate their own fair images till
      morning. The poplars yonder rustle that their quivering leaves may see
      themselves upon the ground. Not so the oak; trembling does not become <i>him</i>;
      and he watches himself in his stout old burly steadfastness, without the
      motion of a twig. The moss-grown gate, ill-poised upon its creaking
      hinges, crippled and decayed swings to and fro before its glass, like some
      fantastic dowager; while our own ghostly likeness travels on, Yoho! Yoho!
      through ditch and brake, upon the ploughed land and the smooth, along the
      steep hillside and steeper wall, as if it were a phantom-Hunter.
    </p>
    <p>
      Clouds too! And a mist upon the Hollow! Not a dull fog that hides it, but
      a light airy gauze-like mist, which in our eyes of modest admiration gives
      a new charm to the beauties it is spread before; as real gauze has done
      ere now, and would again, so please you, though we were the Pope. Yoho!
      Why now we travel like the Moon herself. Hiding this minute in a grove of
      trees; next minute in a patch of vapour; emerging now upon our broad clear
      course; withdrawing now, but always dashing on, our journey is a
      counter-part of hers. Yoho! A match against the Moon!
    </p>
    <p>
      The beauty of the night is hardly felt, when Day comes rushing up. Yoho!
      Two stages, and the country roads are almost changed to a continuous
      street. Yoho, past market-gardens, rows of houses, villas, crescents,
      terraces, and squares; past waggons, coaches, carts; past early workmen,
      late stragglers, drunken men, and sober carriers of loads; past brick and
      mortar in its every shape; and in among the rattling pavements, where a
      jaunty-seat upon a coach is not so easy to preserve! Yoho, down countless
      turnings, and through countless mazy ways, until an old Innyard is gained,
      and Tom Pinch, getting down quite stunned and giddy, is in London!
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Five minutes before the time, too!&rsquo; said the driver, as he received his
      fee of Tom.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Upon my word,&rsquo; said Tom, &lsquo;I should not have minded very much, if we had
      been five hours after it; for at this early hour I don&rsquo;t know where to go,
      or what to do with myself.&rsquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Don&rsquo;t they expect you then?&rsquo; inquired the driver.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Who?&rsquo; said Tom.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Why them,&rsquo; returned the driver.
    </p>
    <p>
      His mind was so clearly running on the assumption of Tom&rsquo;s having come to
      town to see an extensive circle of anxious relations and friends, that it
      would have been pretty hard work to undeceive him. Tom did not try. He
      cheerfully evaded the subject, and going into the Inn, fell fast asleep
      before a fire in one of the public rooms opening from the yard. When he
      awoke, the people in the house were all astir, so he washed and dressed
      himself; to his great refreshment after the journey; and, it being by that
      time eight o&rsquo;clock, went forth at once to see his old friend John.
    </p>
    <p>
      John Westlock lived in Furnival&rsquo;s Inn, High Holborn, which was within a
      quarter of an hour&rsquo;s walk of Tom&rsquo;s starting-point, but seemed a long way
      off, by reason of his going two or three miles out of the straight road to
      make a short cut. When at last he arrived outside John&rsquo;s door, two stories
      up, he stood faltering with his hand upon the knocker, and trembled from
      head to foot. For he was rendered very nervous by the thought of having to
      relate what had fallen out between himself and Pecksniff; and he had a
      misgiving that John would exult fearfully in the disclosure.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;But it must be made,&rsquo; thought Tom, &lsquo;sooner or later; and I had better get
      it over.&rsquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      Rat tat.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;I am afraid that&rsquo;s not a London knock,&rsquo; thought Tom. &lsquo;It didn&rsquo;t sound
      bold. Perhaps that&rsquo;s the reason why nobody answers the door.&rsquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      It is quite certain that nobody came, and that Tom stood looking at the
      knocker; wondering whereabouts in the neighbourhood a certain gentleman
      resided, who was roaring out to somebody &lsquo;Come in!&rsquo; with all his might.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Bless my soul!&rsquo; thought Tom at last. &lsquo;Perhaps he lives here, and is
      calling to me. I never thought of that. Can I open the door from the
      outside, I wonder. Yes, to be sure I can.&rsquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      To be sure he could, by turning the handle; and to be sure when he did
      turn it the same voice came rushing out, crying &lsquo;Why don&rsquo;t you come in?
      Come in, do you hear? What are you standing there for?&rsquo;&mdash;quite
      violently.
    </p>
    <p>
      Tom stepped from the little passage into the room from which these sounds
      proceeded, and had barely caught a glimpse of a gentleman in a
      dressing-gown and slippers (with his boots beside him ready to put on),
      sitting at his breakfast with a newspaper in his hand, when the said
      gentleman, at the imminent hazard of oversetting his tea-table, made a
      plunge at Tom, and hugged him.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Why, Tom, my boy!&rsquo; cried the gentleman. &lsquo;Tom!&rsquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;How glad I am to see you, Mr Westlock!&rsquo; said Tom Pinch, shaking both his
      hands, and trembling more than ever. &lsquo;How kind you are!&rsquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Mr Westlock!&rsquo; repeated John, &lsquo;what do you mean by that, Pinch? You have
      not forgotten my Christian name, I suppose?&rsquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;No, John, no. I have not forgotten,&rsquo; said Thomas Pinch. &lsquo;Good gracious
      me, how kind you are!&rsquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;I never saw such a fellow in all my life!&rsquo; cried John. &lsquo;What do you mean
      by saying <i>that </i>over and over again? What did you expect me to be, I
      wonder! Here, sit down, Tom, and be a reasonable creature. How are you, my
      boy? I am delighted to see you!&rsquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;And I am delighted to see <i>you</i>,&rsquo; said Tom.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;It&rsquo;s mutual, of course,&rsquo; returned John. &lsquo;It always was, I hope. If I had
      known you had been coming, Tom, I would have had something for breakfast.
      I would rather have such a surprise than the best breakfast in the world,
      myself; but yours is another case, and I have no doubt you are as hungry
      as a hunter. You must make out as well as you can, Tom, and we&rsquo;ll
      recompense ourselves at dinner-time. You take sugar, I know; I recollect
      the sugar at Pecksniff&rsquo;s. Ha, ha, ha! How <i>is</i> Pecksniff? When did you come
      to town? <i>do</i> begin at something or other, Tom. There are only scraps here,
      but they are not at all bad. Boar&rsquo;s Head potted. Try it, Tom. Make a
      beginning whatever you do. What an old Blade you are! I am delighted to
      see you.&rsquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      While he delivered himself of these words in a state of great commotion,
      John was constantly running backwards and forwards to and from the closet,
      bringing out all sorts of things in pots, scooping extraordinary
      quantities of tea out of the caddy, dropping French rolls into his boots,
      pouring hot water over the butter, and making a variety of similar
      mistakes without disconcerting himself in the least.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;There!&rsquo; said John, sitting down for the fiftieth time, and instantly
      starting up again to make some other addition to the breakfast. &lsquo;Now we
      are as well off as we are likely to be till dinner. And now let us have
      the news, Tom. Imprimis, how&rsquo;s Pecksniff?&rsquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;I don&rsquo;t know how he is,&rsquo; was Tom&rsquo;s grave answer.
    </p>
    <p>
      John Westlock put the teapot down, and looked at him, in astonishment.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;I don&rsquo;t know how he is,&rsquo; said Thomas Pinch; &lsquo;and, saving that I wish him
      no ill, I don&rsquo;t care. I have left him, John. I have left him for ever.&rsquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Voluntarily?&rsquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Why, no, for he dismissed me. But I had first found out that I was
      mistaken in him; and I could not have remained with him under any
      circumstances. I grieve to say that you were right in your estimate of his
      character. It may be a ridiculous weakness, John, but it has been very
      painful and bitter to me to find this out, I do assure you.&rsquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      Tom had no need to direct that appealing look towards his friend, in mild
      and gentle deprecation of his answering with a laugh. John Westlock would
      as soon have thought of striking him down upon the floor.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;It was all a dream of mine,&rsquo; said Tom, &lsquo;and it is over. I&rsquo;ll tell you how
      it happened, at some other time. Bear with my folly, John. I do not, just
      now, like to think or speak about it.&rsquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;I swear to you, Tom,&rsquo; returned his friend, with great earnestness of
      manner, after remaining silent for a few moments, &lsquo;that when I see, as I
      do now, how deeply you feel this, I don&rsquo;t know whether to be glad or sorry
      that you have made the discovery at last. I reproach myself with the
      thought that I ever jested on the subject; I ought to have known better.&rsquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;My dear friend,&rsquo; said Tom, extending his hand, &lsquo;it is very generous and
      gallant in you to receive me and my disclosure in this spirit; it makes me
      blush to think that I should have felt a moment&rsquo;s uneasiness as I came
      along. You can&rsquo;t think what a weight is lifted off my mind,&rsquo; said Tom,
      taking up his knife and fork again, and looking very cheerful. &lsquo;I shall
      punish the Boar&rsquo;s Head dreadfully.&rsquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      The host, thus reminded of his duties, instantly betook himself to piling
      up all kinds of irreconcilable and contradictory viands in Tom&rsquo;s plate,
      and a very capital breakfast Tom made, and very much the better for it Tom
      felt.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;That&rsquo;s all right,&rsquo; said John, after contemplating his visitor&rsquo;s
      proceedings with infinite satisfaction. &lsquo;Now, about our plans. You are
      going to stay with me, of course. Where&rsquo;s your box?&rsquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;It&rsquo;s at the Inn,&rsquo; said Tom. &lsquo;I didn&rsquo;t intend&mdash;&rsquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Never mind what you didn&rsquo;t intend,&rsquo; John Westlock interposed. &lsquo;What you
      <i>did </i>intend is more to the purpose. You intended, in coming here, to ask my
      advice, did you not, Tom?&rsquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Certainly.&rsquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;And to take it when I gave it to you?&rsquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Yes,&rsquo; rejoined Tom, smiling, &lsquo;if it were good advice, which, being yours,
      I have no doubt it will be.&rsquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Very well. Then don&rsquo;t be an obstinate old humbug in the outset, Tom, or I
      shall shut up shop and dispense none of that invaluable commodity. You are
      on a visit to me. I wish I had an organ for you, Tom!&rsquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;So do the gentlemen downstairs, and the gentlemen overhead I have no
      doubt,&rsquo; was Tom&rsquo;s reply.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Let me see. In the first place, you will wish to see your sister this
      morning,&rsquo; pursued his friend, &lsquo;and of course you will like to go there
      alone. I&rsquo;ll walk part of the way with you; and see about a little business
      of my own, and meet you here again in the afternoon. Put that in your
      pocket, Tom. It&rsquo;s only the key of the door. If you come home first you&rsquo;ll
      want it.&rsquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Really,&rsquo; said Tom, &lsquo;quartering one&rsquo;s self upon a friend in this way&mdash;&rsquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Why, there are two keys,&rsquo; interposed John Westlock. &lsquo;I can&rsquo;t open the
      door with them both at once, can I? What a ridiculous fellow you are, Tom?
      Nothing particular you&rsquo;d like for dinner, is there?&rsquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Oh dear no,&rsquo; said Tom.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Very well, then you may as well leave it to me. Have a glass of cherry
      brandy, Tom?&rsquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Not a drop! What remarkable chambers these are!&rsquo; said Pinch &lsquo;there&rsquo;s
      everything in &lsquo;em!&rsquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Bless your soul, Tom, nothing but a few little bachelor contrivances! the
      sort of impromptu arrangements that might have suggested themselves to
      Philip Quarll or Robinson Crusoe, that&rsquo;s all. What do you say? Shall we
      walk?&rsquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;By all means,&rsquo; cried Tom. &lsquo;As soon as you like.&rsquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      Accordingly John Westlock took the French rolls out of his boots, and put
      his boots on, and dressed himself; giving Tom the paper to read in the
      meanwhile. When he returned, equipped for walking, he found Tom in a brown
      study, with the paper in his hand.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Dreaming, Tom?&rsquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;No,&rsquo; said Mr Pinch, &lsquo;No. I have been looking over the advertising sheet,
      thinking there might be something in it which would be likely to suit me.
      But, as I often think, the strange thing seems to be that nobody is
      suited. Here are all kinds of employers wanting all sorts of servants, and
      all sorts of servants wanting all kinds of employers, and they never seem
      to come together. Here is a gentleman in a public office in a position of
      temporary difficulty, who wants to borrow five hundred pounds; and in the
      very next advertisement here is another gentleman who has got exactly that
      sum to lend. But he&rsquo;ll never lend it to him, John, you&rsquo;ll find! Here is a
      lady possessing a moderate independence, who wants to board and lodge with
      a quiet, cheerful family; and here is a family describing themselves in
      those very words, &ldquo;a quiet, cheerful family,&rdquo; who want exactly such a lady
      to come and live with them. But she&rsquo;ll never go, John! Neither do any of
      these single gentlemen who want an airy bedroom, with the occasional use
      of a parlour, ever appear to come to terms with these other people who
      live in a rural situation remarkable for its bracing atmosphere, within
      five minutes&rsquo; walk of the Royal Exchange. Even those letters of the
      alphabet who are always running away from their friends and being
      entreated at the tops of columns to come back, never <i>do</i> come back, if we
      may judge from the number of times they are asked to do it and don&rsquo;t. It
      really seems,&rsquo; said Tom, relinquishing the paper with a thoughtful sigh,
      &lsquo;as if people had the same gratification in printing their complaints as
      in making them known by word of mouth; as if they found it a comfort and
      consolation to proclaim &ldquo;I want such and such a thing, and I can&rsquo;t get it,
      and I don&rsquo;t expect I ever shall!&rdquo;&rsquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      John Westlock laughed at the idea, and they went out together. So many
      years had passed since Tom was last in London, and he had known so little
      of it then, that his interest in all he saw was very great. He was
      particularly anxious, among other notorious localities, to have those
      streets pointed out to him which were appropriated to the slaughter of
      countrymen; and was quite disappointed to find, after half-an-hour&rsquo;s
      walking, that he hadn&rsquo;t had his pocket picked. But on John Westlock&rsquo;s
      inventing a pickpocket for his gratification, and pointing out a highly
      respectable stranger as one of that fraternity, he was much delighted.
    </p>
    <p>
      His friend accompanied him to within a short distance of Camberwell and
      having put him beyond the possibility of mistaking the wealthy
      brass-and-copper founder&rsquo;s, left him to make his visit. Arriving before
      the great bell-handle, Tom gave it a gentle pull. The porter appeared.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Pray does Miss Pinch live here?&rsquo; said Tom.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Miss Pinch is governess here,&rsquo; replied the porter.
    </p>
    <p>
      At the same time he looked at Tom from head to foot, as if he would have
      said, &lsquo;You are a nice man, <i>you </i>are; where did <i>you </i>come from?&rsquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;It&rsquo;s the same young lady,&rsquo; said Tom. &lsquo;It&rsquo;s quite right. Is she at home?&rsquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;I don&rsquo;t know, I&rsquo;m sure,&rsquo; rejoined the porter.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Do you think you could have the goodness to ascertain?&rsquo; said Tom. He had
      quite a delicacy in offering the suggestion, for the possibility of such a
      step did not appear to present itself to the porter&rsquo;s mind at all.
    </p>
    <p>
      The fact was that the porter in answering the gate-bell had, according to
      usage, rung the house-bell (for it is as well to do these things in the
      Baronial style while you are about it), and that there the functions of
      his office had ceased. Being hired to open and shut the gate, and not to
      explain himself to strangers, he left this little incident to be developed
      by the footman with the tags, who, at this juncture, called out from the
      door steps:
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Hollo, there! wot are you up to? This way, young man!&rsquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Oh!&rsquo; said Tom, hurrying towards him. &lsquo;I didn&rsquo;t observe that there was
      anybody else. Pray is Miss Pinch at home?&rsquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;She&rsquo;s <i>in</i>,&rsquo; replied the footman. As much as to say to Tom: &lsquo;But if you
      think she has anything to do with the proprietorship of this place you had
      better abandon that idea.&rsquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;I wish to see her, if you please,&rsquo; said Tom.
    </p>
    <p>
      The footman, being a lively young man, happened to have his attention
      caught at that moment by the flight of a pigeon, in which he took so warm
      an interest that his gaze was rivetted on the bird until it was quite out
      of sight. He then invited Tom to come in, and showed him into a parlour.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Hany neem?&rsquo; said the young man, pausing languidly at the door.
    </p>
    <p>
      It was a good thought; because without providing the stranger, in case he
      should happen to be of a warm temper, with a sufficient excuse for
      knocking him down, it implied this young man&rsquo;s estimate of his quality,
      and relieved his breast of the oppressive burden of rating him in secret
      as a nameless and obscure individual.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Say her brother, if you please,&rsquo; said Tom.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Mother?&rsquo; drawled the footman.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Brother,&rsquo; repeated Tom, slightly raising his voice. &lsquo;And if you will say,
      in the first instance, a gentleman, and then say her brother, I shall be
      obliged to you, as she does not expect me or know I am in London, and I do
      not wish to startle her.&rsquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      The young man&rsquo;s interest in Tom&rsquo;s observations had ceased long before this
      time, but he kindly waited until now; when, shutting the door, he
      withdrew.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Dear me!&rsquo; said Tom. &lsquo;This is very disrespectful and uncivil behaviour. I
      hope these are new servants here, and that Ruth is very differently
      treated.&rsquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      His cogitations were interrupted by the sound of voices in the adjoining
      room. They seemed to be engaged in high dispute, or in indignant reprimand
      of some offender; and gathering strength occasionally, broke out into a
      perfect whirlwind. It was in one of these gusts, as it appeared to Tom,
      that the footman announced him; for an abrupt and unnatural calm took
      place, and then a dead silence. He was standing before the window,
      wondering what domestic quarrel might have caused these sounds, and hoping
      Ruth had nothing to do with it, when the door opened, and his sister ran
      into his arms.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Why, bless my soul!&rsquo; said Tom, looking at her with great pride, when they
      had tenderly embraced each other, &lsquo;how altered you are Ruth! I should
      scarcely have known you, my love, if I had seen you anywhere else, I
      declare! You are so improved,&rsquo; said Tom, with inexpressible delight; &lsquo;you
      are so womanly; you are so&mdash;positively, you know, you are so
      handsome!&rsquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;If <i>you </i>think so Tom&mdash;&rsquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Oh, but everybody must think so, you know,&rsquo; said Tom, gently smoothing
      down her hair. &lsquo;It&rsquo;s matter of fact; not opinion. But what&rsquo;s the matter?&rsquo;
      said Tom, looking at her more intently, &lsquo;how flushed you are! and you have
      been crying.&rsquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;No, I have not, Tom.&rsquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Nonsense,&rsquo; said her brother stoutly. &lsquo;That&rsquo;s a story. Don&rsquo;t tell me! I
      know better. What is it, dear? I&rsquo;m not with Mr Pecksniff now. I am going
      to try and settle myself in London; and if you are not happy here (as I
      very much fear you are not, for I begin to think you have been deceiving
      me with the kindest and most affectionate intention) you shall not remain
      here.&rsquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      Oh! Tom&rsquo;s blood was rising; mind that! Perhaps the Boar&rsquo;s Head had
      something to do with it, but certainly the footman had. So had the sight
      of his pretty sister&mdash;a great deal to do with it. Tom could bear a
      good deal himself, but he was proud of her, and pride is a sensitive
      thing. He began to think, &lsquo;there are more Pecksniffs than one, perhaps,&rsquo;
      and by all the pins and needles that run up and down in angry veins, Tom
      was in a most unusual tingle all at once!
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;We will talk about it, Tom,&rsquo; said Ruth, giving him another kiss to pacify
      him. &lsquo;I am afraid I cannot stay here.&rsquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Cannot!&rsquo; replied Tom. &lsquo;Why then, you shall not, my love. Heyday! You are
      not an object of charity! Upon my word!&rsquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      Tom was stopped in these exclamations by the footman, who brought a
      message from his master, importing that he wished to speak with him before
      he went, and with Miss Pinch also.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Show the way,&rsquo; said Tom. &lsquo;I&rsquo;ll wait upon him at once.&rsquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      Accordingly they entered the adjoining room from which the noise of
      altercation had proceeded; and there they found a middle-aged gentleman,
      with a pompous voice and manner, and a middle-aged lady, with what may be
      termed an excisable face, or one in which starch and vinegar were
      decidedly employed. There was likewise present that eldest pupil of Miss
      Pinch, whom Mrs Todgers, on a previous occasion, had called a syrup, and
      who was now weeping and sobbing spitefully.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;My brother, sir,&rsquo; said Ruth Pinch, timidly presenting Tom.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Oh!&rsquo; cried the gentleman, surveying Tom attentively. &lsquo;You really are Miss
      Pinch&rsquo;s brother, I presume? You will excuse my asking. I don&rsquo;t observe any
      resemblance.&rsquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Miss Pinch has a brother, I know,&rsquo; observed the lady.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Miss Pinch is always talking about her brother, when she ought to be
      engaged upon my education,&rsquo; sobbed the pupil.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Sophia! Hold your tongue!&rsquo; observed the gentleman. &lsquo;Sit down, if you
      please,&rsquo; addressing Tom.
    </p>
    <p>
      Tom sat down, looking from one face to another, in mute surprise.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Remain here, if you please, Miss Pinch,&rsquo; pursued the gentleman, looking
      slightly over his shoulder.
    </p>
    <p>
      Tom interrupted him here, by rising to place a chair for his sister.
      Having done which he sat down again.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;I am glad you chance to have called to see your sister to-day, sir,&rsquo;
      resumed the brass-and-copper founder. &lsquo;For although I do not approve, as a
      principle, of any young person engaged in my family in the capacity of a
      governess, receiving visitors, it happens in this case to be well timed. I
      am sorry to inform you that we are not at all satisfied with your sister.&rsquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;We are very much <i>dis</i>satisfied with her,&rsquo; observed the lady.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;I&rsquo;d never say another lesson to Miss Pinch if I was to be beat to death
      for it!&rsquo; sobbed the pupil.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Sophia!&rsquo; cried her father. &lsquo;Hold your tongue!&rsquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Will you allow me to inquire what your ground of dissatisfaction is?&rsquo;
      asked Tom.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Yes,&rsquo; said the gentleman, &lsquo;I will. I don&rsquo;t recognize it as a right; but I
      will. Your sister has not the slightest innate power of commanding
      respect. It has been a constant source of difference between us. Although
      she has been in this family for some time, and although the young lady who
      is now present has almost, as it were, grown up under her tuition, that
      young lady has no respect for her. Miss Pinch has been perfectly unable to
      command my daughter&rsquo;s respect, or to win my daughter&rsquo;s confidence. Now,&rsquo;
      said the gentleman, allowing the palm of his hand to fall gravely down
      upon the table: &lsquo;I maintain that there is something radically wrong in
      that! You, as her brother, may be disposed to deny it&mdash;&rsquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;I beg your pardon, sir,&rsquo; said Tom. &lsquo;I am not at all disposed to deny it.
      I am sure that there is something radically wrong; radically monstrous, in
      that.&rsquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Good Heavens!&rsquo; cried the gentleman, looking round the room with dignity,
      &lsquo;what do I find to be the case! what results obtrude themselves upon me as
      flowing from this weakness of character on the part of Miss Pinch! What
      are my feelings as a father, when, after my desire (repeatedly expressed
      to Miss Pinch, as I think she will not venture to deny) that my daughter
      should be choice in her expressions, genteel in her deportment, as becomes
      her station in life, and politely distant to her inferiors in society, I
      find her, only this very morning, addressing Miss Pinch herself as a
      beggar!&rsquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;A beggarly thing,&rsquo; observed the lady, in correction.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Which is worse,&rsquo; said the gentleman, triumphantly; &lsquo;which is worse. A
      beggarly thing. A low, coarse, despicable expression!&rsquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Most despicable,&rsquo; cried Tom. &lsquo;I am glad to find that there is a just
      appreciation of it here.&rsquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;So just, sir,&rsquo; said the gentleman, lowering his voice to be the more
      impressive. &lsquo;So just, that, but for my knowing Miss Pinch to be an
      unprotected young person, an orphan, and without friends, I would, as I
      assured Miss Pinch, upon my veracity and personal character, a few minutes
      ago, I would have severed the connection between us at that moment and
      from that time.&rsquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Bless my soul, sir!&rsquo; cried Tom, rising from his seat; for he was now
      unable to contain himself any longer; &lsquo;don&rsquo;t allow such considerations as
      those to influence you, pray. They don&rsquo;t exist, sir. She is not
      unprotected. She is ready to depart this instant. Ruth, my dear, get your
      bonnet on!&rsquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Oh, a pretty family!&rsquo; cried the lady. &lsquo;Oh, he&rsquo;s her brother! There&rsquo;s no
      doubt about that!&rsquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;As little doubt, madam,&rsquo; said Tom, &lsquo;as that the young lady yonder is the
      child of your teaching, and not my sister&rsquo;s. Ruth, my dear, get your
      bonnet on!&rsquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;When you say, young man,&rsquo; interposed the brass-and-copper founder,
      haughtily, &lsquo;with that impertinence which is natural to you, and which I
      therefore do not condescend to notice further, that the young lady, my
      eldest daughter, has been educated by any one but Miss Pinch, you&mdash;I
      needn&rsquo;t proceed. You comprehend me fully. I have no doubt you are used to
      it.&rsquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Sir!&rsquo; cried Tom, after regarding him in silence for some little time. &lsquo;If
      you do not understand what I mean, I will tell you. If you do understand
      what I mean, I beg you not to repeat that mode of expressing yourself in
      answer to it. My meaning is, that no man can expect his children to
      respect what he degrades.&rsquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Ha, ha, ha!&rsquo; laughed the gentleman. &lsquo;Cant! cant! The common cant!&rsquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;The common story, sir!&rsquo; said Tom; &lsquo;the story of a common mind. Your
      governess cannot win the confidence and respect of your children,
      forsooth! Let her begin by winning yours, and see what happens then.&rsquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Miss Pinch is getting her bonnet on, I trust, my dear?&rsquo; said the
      gentleman.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;I trust she is,&rsquo; said Tom, forestalling the reply. &lsquo;I have no doubt she
      is. In the meantime I address myself to you, sir. You made your statement
      to me, sir; you required to see me for that purpose; and I have a right to
      answer it. I am not loud or turbulent,&rsquo; said Tom, which was quite true,
      &lsquo;though I can scarcely say as much for you, in your manner of addressing
      yourself to me. And I wish, on my sister&rsquo;s behalf, to state the simple
      truth.&rsquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;You may state anything you like, young man,&rsquo; returned the gentleman,
      affecting to yawn. &lsquo;My dear, Miss Pinch&rsquo;s money.&rsquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;When you tell me,&rsquo; resumed Tom, who was not the less indignant for
      keeping himself quiet, &lsquo;that my sister has no innate power of commanding
      the respect of your children, I must tell you it is not so; and that she
      has. She is as well bred, as well taught, as well qualified by nature to
      command respect, as any hirer of a governess you know. But when you place
      her at a disadvantage in reference to every servant in your house, how can
      you suppose, if you have the gift of common sense, that she is not in a
      tenfold worse position in reference to your daughters?&rsquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Pretty well! Upon my word,&rsquo; exclaimed the gentleman, &lsquo;this is pretty
      well!&rsquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;It is very ill, sir,&rsquo; said Tom. &lsquo;It is very bad and mean, and wrong and
      cruel. Respect! I believe young people are quick enough to observe and
      imitate; and why or how should they respect whom no one else respects, and
      everybody slights? And very partial they must grow&mdash;oh, very partial!&mdash;to
      their studies, when they see to what a pass proficiency in those same
      tasks has brought their governess! Respect! Put anything the most
      deserving of respect before your daughters in the light in which you place
      her, and you will bring it down as low, no matter what it is!&rsquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;You speak with extreme impertinence, young man,&rsquo; observed the gentleman.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;I speak without passion, but with extreme indignation and contempt for
      such a course of treatment, and for all who practice it,&rsquo; said Tom. &lsquo;Why,
      how can you, as an honest gentleman, profess displeasure or surprise at
      your daughter telling my sister she is something beggarly and humble, when
      you are for ever telling her the same thing yourself in fifty plain,
      outspeaking ways, though not in words; and when your very porter and
      footman make the same delicate announcement to all comers? As to your
      suspicion and distrust of her; even of her word; if she is not above their
      reach, you have no right to employ her.&rsquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;No right!&rsquo; cried the brass-and-copper founder.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Distinctly not,&rsquo; Tom answered. &lsquo;If you imagine that the payment of an
      annual sum of money gives it to you, you immensely exaggerate its power
      and value. Your money is the least part of your bargain in such a case.
      You may be punctual in that to half a second on the clock, and yet be
      Bankrupt. I have nothing more to say,&rsquo; said Tom, much flushed and
      flustered, now that it was over, &lsquo;except to crave permission to stand in
      your garden until my sister is ready.&rsquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      Not waiting to obtain it, Tom walked out.
    </p>
    <p>
      Before he had well begun to cool, his sister joined him. She was crying;
      and Tom could not bear that any one about the house should see her doing
      that.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;They will think you are sorry to go,&rsquo; said Tom. &lsquo;You are not sorry to
      go?&rsquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;No, Tom, no. I have been anxious to go for a very long time.&rsquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Very well, then! Don&rsquo;t cry!&rsquo; said Tom.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;I am so sorry for <i>you</i>, dear,&rsquo; sobbed Tom&rsquo;s sister.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;But you ought to be glad on my account,&rsquo; said Tom. &lsquo;I shall be twice as
      happy with you for a companion. Hold up your head. There! Now we go out as
      we ought. Not blustering, you know, but firm and confident in ourselves.&rsquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      The idea of Tom and his sister blustering, under any circumstances, was a
      splendid absurdity. But Tom was very far from feeling it to be so, in his
      excitement; and passed out at the gate with such severe determination
      written in his face that the porter hardly knew him again.
    </p>
    <p>
      It was not until they had walked some short distance, and Tom found
      himself getting cooler and more collected, that he was quite restored to
      himself by an inquiry from his sister, who said in her pleasant little
      voice:
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Where are we going, Tom?&rsquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Dear me!&rsquo; said Tom, stopping, &lsquo;I don&rsquo;t know.&rsquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Don&rsquo;t you&mdash;don&rsquo;t you live anywhere, dear?&rsquo; asked Tom&rsquo;s sister
      looking wistfully in his face.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;No,&rsquo; said Tom. &lsquo;Not at present. Not exactly. I only arrived this morning.
      We must have some lodgings.&rsquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      He didn&rsquo;t tell her that he had been going to stay with his friend John,
      and could on no account think of billeting two inmates upon him, of whom
      one was a young lady; for he knew that would make her uncomfortable, and
      would cause her to regard herself as being an inconvenience to him.
      Neither did he like to leave her anywhere while he called on John, and
      told him of this change in his arrangements; for he was delicate of
      seeming to encroach upon the generous and hospitable nature of his friend.
      Therefore he said again, &lsquo;We must have some lodgings, of course;&rsquo; and said
      it as stoutly as if he had been a perfect Directory and Guide-Book to all
      the lodgings in London.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Where shall we go and look for &lsquo;em?&rsquo; said Tom. &lsquo;What do you think?&rsquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      Tom&rsquo;s sister was not much wiser on such a topic than he was. So she
      squeezed her little purse into his coat-pocket, and folding the little
      hand with which she did so on the other little hand with which she clasped
      his arm, said nothing.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;It ought to be a cheap neighbourhood,&rsquo; said Tom, &lsquo;and not too far from
      London. Let me see. Should you think Islington a good place?&rsquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;I should think it was an excellent place, Tom.&rsquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;It used to be called Merry Islington, once upon a time,&rsquo; said Tom.
      &lsquo;Perhaps it&rsquo;s merry now; if so, it&rsquo;s all the better. Eh?&rsquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;If it&rsquo;s not too dear,&rsquo; said Tom&rsquo;s sister.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Of course, if it&rsquo;s not too dear,&rsquo; assented Tom. &lsquo;Well, where <i>is</i>
      Islington? We can&rsquo;t do better than go there, I should think. Let&rsquo;s go.&rsquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      Tom&rsquo;s sister would have gone anywhere with him; so they walked off, arm in
      arm, as comfortably as possible. Finding, presently, that Islington was
      not in that neighbourhood, Tom made inquiries respecting a public
      conveyance thither; which they soon obtained. As they rode along they were
      very full of conversation indeed, Tom relating what had happened to him,
      and Tom&rsquo;s sister relating what had happened to her, and both finding a
      great deal more to say than time to say it in; for they had only just
      begun to talk, in comparison with what they had to tell each other, when
      they reached their journey&rsquo;s end.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Now,&rsquo; said Tom, &lsquo;we must first look out for some very unpretending
      streets, and then look out for bills in the windows.&rsquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      So they walked off again, quite as happily as if they had just stepped out
      of a snug little house of their own, to look for lodgings on account of
      somebody else. Tom&rsquo;s simplicity was unabated, Heaven knows; but now that
      he had somebody to rely upon him, he was stimulated to rely a little more
      upon himself, and was, in his own opinion, quite a desperate fellow.
    </p>
    <p>
      After roaming up and down for hours, looking at some scores of lodgings,
      they began to find it rather fatiguing, especially as they saw none which
      were at all adapted to their purpose. At length, however, in a singular
      little old-fashioned house, up a blind street, they discovered two small
      bedrooms and a triangular parlour, which promised to suit them well
      enough. Their desiring to take possession immediately was a suspicious
      circumstance, but even this was surmounted by the payment of their first
      week&rsquo;s rent, and a reference to John Westlock, Esquire, Furnival&rsquo;s Inn,
      High Holborn.
    </p>
    <p>
      Ah! It was a goodly sight, when this important point was settled, to
      behold Tom and his sister trotting round to the baker&rsquo;s, and the
      butcher&rsquo;s, and the grocer&rsquo;s, with a kind of dreadful delight in the
      unaccustomed cares of housekeeping; taking secret counsel together as they
      gave their small orders, and distracted by the least suggestion on the
      part of the shopkeeper! When they got back to the triangular parlour, and
      Tom&rsquo;s sister, bustling to and fro, busy about a thousand pleasant
      nothings, stopped every now and then to give old Tom a kiss or smile upon
      him, Tom rubbed his hands as if all Islington were his.
    </p>
    <p>
      It was late in the afternoon now, though, and high time for Tom to keep
      his appointment. So, after agreeing with his sister that in consideration
      of not having dined, they would venture on the extravagance of chops for
      supper at nine, he walked out again to narrate these marvellous
      occurrences to John.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;I am quite a family man all at once,&rsquo; thought Tom. &lsquo;If I can only get
      something to do, how comfortable Ruth and I may be! Ah, that if! But it&rsquo;s
      of no use to despond. I can but do that, when I have tried everything and
      failed; and even then it won&rsquo;t serve me much. Upon my word,&rsquo; thought Tom,
      quickening his pace, &lsquo;I don&rsquo;t know what John will think has become of me.
      He&rsquo;ll begin to be afraid I have strayed into one of those streets where
      the countrymen are murdered; and that I have been made meat pies of, or
      some such horrible thing.&rsquo;

      CHAPTER THIRTY-SEVEN
    </h2>
    <p>
      TOM PINCH, GOING ASTRAY, FINDS THAT HE IS NOT THE ONLY PERSON IN THAT
      PREDICAMENT. HE RETALIATES UPON A FALLEN FOE
    </p>
    <p>
      Tom&rsquo;s evil genius did not lead him into the dens of any of those preparers
      of cannibalic pastry, who are represented in many standard country legends
      as doing a lively retail business in the Metropolis; nor did it mark him
      out as the prey of ring-droppers, pea and thimble-riggers, duffers,
      touters, or any of those bloodless sharpers, who are, perhaps, a little
      better known to the Police. He fell into conversation with no gentleman
      who took him into a public-house, where there happened to be another
      gentleman who swore he had more money than any gentleman, and very soon
      proved he had more money than one gentleman by taking his away from him;
      neither did he fall into any other of the numerous man-traps which are set
      up without notice, in the public grounds of this city. But he lost his
      way. He very soon did that; and in trying to find it again he lost it more
      and more.
    </p>
    <p>
      Now, Tom, in his guileless distrust of London, thought himself very
      knowing in coming to the determination that he would not ask to be
      directed to Furnival&rsquo;s Inn, if he could help it; unless, indeed, he should
      happen to find himself near the Mint, or the Bank of England; in which
      case he would step in, and ask a civil question or two, confiding in the
      perfect respectability of the concern. So on he went, looking up all the
      streets he came near, and going up half of them; and thus, by dint of not
      being true to Goswell Street, and filing off into Aldermanbury, and
      bewildering himself in Barbican, and being constant to the wrong point of
      the compass in London Wall, and then getting himself crosswise into Thames
      Street, by an instinct that would have been marvellous if he had had the
      least desire or reason to go there, he found himself, at last, hard by the
      Monument.
    </p>
    <p>
      The Man in the Monument was quite as mysterious a being to Tom as the Man
      in the Moon. It immediately occurred to him that the lonely creature who
      held himself aloof from all mankind in that pillar like some old hermit
      was the very man of whom to ask his way. Cold, he might be; little
      sympathy he had, perhaps, with human passion&mdash;the column seemed too
      tall for that; but if Truth didn&rsquo;t live in the base of the Monument,
      notwithstanding Pope&rsquo;s couplet about the outside of it, where in London
      (thought Tom) was she likely to be found!
    </p>
    <p>
      Coming close below the pillar, it was a great encouragement to Tom to find
      that the Man in the Monument had simple tastes; that stony and artificial
      as his residence was, he still preserved some rustic recollections; that
      he liked plants, hung up bird-cages, was not wholly cut off from fresh
      groundsel, and kept young trees in tubs. The Man in the Monument, himself,
      was sitting outside the door&mdash;his own door: the Monument-door: what a
      grand idea!&mdash;and was actually yawning, as if there were no Monument
      to stop his mouth, and give him a perpetual interest in his own existence.
    </p>
    <p>
      Tom was advancing towards this remarkable creature, to inquire the way to
      Furnival&rsquo;s Inn, when two people came to see the Monument. They were a
      gentleman and a lady; and the gentleman said, &lsquo;How much a-piece?&rsquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      The Man in the Monument replied, &lsquo;A Tanner.&rsquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      It seemed a low expression, compared with the Monument.
    </p>
    <p>
      The gentleman put a shilling into his hand, and the Man in the Monument
      opened a dark little door. When the gentleman and lady had passed out of
      view, he shut it again, and came slowly back to his chair.
    </p>
    <p>
      He sat down and laughed.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;They don&rsquo;t know what a many steps there is!&rsquo; he said. &lsquo;It&rsquo;s worth twice
      the money to stop here. Oh, my eye!&rsquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      The Man in the Monument was a Cynic; a worldly man! Tom couldn&rsquo;t ask his
      way of <i>him</i>. He was prepared to put no confidence in anything he said.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;My gracious!&rsquo; cried a well-known voice behind Mr Pinch. &lsquo;Why, to be sure
      it is!&rsquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      At the same time he was poked in the back by a parasol. Turning round to
      inquire into this salute, he beheld the eldest daughter of his late
      patron.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Miss Pecksniff!&rsquo; said Tom.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Why, my goodness, Mr Pinch!&rsquo; cried Cherry. &lsquo;What are you doing here?&rsquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;I have rather wandered from my way,&rsquo; said Tom. &lsquo;I&mdash;&rsquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;I hope you have run away,&rsquo; said Charity. &lsquo;It would be quite spirited and
      proper if you had, when my Papa so far forgets himself.&rsquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;I have left him,&rsquo; returned Tom. &lsquo;But it was perfectly understood on both
      sides. It was not done clandestinely.&rsquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Is he married?&rsquo; asked Cherry, with a spasmodic shake of her chin.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;No, not yet,&rsquo; said Tom, colouring; &lsquo;to tell you the truth, I don&rsquo;t think
      he is likely to be, if&mdash;if Miss Graham is the object of his passion.&rsquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Tcha, Mr Pinch!&rsquo; cried Charity, with sharp impatience, &lsquo;you&rsquo;re very
      easily deceived. You don&rsquo;t know the arts of which such a creature is
      capable. Oh! it&rsquo;s a wicked world.&rsquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;You are not married?&rsquo; Tom hinted, to divert the conversation.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;N&mdash;no!&rsquo; said Cherry, tracing out one particular paving-stone in
      Monument Yard with the end of her parasol. &lsquo;I&mdash;but really it&rsquo;s quite
      impossible to explain. Won&rsquo;t you walk in?&rsquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;You live here, then?&rsquo; said Tom
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Yes,&rsquo; returned Miss Pecksniff, pointing with her parasol to Todgers&rsquo;s; &lsquo;I
      reside with this lady, <i>at</i> <i>present</i>.&rsquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      The great stress on the two last words suggested to Tom that he was
      expected to say something in reference to them. So he said.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Only at present! Are you going home again soon?&rsquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;No, Mr Pinch,&rsquo; returned Charity. &lsquo;No, thank you. No! A mother-in-law who
      is younger than&mdash;I mean to say, who is as nearly as possible about
      the same age as one&rsquo;s self, would not quite suit my spirit. Not quite!&rsquo;
      said Cherry, with a spiteful shiver.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;I thought from your saying &ldquo;at present&rdquo;&rsquo;&mdash;Tom observed.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Really, upon my word! I had no idea you would press me so very closely on
      the subject, Mr Pinch,&rsquo; said Charity, blushing, &lsquo;or I should not have been
      so foolish as to allude to&mdash;oh really!&mdash;won&rsquo;t you walk in?&rsquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      Tom mentioned, to excuse himself, that he had an appointment in Furnival&rsquo;s
      Inn, and that coming from Islington he had taken a few wrong turnings, and
      arrived at the Monument instead. Miss Pecksniff simpered very much when he
      asked her if she knew the way to Furnival&rsquo;s Inn, and at length found
      courage to reply.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;A gentleman who is a friend of mine, or at least who is not exactly a
      friend so much as a sort of acquaintance&mdash;Oh upon my word, I hardly
      know what I say, Mr Pinch; you mustn&rsquo;t suppose there is any engagement
      between us; or at least if there is, that it is at all a settled thing as
      yet&mdash;is going to Furnival&rsquo;s Inn immediately, I believe upon a little
      business, and I am sure he would be very glad to accompany you, so as to
      prevent your going wrong again. You had better walk in. You will very
      likely find my sister Merry here,&rsquo; she said with a curious toss of her
      head, and anything but an agreeable smile.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Then, I think, I&rsquo;ll endeavour to find my way alone,&rsquo; said Tom, &lsquo;for I
      fear she would not be very glad to see me. That unfortunate occurrence, in
      relation to which you and I had some amicable words together, in private,
      is not likely to have impressed her with any friendly feeling towards me.
      Though it really was not my fault.&rsquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;She has never heard of that, you may depend,&rsquo; said Cherry, gathering up
      the corners of her mouth, and nodding at Tom. &lsquo;I am far from sure that she
      would bear you any mighty ill will for it, if she had.&rsquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;You don&rsquo;t say so?&rsquo; cried Tom, who was really concerned by this
      insinuation.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;I say nothing,&rsquo; said Charity. &lsquo;If I had not already known what shocking
      things treachery and deceit are in themselves, Mr Pinch, I might perhaps
      have learnt it from the success they meet with&mdash;from the success they
      meet with.&rsquo; Here she smiled as before. &lsquo;But I don&rsquo;t say anything. On the
      contrary, I should scorn it. You had better walk in!&rsquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      There was something hidden here, which piqued Tom&rsquo;s interest and troubled
      his tender heart. When, in a moment&rsquo;s irresolution, he looked at Charity,
      he could not but observe a struggle in her face between a sense of triumph
      and a sense of shame; nor could he but remark how, meeting even his eyes,
      which she cared so little for, she turned away her own, for all the
      splenetic defiance in her manner.
    </p>
    <p>
      An uneasy thought entered Tom&rsquo;s head; a shadowy misgiving that the altered
      relations between himself and Pecksniff were somehow to involve an altered
      knowledge on his part of other people, and were to give him an insight
      into much of which he had had no previous suspicion. And yet he put no
      definite construction upon Charity&rsquo;s proceedings. He certainly had no idea
      that as he had been the audience and spectator of her mortification, she
      grasped with eager delight at any opportunity of reproaching her sister
      with his presence in <i>her </i>far deeper misery; for he knew nothing of it, and
      only pictured that sister as the same giddy, careless, trivial creature
      she always had been, with the same slight estimation of himself which she
      had never been at the least pains to conceal. In short, he had merely a
      confused impression that Miss Pecksniff was not quite sisterly or kind;
      and being curious to set it right, accompanied her as she desired.
    </p>
    <p>
      The house-door being opened, she went in before Tom, requesting him to
      follow her; and led the way to the parlour door.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Oh, Merry!&rsquo; she said, looking in, &lsquo;I am so glad you have not gone home.
      Who do you think I have met in the street, and brought to see you! Mr
      Pinch! There. Now you <i>are </i>surprised, I am sure!&rsquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      Not more surprised than Tom was, when he looked upon her. Not so much. Not
      half so much.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Mr Pinch has left Papa, my dear,&rsquo; said Cherry, &lsquo;and his prospects are
      quite flourishing. I have promised that Augustus, who is going that way,
      shall escort him to the place he wants. Augustus, my child, where are
      you?&rsquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      With these words Miss Pecksniff screamed her way out of the parlour,
      calling on Augustus Moddle to appear; and left Tom Pinch alone with her
      sister.
    </p>
    <p>
      If she had always been his kindest friend; if she had treated him through
      all his servitude with such consideration as was never yet received by
      struggling man; if she had lightened every moment of those many years, and
      had ever spared and never wounded him; his honest heart could not have
      swelled before her with a deeper pity, or a purer freedom from all base
      remembrance than it did then.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;My gracious me! You are really the last person in the world I should have
      thought of seeing, I am sure!&rsquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      Tom was sorry to hear her speaking in her old manner. He had not expected
      that. Yet he did not feel it a contradiction that he should be sorry to
      see her so unlike her old self, and sorry at the same time to hear her
      speaking in her old manner. The two things seemed quite natural.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;I wonder you find any gratification in coming to see me. I can&rsquo;t think
      what put it in your head. I never had much in seeing you. There was no
      love lost between us, Mr Pinch, at any time, I think.&rsquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      Her bonnet lay beside her on the sofa, and she was very busy with the
      ribbons as she spoke. Much too busy to be conscious of the work her
      fingers did.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;We never quarrelled,&rsquo; said Tom.&mdash;Tom was right in that, for one
      person can no more quarrel without an adversary, than one person can play
      at chess, or fight a duel. &lsquo;I hoped you would be glad to shake hands with
      an old friend. Don&rsquo;t let us rake up bygones,&rsquo; said Tom. &lsquo;If I ever
      offended you, forgive me.&rsquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      She looked at him for a moment; dropped her bonnet from her hands; spread
      them before her altered face, and burst into tears.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Oh, Mr Pinch!&rsquo; she said, &lsquo;although I never used you well, I did believe
      your nature was forgiving. I did not think you could be cruel.&rsquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      She spoke as little like her old self now, for certain, as Tom could
      possibly have wished. But she seemed to be appealing to him reproachfully,
      and he did not understand her.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;I seldom showed it&mdash;never&mdash;I know that. But I had that belief
      in you, that if I had been asked to name the person in the world least
      likely to retort upon me, I would have named you, confidently.&rsquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Would have named me!&rsquo; Tom repeated.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Yes,&rsquo; she said with energy, &lsquo;and I have often thought so.&rsquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      After a moment&rsquo;s reflection, Tom sat himself upon a chair beside her.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Do you believe,&rsquo; said Tom, &lsquo;oh, can you think, that what I said just now,
      I said with any but the true and plain intention which my words professed?
      I mean it, in the spirit and the letter. If I ever offended you, forgive
      me; I may have done so, many times. You never injured or offended me. How,
      then, could I possibly retort, if even I were stern and bad enough to wish
      to do it!&rsquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      After a little while she thanked him, through her tears and sobs, and told
      him she had never been at once so sorry and so comforted, since she left
      home. Still she wept bitterly; and it was the greater pain to Tom to see
      her weeping, from her standing in especial need, just then, of sympathy
      and tenderness.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Come, come!&rsquo; said Tom, &lsquo;you used to be as cheerful as the day was long.&rsquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Ah! used!&rsquo; she cried, in such a tone as rent Tom&rsquo;s heart.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;And will be again,&rsquo; said Tom.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;No, never more. No, never, never more. If you should talk with old Mr
      Chuzzlewit, at any time,&rsquo; she added, looking hurriedly into his face&mdash;&lsquo;I
      sometimes thought he liked you, but suppressed it&mdash;will you promise
      me to tell him that you saw me here, and that I said I bore in mind the
      time we talked together in the churchyard?&rsquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      Tom promised that he would.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Many times since then, when I have wished I had been carried there before
      that day, I have recalled his words. I wish that he should know how true
      they were, although the least acknowledgment to that effect has never
      passed my lips and never will.&rsquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      Tom promised this, conditionally too. He did not tell her how improbable
      it was that he and the old man would ever meet again, because he thought
      it might disturb her more.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;If he should ever know this, through your means, dear Mr Pinch,&rsquo; said
      Mercy, &lsquo;tell him that I sent the message, not for myself, but that he
      might be more forbearing and more patient, and more trustful to some other
      person, in some other time of need. Tell him that if he could know how my
      heart trembled in the balance that day, and what a very little would have
      turned the scale, his own would bleed with pity for me.&rsquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Yes, yes,&rsquo; said Tom, &lsquo;I will.&rsquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;When I appeared to him the most unworthy of his help, I was&mdash;I know
      I was, for I have often, often, thought about it since&mdash;the most
      inclined to yield to what he showed me. Oh! if he had relented but a
      little more; if he had thrown himself in my way for but one other quarter
      of an hour; if he had extended his compassion for a vain, unthinking,
      miserable girl, in but the least degree; he might, and I believe he would,
      have saved her! Tell him that I don&rsquo;t blame him, but am grateful for the
      effort that he made; but ask him for the love of God, and youth, and in
      merciful consideration for the struggle which an ill-advised and unwakened
      nature makes to hide the strength it thinks its weakness&mdash;ask him
      never, never, to forget this, when he deals with one again!&rsquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      Although Tom did not hold the clue to her full meaning, he could guess it
      pretty nearly. Touched to the quick, he took her hand and said, or meant
      to say, some words of consolation. She felt and understood them, whether
      they were spoken or no. He was not quite certain, afterwards, but that she
      had tried to kneel down at his feet, and bless him.
    </p>
    <p>
      He found that he was not alone in the room when she had left it. Mrs
      Todgers was there, shaking her head. Tom had never seen Mrs Todgers, it is
      needless to say, but he had a perception of her being the lady of the
      house; and he saw some genuine compassion in her eyes, that won his good
      opinion.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Ah, sir! You are an old friend, I see,&rsquo; said Mrs Todgers.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Yes,&rsquo; said Tom.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;And yet,&rsquo; quoth Mrs Todgers, shutting the door softly, &lsquo;she hasn&rsquo;t told
      you what her troubles are, I&rsquo;m certain.&rsquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      Tom was struck by these words, for they were quite true. &lsquo;Indeed,&rsquo; he
      said, &lsquo;she has not.&rsquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;And never would,&rsquo; said Mrs Todgers, &lsquo;if you saw her daily. She never
      makes the least complaint to me, or utters a single word of explanation or
      reproach. But I know,&rsquo; said Mrs Todgers, drawing in her breath, &lsquo;I know!&rsquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      Tom nodded sorrowfully, &lsquo;So do I.&rsquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;I fully believe,&rsquo; said Mrs Todgers, taking her pocket-handkerchief from
      the flat reticule, &lsquo;that nobody can tell one half of what that poor young
      creature has to undergo. But though she comes here, constantly, to ease
      her poor full heart without his knowing it; and saying, &ldquo;Mrs Todgers, I am
      very low to-day; I think that I shall soon be dead,&rdquo; sits crying in my
      room until the fit is past; I know no more from her. And, I believe,&rsquo; said
      Mrs Todgers, putting back her handkerchief again, &lsquo;that she considers me a
      good friend too.&rsquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      Mrs Todgers might have said her best friend. Commercial gentlemen and
      gravy had tried Mrs Todgers&rsquo;s temper; the main chance&mdash;it was such a
      very small one in her case, that she might have been excused for looking
      sharp after it, lest it should entirely vanish from her sight&mdash;had
      taken a firm hold on Mrs Todgers&rsquo;s attention. But in some odd nook in Mrs
      Todgers&rsquo;s breast, up a great many steps, and in a corner easy to be
      overlooked, there was a secret door, with &lsquo;Woman&rsquo; written on the spring,
      which, at a touch from Mercy&rsquo;s hand, had flown wide open, and admitted her
      for shelter.
    </p>
    <p>
      When boarding-house accounts are balanced with all other ledgers, and the
      books of the Recording Angel are made up for ever, perhaps there may be
      seen an entry to thy credit, lean Mrs Todgers, which shall make thee
      beautiful!
    </p>
    <p>
      She was growing beautiful so rapidly in Tom&rsquo;s eyes; for he saw that she
      was poor, and that this good had sprung up in her from among the sordid
      strivings of her life; that she might have been a very Venus in a minute
      more, if Miss Pecksniff had not entered with her friend.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Mr Thomas Pinch!&rsquo; said Charity, performing the ceremony of introduction
      with evident pride. &lsquo;Mr Moddle. Where&rsquo;s my sister?&rsquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Gone, Miss Pecksniff,&rsquo; Mrs Todgers answered. &lsquo;She had appointed to be
      home.&rsquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Ah!&rsquo; said Charity, looking at Tom. &lsquo;Oh, dear me!&rsquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;She&rsquo;s greatly altered since she&rsquo;s been Anoth&mdash;since she&rsquo;s been
      married, Mrs Todgers!&rsquo; observed Moddle.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;My dear Augustus!&rsquo; said Miss Pecksniff, in a low voice. &lsquo;I verily believe
      you have said that fifty thousand times, in my hearing. What a Prose you
      are!&rsquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      This was succeeded by some trifling love passages, which appeared to
      originate with, if not to be wholly carried on by Miss Pecksniff. At any
      rate, Mr Moddle was much slower in his responses than is customary with
      young lovers, and exhibited a lowness of spirits which was quite
      oppressive.
    </p>
    <p>
      He did not improve at all when Tom and he were in the streets, but sighed
      so dismally that it was dreadful to hear him. As a means of cheering him
      up, Tom told him that he wished him joy.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Joy!&rsquo; cried Moddle. &lsquo;Ha, ha!&rsquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;What an extraordinary young man!&rsquo; thought Tom.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;The Scorner has not set his seal upon you. <i>you </i>care what becomes of you?&rsquo;
      said Moddle.
    </p>
    <p>
      Tom admitted that it was a subject in which he certainly felt some
      interest.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;I don&rsquo;t,&rsquo; said Mr Moddle. &lsquo;The Elements may have me when they please. I&rsquo;m
      ready.&rsquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      Tom inferred from these, and other expressions of the same nature, that he
      was jealous. Therefore he allowed him to take his own course; which was
      such a gloomy one, that he felt a load removed from his mind when they
      parted company at the gate of Furnival&rsquo;s Inn.
    </p>
    <p>
      It was now a couple of hours past John Westlock&rsquo;s dinner-time; and he was
      walking up and down the room, quite anxious for Tom&rsquo;s safety. The table
      was spread; the wine was carefully decanted; and the dinner smelt
      delicious.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Why, Tom, old boy, where on earth have you been? Your box is here. Get
      your boots off instantly, and sit down!&rsquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;I am sorry to say I can&rsquo;t stay, John,&rsquo; replied Tom Pinch, who was
      breathless with the haste he had made in running up the stairs.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Can&rsquo;t stay!&rsquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;If you&rsquo;ll go on with your dinner,&rsquo; said Tom, &lsquo;I&rsquo;ll tell you my reason the
      while. I mustn&rsquo;t eat myself, or I shall have no appetite for the chops.&rsquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;There are no chops here, my food fellow.&rsquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;No. But there are at Islington,&rsquo; said Tom.
    </p>
    <p>
      John Westlock was perfectly confounded by this reply, and vowed he would
      not touch a morsel until Tom had explained himself fully. So Tom sat down,
      and told him all; to which he listened with the greatest interest.
    </p>
    <p>
      He knew Tom too well, and respected his delicacy too much, to ask him why
      he had taken these measures without communicating with him first. He quite
      concurred in the expediency of Tom&rsquo;s immediately returning to his sister,
      as he knew so little of the place in which he had left her, and
      good-humouredly proposed to ride back with him in a cab, in which he might
      convey his box. Tom&rsquo;s proposition that he should sup with them that night,
      he flatly rejected, but made an appointment with him for the morrow. &lsquo;And
      now Tom,&rsquo; he said, as they rode along, &lsquo;I have a question to ask you to
      which I expect a manly and straightforward answer. Do you want any money?
      I am pretty sure you do.&rsquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;I don&rsquo;t indeed,&rsquo; said Tom.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;I believe you are deceiving me.&rsquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;No. With many thanks to you, I am quite in earnest,&rsquo; Tom replied. &lsquo;My
      sister has some money, and so have I. If I had nothing else, John, I have
      a five-pound note, which that good creature, Mrs Lupin, of the Dragon,
      handed up to me outside the coach, in a letter begging me to borrow it;
      and then drove off as hard as she could go.&rsquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;And a blessing on every dimple in her handsome face, say I!&rsquo; cried John,
      &lsquo;though why you should give her the preference over me, I don&rsquo;t know.
      Never mind. I bide my time, Tom.&rsquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;And I hope you&rsquo;ll continue to bide it,&rsquo; returned Tom, gayly. &lsquo;For I owe
      you more, already, in a hundred other ways, than I can ever hope to pay.&rsquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      They parted at the door of Tom&rsquo;s new residence. John Westlock, sitting in
      the cab, and, catching a glimpse of a blooming little busy creature
      darting out to kiss Tom and to help him with his box, would not have had
      the least objection to change places with him.
    </p>
    <p>
      Well! she <i>was </i>a cheerful little thing; and had a quaint, bright quietness
      about her that was infinitely pleasant. Surely she was the best sauce for
      chops ever invented. The potatoes seemed to take a pleasure in sending up
      their grateful steam before her; the froth upon the pint of porter pouted
      to attract her notice. But it was all in vain. She saw nothing but Tom.
      Tom was the first and last thing in the world.
    </p>
    <p>
      As she sat opposite to Tom at supper, fingering one of Tom&rsquo;s pet tunes
      upon the table-cloth, and smiling in his face, he had never been so happy
      in his life.

    <h2>
      CHAPTER THIRTY-EIGHT
    </h2>
    <h3>
      SECRET SERVICE
    </h3>
    <p>
      In walking from the city with his sentimental friend, Tom Pinch had looked
      into the face, and brushed against the threadbare sleeve, of Mr Nadgett,
      man of mystery to the Anglo-Bengalee Disinterested Loan and Life Assurance
      Company. Mr Nadgett naturally passed away from Tom&rsquo;s remembrance as he
      passed out of his view; for he didn&rsquo;t know him, and had never heard his
      name.
    </p>
    <p>
      As there are a vast number of people in the huge metropolis of England who
      rise up every morning not knowing where their heads will rest at night, so
      there are a multitude who shooting arrows over houses as their daily
      business, never know on whom they fall. Mr Nadgett might have passed Tom
      Pinch ten thousand times; might even have been quite familiar with his
      face, his name, pursuits, and character; yet never once have dreamed that
      Tom had any interest in any act or mystery of his. Tom might have done the
      like by him of course. But the same private man out of all the men alive,
      was in the mind of each at the same moment; was prominently connected
      though in a different manner, with the day&rsquo;s adventures of both; and
      formed, when they passed each other in the street, the one absorbing topic
      of their thoughts.
    </p>
    <p>
      Why Tom had Jonas Chuzzlewit in his mind requires no explanation. Why Mr
      Nadgett should have had Jonas Chuzzlewit in his, is quite another thing.
    </p>
    <p>
      But, somehow or other, that amiable and worthy orphan had become a part of
      the mystery of Mr Nadgett&rsquo;s existence. Mr Nadgett took an interest in his
      lightest proceedings; and it never flagged or wavered. He watched him in
      and out of the Assurance Office, where he was now formally installed as a
      Director; he dogged his footsteps in the streets; he stood listening when
      he talked; he sat in coffee-rooms entering his name in the great
      pocket-book, over and over again; he wrote letters to himself about him
      constantly; and, when he found them in his pocket, put them in the fire,
      with such distrust and caution that he would bend down to watch the
      crumpled tinder while it floated upwards, as if his mind misgave him, that
      the mystery it had contained might come out at the chimney-pot.
    </p>
    <p>
      And yet all this was quite a secret. Mr Nadgett kept it to himself, and
      kept it close. Jonas had no more idea that Mr Nadgett&rsquo;s eyes were fixed on
      him, than he had that he was living under the daily inspection and report
      of a whole order of Jesuits. Indeed Mr Nadgett&rsquo;s eyes were seldom fixed on
      any other objects than the ground, the clock, or the fire; but every
      button on his coat might have been an eye, he saw so much.
    </p>
    <p>
      The secret manner of the man disarmed suspicion in this wise; suggesting,
      not that he was watching any one, but that he thought some other man was
      watching him. He went about so stealthily, and kept himself so wrapped up
      in himself, that the whole object of his life appeared to be, to avoid
      notice and preserve his own mystery. Jonas sometimes saw him in the
      street, hovering in the outer office, waiting at the door for the man who
      never came, or slinking off with his immovable face and drooping head, and
      the one beaver glove dangling before him; but he would as soon have
      thought of the cross upon the top of St. Paul&rsquo;s Cathedral taking note of
      what he did, or slowly winding a great net about his feet, as of Nadgett&rsquo;s
      being engaged in such an occupation.
    </p>
    <p>
      Mr Nadgett made a mysterious change about this time in his mysterious
      life: for whereas he had, until now, been first seen every morning coming
      down Cornhill, so exactly like the Nadgett of the day before as to
      occasion a popular belief that he never went to bed or took his clothes
      off, he was now first seen in Holborn, coming out of Kingsgate Street; and
      it was soon discovered that he actually went every morning to a barber&rsquo;s
      shop in that street to get shaved; and that the barber&rsquo;s name was
      Sweedlepipe. He seemed to make appointments with the man who never came,
      to meet him at this barber&rsquo;s; for he would frequently take long spells of
      waiting in the shop, and would ask for pen and ink, and pull out his
      pocket-book, and be very busy over it for an hour at a time. Mrs Gamp and
      Mr Sweedlepipe had many deep discoursings on the subject of this
      mysterious customer; but they usually agreed that he had speculated too
      much and was keeping out of the way.
    </p>
    <p>
      He must have appointed the man who never kept his word, to meet him at
      another new place too; for one day he was found, for the first time, by
      the waiter at the Mourning Coach-Horse, the House-of-call for Undertakers,
      down in the City there, making figures with a pipe-stem in the sawdust of
      a clean spittoon; and declining to call for anything, on the ground of
      expecting a gentleman presently. As the gentleman was not honourable
      enough to keep his engagement, he came again next day, with his
      pocket-book in such a state of distention that he was regarded in the bar
      as a man of large property. After that, he repeated his visits every day,
      and had so much writing to do, that he made nothing of emptying a
      capacious leaden inkstand in two sittings. Although he never talked much,
      still, by being there among the regular customers, he made their
      acquaintance, and in course of time became quite intimate with Mr Tacker,
      Mr Mould&rsquo;s foreman; and even with Mr Mould himself, who openly said he was
      a long-headed man, a dry one, a salt fish, a deep file, a rasper; and made
      him the subject of many other flattering encomiums.
    </p>
    <p>
      At the same time, too, he told the people at the Assurance Office, in his
      own mysterious way, that there was something wrong (secretly wrong, of
      course) in his liver, and that he feared he must put himself under the
      doctor&rsquo;s hands. He was delivered over to Jobling upon this representation;
      and though Jobling could not find out where his liver was wrong, wrong Mr
      Nadgett said it was; observing that it was his own liver, and he hoped he
      ought to know. Accordingly, he became Mr Jobling&rsquo;s patient; and detailing
      his symptoms in his slow and secret way, was in and out of that
      gentleman&rsquo;s room a dozen times a day.
    </p>
    <p>
      As he pursued all these occupations at once; and all steadily; and all
      secretly; and never slackened in his watchfulness of everything that Mr
      Jonas said and did, and left unsaid and undone; it is not improbable that
      they were, secretly, essential parts of some great scheme which Mr Nadgett
      had on foot.
    </p>
    <p>
      It was on the morning of this very day on which so much had happened to
      Tom Pinch, that Nadgett suddenly appeared before Mr Montague&rsquo;s house in
      Pall Mall&mdash;he always made his appearance as if he had that moment
      come up a trap&mdash;when the clocks were striking nine. He rang the bell
      in a covert under-handed way, as though it were a treasonable act; and
      passed in at the door, the moment it was opened wide enough to receive his
      body. That done, he shut it immediately with his own hands.
    </p>
    <p>
      Mr Bailey, taking up his name without delay, returned with a request that
      he would follow him into his master&rsquo;s chamber. The chairman of the
      Anglo-Bengalee Disinterested Loan and Life Assurance Board was dressing,
      and received him as a business person who was often backwards and
      forwards, and was received at all times for his business&rsquo; sake.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Well, Mr Nadgett?&rsquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      Mr Nadgett put his hat upon the ground and coughed. The boy having
      withdrawn and shut the door, he went to it softly, examined the handle,
      and returned to within a pace or two of the chair in which Mr Montague
      sat.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Any news, Mr Nadgett?&rsquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;I think we have some news at last, sir.&rsquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;I am happy to hear it. I began to fear you were off the scent, Mr
      Nadgett.&rsquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;No, sir. It grows cold occasionally. It will sometimes. We can&rsquo;t help
      that.&rsquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;You are truth itself, Mr Nadgett. Do you report a great success?&rsquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;That depends upon your judgment and construction of it,&rsquo; was his answer,
      as he put on his spectacles.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;What do you think of it yourself? Have you pleased yourself?&rsquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      Mr Nadgett rubbed his hands slowly, stroked his chin, looked round the
      room, and said, &lsquo;Yes, yes, I think it&rsquo;s a good case. I am disposed to
      think it&rsquo;s a good case. Will you go into it at once?&rsquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;By all means.&rsquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      Mr Nadgett picked out a certain chair from among the rest, and having
      planted it in a particular spot, as carefully as if he had been going to
      vault over it, placed another chair in front of it; leaving room for his
      own legs between them. He then sat down in chair number two, and laid his
      pocket-book, very carefully, on chair number one. He then untied the
      pocket-book, and hung the string over the back of chair number one. He
      then drew both the chairs a little nearer Mr Montague, and opening the
      pocket-book spread out its contents. Finally he selected a certain
      memorandum from the rest, and held it out to his employer, who, during the
      whole of these preliminary ceremonies, had been making violent efforts to
      conceal his impatience.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;I wish you wouldn&rsquo;t be so fond of making notes, my excellent friend,&rsquo;
      said Tigg Montague with a ghastly smile. &lsquo;I wish you would consent to give
      me their purport by word of mouth.&rsquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;I don&rsquo;t like word of mouth,&rsquo; said Mr Nadgett gravely. &lsquo;We never know
      who&rsquo;s listening.&rsquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      Mr Montague was going to retort, when Nadgett handed him the paper, and
      said, with quiet exultation in his tone, &lsquo;We&rsquo;ll begin at the beginning,
      and take that one first, if you please, sir.&rsquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      The chairman cast his eyes upon it, coldly, and with a smile which did not
      render any great homage to the slow and methodical habits of his spy. But
      he had not read half-a-dozen lines when the expression of his face began
      to change, and before he had finished the perusal of the paper, it was
      full of grave and serious attention.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Number Two,&rsquo; said Mr Nadgett, handing him another, and receiving back the
      first. &lsquo;Read Number Two, sir, if you please. There is more interest as you
      go on.&rsquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      Tigg Montague leaned backward in his chair, and cast upon his emissary
      such a look of vacant wonder (not unmingled with alarm), that Mr Nadgett
      considered it necessary to repeat the request he had already twice
      preferred; with the view to recalling his attention to the point in hand.
      Profiting by the hint, Mr Montague went on with Number Two, and afterwards
      with Numbers Three, and Four, and Five, and so on.
    </p>
    <p>
      These documents were all in Mr Nadgett&rsquo;s writing, and were apparently a
      series of memoranda, jotted down from time to time upon the backs of old
      letters, or any scrap of paper that came first to hand. Loose straggling
      scrawls they were, and of very uninviting exterior; but they had weighty
      purpose in them, if the chairman&rsquo;s face were any index to the character of
      their contents.
    </p>
    <p>
      The progress of Mr Nadgett&rsquo;s secret satisfaction arising out of the effect
      they made, kept pace with the emotions of the reader. At first, Mr Nadgett
      sat with his spectacles low down upon his nose, looking over them at his
      employer, and nervously rubbing his hands. After a little while, he
      changed his posture in his chair for one of greater ease, and leisurely
      perused the next document he held ready as if an occasional glance at his
      employer&rsquo;s face were now enough and all occasion for anxiety or doubt were
      gone. And finally he rose and looked out of the window, where he stood
      with a triumphant air until Tigg Montague had finished.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;And this is the last, Mr Nadgett!&rsquo; said that gentleman, drawing a long
      breath.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;That, sir, is the last.&rsquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;You are a wonderful man, Mr Nadgett!&rsquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;I think it is a pretty good case,&rsquo; he returned as he gathered up his
      papers. &lsquo;It cost some trouble, sir.&rsquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;The trouble shall be well rewarded, Mr Nadgett.&rsquo; Nadgett bowed. &lsquo;There is
      a deeper impression of Somebody&rsquo;s Hoof here, than I had expected, Mr
      Nadgett. I may congratulate myself upon your being such a good hand at a
      secret.&rsquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Oh! nothing has an interest to me that&rsquo;s not a secret,&rsquo; replied Nadgett,
      as he tied the string about his pocket-book, and put it up. &lsquo;It always
      takes away any pleasure I may have had in this inquiry even to make it
      known to you.&rsquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;A most invaluable constitution,&rsquo; Tigg retorted. &lsquo;A great gift for a
      gentleman employed as you are, Mr Nadgett. Much better than discretion;
      though you possess that quality also in an eminent degree. I think I heard
      a double knock. Will you put your head out of window, and tell me whether
      there is anybody at the door?&rsquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      Mr Nadgett softly raised the sash, and peered out from the very corner, as
      a man might who was looking down into a street from whence a brisk
      discharge of musketry might be expected at any moment. Drawing in his head
      with equal caution, he observed, not altering his voice or manner:
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Mr Jonas Chuzzlewit!&rsquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;I thought so,&rsquo; Tigg retorted.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Shall I go?&rsquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;I think you had better. Stay though! No! remain here, Mr Nadgett, if you
      please.&rsquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      It was remarkable how pale and flurried he had become in an instant. There
      was nothing to account for it. His eye had fallen on his razors; but what
      of them!
    </p>
    <p>
      Mr Chuzzlewit was announced.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Show him up directly. Nadgett! don&rsquo;t you leave us alone together. Mind
      you don&rsquo;t, now! By the Lord!&rsquo; he added in a whisper to himself: &lsquo;We don&rsquo;t
      know what may happen.&rsquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      Saying this, he hurriedly took up a couple of hair-brushes, and began to
      exercise them on his own head, as if his toilet had not been interrupted.
      Mr Nadgett withdrew to the stove, in which there was a small fire for the
      convenience of heating curling-irons; and taking advantage of so
      favourable an opportunity for drying his pocket-handkerchief, produced it
      without loss of time. There he stood, during the whole interview, holding
      it before the bars, and sometimes, but not often, glancing over his
      shoulder.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;My dear Chuzzlewit!&rsquo; cried Montague, as Jonas entered. &lsquo;You rise with the
      lark. Though you go to bed with the nightingale, you rise with the lark.
      You have superhuman energy, my dear Chuzzlewit!&rsquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Ecod!&rsquo; said Jonas, with an air of langour and ill-humour, as he took a
      chair, &lsquo;I should be very glad not to get up with the lark, if I could help
      it. But I am a light sleeper; and it&rsquo;s better to be up than lying awake,
      counting the dismal old church-clocks, in bed.&rsquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;A light sleeper!&rsquo; cried his friend. &lsquo;Now, what is a light sleeper? I
      often hear the expression, but upon my life I have not the least
      conception what a light sleeper is.&rsquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Hallo!&rsquo; said Jonas, &lsquo;Who&rsquo;s that? Oh, old what&rsquo;s-his-name: looking (as
      usual) as if he wanted to skulk up the chimney.&rsquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Ha, ha! I have no doubt he does.&rsquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Well! He&rsquo;s not wanted here, I suppose,&rsquo; said Jonas. &lsquo;He may go, mayn&rsquo;t
      he?&rsquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Oh, let him stay, let him stay!&rsquo; said Tigg. &lsquo;He&rsquo;s a mere piece of
      furniture. He has been making his report, and is waiting for further
      orders. He has been told,&rsquo; said Tigg, raising his voice, &lsquo;not to lose
      sight of certain friends of ours, or to think that he has done with them
      by any means. He understands his business.&rsquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;He need,&rsquo; replied Jonas; &lsquo;for of all the precious old dummies in
      appearance that I ever saw, he&rsquo;s about the worst. He&rsquo;s afraid of me, I
      think.&rsquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;It&rsquo;s my belief,&rsquo; said Tigg, &lsquo;that you are Poison to him. Nadgett! give me
      that towel!&rsquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      He had as little occasion for a towel as Jonas had for a start. But
      Nadgett brought it quickly; and, having lingered for a moment, fell back
      upon his old post by the fire.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;You see, my dear fellow,&rsquo; resumed Tigg, &lsquo;you are too&mdash;what&rsquo;s the
      matter with your lips? How white they are!&rsquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;I took some vinegar just now,&rsquo; said Jonas. &lsquo;I had oysters for my
      breakfast. Where are they white?&rsquo; he added, muttering an oath, and rubbing
      them upon his handkerchief. &lsquo;I don&rsquo;t believe they <i>are </i>white.&rsquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Now I look again, they are not,&rsquo; replied his friend. &lsquo;They are coming
      right again.&rsquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Say what you were going to say,&rsquo; cried Jonas angrily, &lsquo;and let my face
      be! As long as I can show my teeth when I want to (and I can do that
      pretty well), the colour of my lips is not material.&rsquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Quite true,&rsquo; said Tigg. &lsquo;I was only going to say that you are too quick
      and active for our friend. He is too shy to cope with such a man as you,
      but does his duty well. Oh, very well! But what is a light sleeper?&rsquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Hang a light sleeper!&rsquo; exclaimed Jonas pettishly.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;No, no,&rsquo; interrupted Tigg. &lsquo;No. We&rsquo;ll not do that.&rsquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;A light sleeper ain&rsquo;t a heavy one,&rsquo; said Jonas in his sulky way; &lsquo;don&rsquo;t
      sleep much, and don&rsquo;t sleep well, and don&rsquo;t sleep sound.&rsquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;And dreams,&rsquo; said Tigg, &lsquo;and cries out in an ugly manner; and when the
      candle burns down in the night, is in an agony; and all that sort of
      thing. I see!&rsquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      They were silent for a little time. Then Jonas spoke:
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Now we&rsquo;ve done with child&rsquo;s talk, I want to have a word with you. I want
      to have a word with you before we meet up yonder to-day. I am not
      satisfied with the state of affairs.&rsquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Not satisfied!&rsquo; cried Tigg. &lsquo;The money comes in well.&rsquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;The money comes in well enough,&rsquo; retorted Jonas, &lsquo;but it don&rsquo;t come out
      well enough. It can&rsquo;t be got at easily enough. I haven&rsquo;t sufficient power;
      it is all in your hands. Ecod! what with one of your by-laws, and another
      of your by-laws, and your votes in this capacity, and your votes in that
      capacity, and your official rights, and your individual rights, and other
      people&rsquo;s rights who are only you again, there are no rights left for me.
      Everybody else&rsquo;s rights are my wrongs. What&rsquo;s the use of my having a voice
      if it&rsquo;s always drowned? I might as well be dumb, and it would be much less
      aggravating. I&rsquo;m not a-going to stand that, you know.&rsquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;No!&rsquo; said Tigg in an insinuating tone.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;No!&rsquo; returned Jonas, &lsquo;I&rsquo;m not indeed. I&rsquo;ll play old Gooseberry with the
      office, and make you glad to buy me out at a good high figure, if you try
      any of your tricks with me.&rsquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;I give you my honour&mdash;&rsquo; Montague began.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Oh! confound your honour,&rsquo; interrupted Jonas, who became more coarse and
      quarrelsome as the other remonstrated, which may have been a part of Mr
      Montague&rsquo;s intention; &lsquo;I want a little more control over the money. You
      may have all the honour, if you like; I&rsquo;ll never bring you to book for
      that. But I&rsquo;m not a-going to stand it, as it is now. If you should take it
      into your honourable head to go abroad with the bank, I don&rsquo;t see much to
      prevent you. Well! That won&rsquo;t do. I&rsquo;ve had some very good dinners here,
      but they&rsquo;d come too dear on such terms; and therefore, that won&rsquo;t do.&rsquo;

    <p>
      &lsquo;I am unfortunate to find you in this humour,&rsquo; said Tigg, with a
      remarkable kind of smile; &lsquo;for I was going to propose to you&mdash;for
      your own advantage; solely for your own advantage&mdash;that you should
      venture a little more with us.&rsquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Was you, by G&mdash;?&rsquo; said Jonas, with a short laugh.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Yes. And to suggest,&rsquo; pursued Montague, &lsquo;that surely you have friends;
      indeed, I know you have; who would answer our purpose admirably, and whom
      we should be delighted to receive.&rsquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;How kind of you! You&rsquo;d be delighted to receive &lsquo;em, would you?&rsquo; said
      Jonas, bantering.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;I give you my sacred honour, quite transported. As your friends,
      observe!&rsquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Exactly,&rsquo; said Jonas; &lsquo;as my friends, of course. You&rsquo;ll be very much
      delighted when you get &lsquo;em, I have no doubt. And it&rsquo;ll be all to my
      advantage, won&rsquo;t it?&rsquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;It will be very much to your advantage,&rsquo; answered Montague poising a
      brush in each hand, and looking steadily upon him. &lsquo;It will be very much
      to your advantage, I assure you.&rsquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;And you can tell me how,&rsquo; said Jonas, &lsquo;can&rsquo;t you?&rsquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;<i>Shall </i>I tell you how?&rsquo; returned the other.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;I think you had better,&rsquo; said Jonas. &lsquo;Strange things have been done in
      the Assurance way before now, by strange sorts of men, and I mean to take
      care of myself.&rsquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Chuzzlewit!&rsquo; replied Montague, leaning forward, with his arms upon his
      knees, and looking full into his face. &lsquo;Strange things have been done, and
      are done every day; not only in our way, but in a variety of other ways;
      and no one suspects them. But ours, as you say, my good friend, is a
      strange way; and we strangely happen, sometimes, to come into the
      knowledge of very strange events.&rsquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      He beckoned to Jonas to bring his chair nearer; and looking slightly
      round, as if to remind him of the presence of Nadgett, whispered in his
      ear.
    </p>
    <p>
      From red to white; from white to red again; from red to yellow; then to a
      cold, dull, awful, sweat-bedabbled blue. In that short whisper, all these
      changes fell upon the face of Jonas Chuzzlewit; and when at last he laid
      his hand upon the whisperer&rsquo;s mouth, appalled, lest any syllable of what
      he said should reach the ears of the third person present, it was as
      bloodless and as heavy as the hand of Death.
    </p>
    <p>
      He drew his chair away, and sat a spectacle of terror, misery, and rage.
      He was afraid to speak, or look, or move, or sit still. Abject, crouching,
      and miserable, he was a greater degradation to the form he bore, than if
      he had been a loathsome wound from head to heel.
    </p>
    <p>
      His companion leisurely resumed his dressing, and completed it, glancing
      sometimes with a smile at the transformation he had effected, but never
      speaking once.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;You&rsquo;ll not object,&rsquo; he said, when he was quite equipped, &lsquo;to venture
      further with us, Chuzzlewit, my friend?&rsquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      His pale lips faintly stammered out a &lsquo;No.&rsquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Well said! That&rsquo;s like yourself. Do you know I was thinking yesterday
      that your father-in-law, relying on your advice as a man of great sagacity
      in money matters, as no doubt you are, would join us, if the thing were
      well presented to him. He has money?&rsquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Yes, he has money.&rsquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Shall I leave Mr Pecksniff to you? Will you undertake for Mr Pecksniff.&rsquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;I&rsquo;ll try. I&rsquo;ll do my best.&rsquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;A thousand thanks,&rsquo; replied the other, clapping him upon the shoulder.
      &lsquo;Shall we walk downstairs? Mr Nadgett! Follow us, if you please.&rsquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      They went down in that order. Whatever Jonas felt in reference to
      Montague; whatever sense he had of being caged, and barred, and trapped,
      and having fallen down into a pit of deepest ruin; whatever thoughts came
      crowding on his mind even at that early time, of one terrible chance of
      escape, of one red glimmer in a sky of blackness; he no more thought that
      the slinking figure half-a-dozen stairs behind him was his pursuing Fate,
      than that the other figure at his side was his Good Angel.

    <h2>
      CHAPTER THIRTY-NINE
    </h2>
    <p>
      CONTAINING SOME FURTHER PARTICULARS OF THE DOMESTIC ECONOMY OF THE
      PINCHES; WITH STRANGE NEWS FROM THE CITY, NARROWLY CONCERNING TOM
    </p>
    <p>
      Pleasant little Ruth! Cheerful, tidy, bustling, quiet little Ruth! No
      doll&rsquo;s house ever yielded greater delight to its young mistress, than
      little Ruth derived from her glorious dominion over the triangular parlour
      and the two small bedrooms.
    </p>
    <p>
      To be Tom&rsquo;s housekeeper. What dignity! Housekeeping, upon the commonest
      terms, associated itself with elevated responsibilities of all sorts and
      kinds; but housekeeping for Tom implied the utmost complication of grave
      trusts and mighty charges. Well might she take the keys out of the little
      chiffonier which held the tea and sugar; and out of the two little damp
      cupboards down by the fireplace, where the very black beetles got mouldy,
      and had the shine taken out of their backs by envious mildew; and jingle
      them upon a ring before Tom&rsquo;s eyes when he came down to breakfast! Well
      might she, laughing musically, put them up in that blessed little pocket
      of hers with a merry pride! For it was such a grand novelty to be mistress
      of anything, that if she had been the most relentless and despotic of all
      little housekeepers, she might have pleaded just that much for her excuse,
      and have been honourably acquitted.
    </p>
    <p>
      So far from being despotic, however, there was a coyness about her very
      way of pouring out the tea, which Tom quite revelled in. And when she
      asked him what he would like to have for dinner, and faltered out &lsquo;chops&rsquo;
      as a reasonably good suggestion after their last night&rsquo;s successful
      supper, Tom grew quite facetious, and rallied her desperately.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;I don&rsquo;t know, Tom,&rsquo; said his sister, blushing, &lsquo;I am not quite confident,
      but I think I could make a beef-steak pudding, if I tried, Tom.&rsquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;In the whole catalogue of cookery, there is nothing I should like so much
      as a beef-steak pudding!&rsquo; cried Tom, slapping his leg to give the greater
      force to this reply.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Yes, dear, that&rsquo;s excellent! But if it should happen not to come quite
      right the first time,&rsquo; his sister faltered; &lsquo;if it should happen not to be
      a pudding exactly, but should turn out a stew, or a soup, or something of
      that sort, you&rsquo;ll not be vexed, Tom, will you?&rsquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      The serious way in which she looked at Tom; the way in which Tom looked at
      her; and the way in which she gradually broke into a merry laugh at her
      own expense, would have enchanted you.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Why,&rsquo; said Tom &lsquo;this is capital. It gives us a new, and quite an uncommon
      interest in the dinner. We put into a lottery for a beefsteak pudding, and
      it is impossible to say what we may get. We may make some wonderful
      discovery, perhaps, and produce such a dish as never was known before.&rsquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;I shall not be at all surprised if we do, Tom,&rsquo; returned his sister,
      still laughing merrily, &lsquo;or if it should prove to be such a dish as we
      shall not feel very anxious to produce again; but the meat must come out
      of the saucepan at last, somehow or other, you know. We can&rsquo;t cook it into
      nothing at all; that&rsquo;s a great comfort. So if you like to venture, I
      will.&rsquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;I have not the least doubt,&rsquo; rejoined Tom, &lsquo;that it will come out an
      excellent pudding, or at all events, I am sure that I shall think it so.
      There is naturally something so handy and brisk about you, Ruth, that if
      you said you could make a bowl of faultless turtle soup, I should believe
      you.&rsquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      And Tom was right. She was precisely that sort of person. Nobody ought to
      have been able to resist her coaxing manner; and nobody had any business
      to try. Yet she never seemed to know it was her manner at all. That was
      the best of it.
    </p>
    <p>
      Well! she washed up the breakfast cups, chatting away the whole time, and
      telling Tom all sorts of anecdotes about the brass-and-copper founder; put
      everything in its place; made the room as neat as herself;&mdash;you must
      not suppose its shape was half as neat as hers though, or anything like it&mdash;and
      brushed Tom&rsquo;s old hat round and round and round again, until it was as
      sleek as Mr Pecksniff. Then she discovered, all in a moment, that Tom&rsquo;s
      shirt-collar was frayed at the edge; and flying upstairs for a needle and
      thread, came flying down again with her thimble on, and set it right with
      wonderful expertness; never once sticking the needle into his face,
      although she was humming his pet tune from first to last, and beating time
      with the fingers of her left hand upon his neckcloth. She had no sooner
      done this, than off she was again; and there she stood once more, as brisk
      and busy as a bee, tying that compact little chin of hers into an equally
      compact little bonnet; intent on bustling out to the butcher&rsquo;s, without a
      minute&rsquo;s loss of time; and inviting Tom to come and see the steak cut,
      with his own eyes. As to Tom, he was ready to go anywhere; so off they
      trotted, arm-in-arm, as nimbly as you please; saying to each other what a
      quiet street it was to lodge in, and how very cheap, and what an airy
      situation.
    </p>
    <p>
      To see the butcher slap the steak, before he laid it on the block, and
      give his knife a sharpening, was to forget breakfast instantly. It was
      agreeable, too&mdash;it really was&mdash;to see him cut it off, so smooth
      and juicy. There was nothing savage in the act, although the knife was
      large and keen; it was a piece of art, high art; there was delicacy of
      touch, clearness of tone, skillful handling of the subject, fine shading.
      It was the triumph of mind over matter; quite.
    </p>
    <p>
      Perhaps the greenest cabbage-leaf ever grown in a garden was wrapped about
      this steak, before it was delivered over to Tom. But the butcher had a
      sentiment for his business, and knew how to refine upon it. When he saw
      Tom putting the cabbage-leaf into his pocket awkwardly, he begged to be
      allowed to do it for him; &lsquo;for meat,&rsquo; he said with some emotion, &lsquo;must be
      humoured, not drove.&rsquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      Back they went to the lodgings again, after they had bought some eggs, and
      flour, and such small matters; and Tom sat gravely down to write at one
      end of the parlour table, while Ruth prepared to make the pudding at the
      other end; for there was nobody in the house but an old woman (the
      landlord being a mysterious sort of man, who went out early in the
      morning, and was scarcely ever seen); and saving in mere household
      drudgery, they waited on themselves.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;What are you writing, Tom?&rsquo; inquired his sister, laying her hand upon his
      shoulder.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Why, you see, my dear,&rsquo; said Tom, leaning back in his chair, and looking
      up in her face, &lsquo;I am very anxious, of course, to obtain some suitable
      employment; and before Mr Westlock comes this afternoon, I think I may as
      well prepare a little description of myself and my qualifications; such as
      he could show to any friend of his.&rsquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;You had better do the same for me, Tom, also,&rsquo; said his sister, casting
      down her eyes. &lsquo;I should dearly like to keep house for you and take care
      of you always, Tom; but we are not rich enough for that.&rsquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;We are not rich,&rsquo; returned Tom, &lsquo;certainly; and we may be much poorer.
      But we will not part if we can help it. No, no; we will make up our minds
      Ruth, that unless we are so very unfortunate as to render me quite sure
      that you would be better off away from me than with me, we will battle it
      out together. I am certain we shall be happier if we can battle it out
      together. Don&rsquo;t you think we shall?&rsquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Think, Tom!&rsquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Oh, tut, tut!&rsquo; interposed Tom, tenderly. &lsquo;You mustn&rsquo;t cry.&rsquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;No, no; I won&rsquo;t, Tom. But you can&rsquo;t afford it, dear. You can&rsquo;t, indeed.&rsquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;We don&rsquo;t know that,&rsquo; said Tom. &lsquo;How are we to know that, yet awhile, and
      without trying? Lord bless my soul!&rsquo;&mdash;Tom&rsquo;s energy became quite grand&mdash;&lsquo;there
      is no knowing what may happen, if we try hard. And I am sure we can live
      contentedly upon a very little&mdash;if we can only get it.&rsquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Yes; that I am sure we can, Tom.&rsquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Why, then,&rsquo; said Tom, &lsquo;we must try for it. My friend, John Westlock, is a
      capital fellow, and very shrewd and intelligent. I&rsquo;ll take his advice.
      We&rsquo;ll talk it over with him&mdash;both of us together. You&rsquo;ll like John
      very much, when you come to know him, I am certain. Don&rsquo;t cry, don&rsquo;t cry.
      <i>You </i>make a beef-steak pudding, indeed!&rsquo; said Tom, giving her a gentle
      push. &lsquo;Why, you haven&rsquo;t boldness enough for a dumpling!&rsquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;You <i>will </i>call it a pudding, Tom. Mind! I told you not!&rsquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;I may as well call it that, till it proves to be something else,&rsquo; said
      Tom. &lsquo;Oh, you are going to work in earnest, are you?&rsquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      Aye, aye! That she was. And in such pleasant earnest, moreover, that Tom&rsquo;s
      attention wandered from his writing every moment. First, she tripped
      downstairs into the kitchen for the flour, then for the pie-board, then
      for the eggs, then for the butter, then for a jug of water, then for the
      rolling-pin, then for a pudding-basin, then for the pepper, then for the
      salt; making a separate journey for everything, and laughing every time
      she started off afresh. When all the materials were collected she was
      horrified to find she had no apron on, and so ran <i>up</i>stairs by way of
      variety, to fetch it. She didn&rsquo;t put it on upstairs, but came dancing down
      with it in her hand; and being one of those little women to whom an apron
      is a most becoming little vanity, it took an immense time to arrange;
      having to be carefully smoothed down beneath&mdash;Oh, heaven, what a
      wicked little stomacher!&mdash;and to be gathered up into little plaits by
      the strings before it could be tied, and to be tapped, rebuked, and
      wheedled, at the pockets, before it would set right, which at last it did,
      and when it did&mdash;but never mind; this is a sober chronicle. And then,
      there were her cuffs to be tucked up, for fear of flour; and she had a
      little ring to pull off her finger, which wouldn&rsquo;t come off (foolish
      little ring!); and during the whole of these preparations she looked
      demurely every now and then at Tom, from under her dark eyelashes, as if
      they were all a part of the pudding, and indispensable to its composition.
    </p>
    <p>
      For the life and soul of him, Tom could get no further in his writing
      than, &lsquo;A respectable young man, aged thirty-five,&rsquo; and this,
      notwithstanding the show she made of being supernaturally quiet, and going
      about on tiptoe, lest she should disturb him; which only served as an
      additional means of distracting his attention, and keeping it upon her.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Tom,&rsquo; she said at last, in high glee. &lsquo;Tom!&rsquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;What now?&rsquo; said Tom, repeating to himself, &lsquo;aged thirty-five!&rsquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Will you look here a moment, please?&rsquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      As if he hadn&rsquo;t been looking all the time!
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;I am going to begin, Tom. Don&rsquo;t you wonder why I butter the inside of the
      basin?&rsquo; said his busy little sister.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Not more than you do, I dare say,&rsquo; replied Tom, laughing. &lsquo;For I believe
      you don&rsquo;t know anything about it.&rsquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;What an infidel you are, Tom! How else do you think it would turn out
      easily when it was done! For a civil-engineer and land-surveyor not to
      know that! My goodness, Tom!&rsquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      It was wholly out of the question to try to write. Tom lined out
      &lsquo;respectable young man, aged thirty-five;&rsquo; and sat looking on, pen in
      hand, with one of the most loving smiles imaginable.
    </p>
    <p>
      Such a busy little woman as she was! So full of self-importance and trying
      so hard not to smile, or seem uncertain about anything! It was a perfect
      treat to Tom to see her with her brows knit, and her rosy lips pursed up,
      kneading away at the crust, rolling it out, cutting it up into strips,
      lining the basin with it, shaving it off fine round the rim, chopping up
      the steak into small pieces, raining down pepper and salt upon them,
      packing them into the basin, pouring in cold water for gravy, and never
      venturing to steal a look in his direction, lest her gravity should be
      disturbed; until, at last, the basin being quite full and only wanting the
      top crust, she clapped her hands all covered with paste and flour, at Tom,
      and burst out heartily into such a charming little laugh of triumph, that
      the pudding need have had no other seasoning to commend it to the taste of
      any reasonable man on earth.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Where&rsquo;s the pudding?&rsquo; said Tom. For he was cutting his jokes, Tom was.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Where!&rsquo; she answered, holding it up with both hands. &lsquo;Look at it!&rsquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;<i>That </i>a pudding!&rsquo; said Tom.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;It <i>will </i>be, you stupid fellow, when it&rsquo;s covered in,&rsquo; returned his
      sister. Tom still pretending to look incredulous, she gave him a tap on
      the head with the rolling-pin, and still laughing merrily, had returned to
      the composition of the top crust, when she started and turned very red.
      Tom started, too, for following her eyes, he saw John Westlock in the
      room.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Why, my goodness, John! How did <i>you </i>come in?&rsquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;I beg pardon,&rsquo; said John&mdash;&rsquo; your sister&rsquo;s pardon especially&mdash;but
      I met an old lady at the street door, who requested me to enter here; and
      as you didn&rsquo;t hear me knock, and the door was open, I made bold to do so.
      I hardly know,&rsquo; said John, with a smile, &lsquo;why any of us should be
      disconcerted at my having accidentally intruded upon such an agreeable
      domestic occupation, so very agreeably and skillfully pursued; but I must
      confess that I am. Tom, will you kindly come to my relief?&rsquo;

      &lsquo;I hope that, as the sister of so old a friend,&rsquo; said John, laughing &lsquo;you

      John said, of course, that this was quite unnecessary, for he had been
      transfixed in silent admiration; and he held out his hand to Miss Pinch;
      who couldn&rsquo;t take it, however, by reason of the flour and paste upon her
      own. This, which might seem calculated to increase the general confusion
      and render matters worse, had in reality the best effect in the world, for
      neither of them could help laughing; and so they both found themselves on
      easy terms immediately.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;I am delighted to see you,&rsquo; said Tom. &lsquo;Sit down.&rsquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;I can only think of sitting down on one condition,&rsquo; returned his friend;
      &lsquo;and that is, that your sister goes on with the pudding, as if you were
      still alone.&rsquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;That I am sure she will,&rsquo; said Tom. &lsquo;On one other condition, and that is,
      that you stay and help us to eat it.&rsquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      Poor little Ruth was seized with a palpitation of the heart when Tom
      committed this appalling indiscretion, for she felt that if the dish
      turned out a failure, she never would be able to hold up her head before
      John Westlock again. Quite unconscious of her state of mind, John accepted
      the invitation with all imaginable heartiness; and after a little more
      pleasantry concerning this same pudding, and the tremendous expectations
      he made believe to entertain of it, she blushingly resumed her occupation,
      and he took a chair.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;I am here much earlier than I intended, Tom; but I will tell you, what
      brings me, and I think I can answer for your being glad to hear it. Is
      that anything you wish to show me?&rsquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Oh dear no!&rsquo; cried Tom, who had forgotten the blotted scrap of paper in
      his hand, until this inquiry brought it to his recollection. &lsquo;&ldquo;A
      respectable young man, aged thirty-five&rdquo;&mdash;The beginning of a
      description of myself. That&rsquo;s all.&rsquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;I don&rsquo;t think you will have occasion to finish it, Tom. But how is it you
      never told me you had friends in London?&rsquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      Tom looked at his sister with all his might; and certainly his sister
      looked with all her might at him.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Friends in London!&rsquo; echoed Tom.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Ah!&rsquo; said Westlock, &lsquo;to be sure.&rsquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Have <i>you </i>any friends in London, Ruth, my dear!&rsquo; asked Tom.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;No, Tom.&rsquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;I am very happy to hear that I have,&rsquo; said Tom, &lsquo;but it&rsquo;s news to me. I
      never knew it. They must be capital people to keep a secret, John.&rsquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;You shall judge for yourself,&rsquo; returned the other. &lsquo;Seriously, Tom, here
      is the plain state of the case. As I was sitting at breakfast this
      morning, there comes a knock at my door.&rsquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;On which you cried out, very loud, &ldquo;Come in!&rdquo;&rsquo; suggested Tom.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;So I did. And the person who knocked, not being a respectable young man,
      aged thirty-five, from the country, came in when he was invited, instead
      of standing gaping and staring about him on the landing. Well! When he
      came in, I found he was a stranger; a grave, business-like,
      sedate-looking, stranger. &ldquo;Mr Westlock?&rdquo; said he. &ldquo;That is my name,&rdquo; said
      I. &ldquo;The favour of a few words with you?&rdquo; said he. &ldquo;Pray be seated, sir,&rdquo;
       said I.&rsquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      Here John stopped for an instant, to glance towards the table, where Tom&rsquo;s
      sister, listening attentively, was still busy with the basin, which by
      this time made a noble appearance. Then he resumed:
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;The pudding having taken a chair, Tom&mdash;&rsquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;What!&rsquo; cried Tom.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Having taken a chair.&rsquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;You said a pudding.&rsquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;No, no,&rsquo; replied John, colouring rather; &lsquo;a chair. The idea of a stranger
      coming into my rooms at half-past eight o&rsquo;clock in the morning, and taking
      a pudding! Having taken a chair, Tom, a chair&mdash;amazed me by opening
      the conversation thus: &ldquo;I believe you are acquainted, sir, with Mr Thomas
      Pinch?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;No!&rsquo; cried Tom.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;His very words, I assure you. I told him I was. Did I know where you were
      at present residing? Yes. In London? Yes. He had casually heard, in a
      roundabout way, that you had left your situation with Mr Pecksniff. Was
      that the fact? Yes, it was. Did you want another? Yes, you did.&rsquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Certainly,&rsquo; said Tom, nodding his head.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Just what I impressed upon him. You may rest assured that I set that
      point beyond the possibility of any mistake, and gave him distinctly to
      understand that he might make up his mind about it. Very well.&rsquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Then,&rdquo; said he, &ldquo;I think I can accommodate him.&rdquo;&rsquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      Tom&rsquo;s sister stopped short.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Lord bless me!&rsquo; cried Tom. &lsquo;Ruth, my dear, &ldquo;think I can accommodate
      him.&rdquo;&rsquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Of course I begged him,&rsquo; pursued John Westlock, glancing at Tom&rsquo;s sister,
      who was not less eager in her interest than Tom himself, &lsquo;to proceed, and
      said that I would undertake to see you immediately. He replied that he had
      very little to say, being a man of few words, but such as it was, it was
      to the purpose&mdash;and so, indeed, it turned out&mdash;for he
      immediately went on to tell me that a friend of his was in want of a kind
      of secretary and librarian; and that although the salary was small, being
      only a hundred pounds a year, with neither board nor lodging, still the
      duties were not heavy, and there the post was. Vacant, and ready for your
      acceptance.&rsquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Good gracious me!&rsquo; cried Tom; &lsquo;a hundred pounds a year! My dear John!
      Ruth, my love! A hundred pounds a year!&rsquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;But the strangest part of the story,&rsquo; resumed John Westlock, laying his
      hand on Tom&rsquo;s wrist, to bespeak his attention, and repress his ecstasies
      for the moment; &lsquo;the strangest part of the story, Miss Pinch, is this. I
      don&rsquo;t know this man from Adam; neither does this man know Tom.&rsquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;He can&rsquo;t,&rsquo; said Tom, in great perplexity, &lsquo;if he&rsquo;s a Londoner. I don&rsquo;t
      know any one in London.&rsquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;And on my observing,&rsquo; John resumed, still keeping his hand upon Tom&rsquo;s
      wrist, &lsquo;that I had no doubt he would excuse the freedom I took in
      inquiring who directed him to me; how he came to know of the change which
      had taken place in my friend&rsquo;s position; and how he came to be acquainted
      with my friend&rsquo;s peculiar fitness for such an office as he had described;
      he drily said that he was not at liberty to enter into any explanations.&rsquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Not at liberty to enter into any explanations!&rsquo; repeated Tom, drawing a
      long breath.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;&ldquo;I must be perfectly aware,&rdquo; he said,&rsquo; John added, &lsquo;&ldquo;that to any person
      who had ever been in Mr Pecksniff&rsquo;s neighbourhood, Mr Thomas Pinch and his
      acquirements were as well known as the Church steeple, or the Blue
      Dragon.&rdquo;&rsquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;The Blue Dragon!&rsquo; repeated Tom, staring alternately at his friend and his
      sister.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Aye, think of that! He spoke as familiarly of the Blue Dragon, I give you
      my word, as if he had been Mark Tapley. I opened my eyes, I can tell you,
      when he did so; but I could not fancy I had ever seen the man before,
      although he said with a smile, &ldquo;You know the Blue Dragon, Mr Westlock; you
      kept it up there, once or twice, yourself.&rdquo; Kept it up there! So I did.
      You remember, Tom?&rsquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      Tom nodded with great significance, and, falling into a state of deeper
      perplexity than before, observed that this was the most unaccountable and
      extraordinary circumstance he had ever heard of in his life.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Unaccountable?&rsquo; his friend repeated. &lsquo;I became afraid of the man. Though
      it was broad day, and bright sunshine, I was positively afraid of him. I
      declare I half suspected him to be a supernatural visitor, and not a
      mortal, until he took out a common-place description of pocket-book, and
      handed me this card.&rsquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Mr Fips,&rsquo; said Tom, reading it aloud. &lsquo;Austin Friars. Austin Friars
      sounds ghostly, John.&rsquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Fips don&rsquo;t, I think,&rsquo; was John&rsquo;s reply. &lsquo;But there he lives, Tom, and
      there he expects us to call this morning. And now you know as much of this
      strange incident as I do, upon my honour.&rsquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      Tom&rsquo;s face, between his exultation in the hundred pounds a year, and his
      wonder at this narration, was only to be equalled by the face of his
      sister, on which there sat the very best expression of blooming surprise
      that any painter could have wished to see. What the beef-steak pudding
      would have come to, if it had not been by this time finished, astrology
      itself could hardly determine.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Tom,&rsquo; said Ruth, after a little hesitation, &lsquo;perhaps Mr Westlock, in his
      friendship for you, knows more of this than he chooses to tell.&rsquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;No, indeed!&rsquo; cried John, eagerly. &lsquo;It is not so, I assure you. I wish it
      were. I cannot take credit to myself, Miss Pinch, for any such thing. All
      that I know, or, so far as I can judge, am likely to know, I have told
      you.&rsquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Couldn&rsquo;t you know more, if you thought proper?&rsquo; said Ruth, scraping the
      pie-board industriously.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;No,&rsquo; retorted John. &lsquo;Indeed, no. It is very ungenerous in you to be so
      suspicious of me when I repose implicit faith in you. I have unbounded
      confidence in the pudding, Miss Pinch.&rsquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      She laughed at this, but they soon got back into a serious vein, and
      discussed the subject with profound gravity. Whatever else was obscure in
      the business, it appeared to be quite plain that Tom was offered a salary
      of one hundred pounds a year; and this being the main point, the
      surrounding obscurity rather set it off than otherwise.
    </p>
    <p>
      Tom, being in a great flutter, wished to start for Austin Friars
      instantly, but they waited nearly an hour, by John&rsquo;s advice, before they
      departed. Tom made himself as spruce as he could before leaving home, and
      when John Westlock, through the half-opened parlour door, had glimpses of
      that brave little sister brushing the collar of his coat in the passage,
      taking up loose stitches in his gloves and hovering lightly about and
      about him, touching him up here and there in the height of her quaint,
      little, old-fashioned tidiness, he called to mind the fancy-portraits of
      her on the wall of the Pecksniffian workroom, and decided with uncommon
      indignation that they were gross libels, and not half pretty enough;
      though, as hath been mentioned in its place, the artists always made those
      sketches beautiful, and he had drawn at least a score of them with his own
      hands.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Tom,&rsquo; he said, as they were walking along, &lsquo;I begin to think you must be
      somebody&rsquo;s son.&rsquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;I suppose I am,&rsquo; Tom answered in his quiet way.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;But I mean somebody&rsquo;s of consequence.&rsquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Bless your heart,&rsquo; replied Tom, &lsquo;my poor father was of no consequence,
      nor my mother either.&rsquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;You remember them perfectly, then?&rsquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Remember them? oh dear yes. My poor mother was the last. She died when
      Ruth was a mere baby, and then we both became a charge upon the savings of
      that good old grandmother I used to tell you of. You remember! Oh! There&rsquo;s
      nothing romantic in our history, John.&rsquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Very well,&rsquo; said John in quiet despair. &lsquo;Then there is no way of
      accounting for my visitor of this morning. So we&rsquo;ll not try, Tom.&rsquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      They did try, notwithstanding, and never left off trying until they got to
      Austin Friars, where, in a very dark passage on the first floor, oddly
      situated at the back of a house, across some leads, they found a little
      blear-eyed glass door up in one corner, with Mr <i>Fips </i>painted on it in
      characters which were meant to be transparent. There was also a wicked old
      sideboard hiding in the gloom hard by, meditating designs upon the ribs of
      visitors; and an old mat, worn into lattice work, which, being useless as
      a mat (even if anybody could have seen it, which was impossible), had for
      many years directed its industry into another channel, and regularly
      tripped up every one of Mr Fips&rsquo;s clients.
    </p>
    <p>
      Mr Fips, hearing a violent concussion between a human hat and his office
      door, was apprised, by the usual means of communication, that somebody had
      come to call upon him, and giving that somebody admission, observed that
      it was &lsquo;rather dark.&rsquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Dark indeed,&rsquo; John whispered in Tom Pinch&rsquo;s ear. &lsquo;Not a bad place to
      dispose of a countryman in, I should think, Tom.&rsquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      Tom had been already turning over in his mind the possibility of their
      having been tempted into that region to furnish forth a pie; but the sight
      of Mr Fips, who was small and spare, and looked peaceable, and wore black
      shorts and powder, dispelled his doubts.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Walk in,&rsquo; said Mr Fips.
    </p>
    <p>
      They walked in. And a mighty yellow-jaundiced little office Mr Fips had of
      it; with a great, black, sprawling splash upon the floor in one corner, as
      if some old clerk had cut his throat there, years ago, and had let out ink
      instead of blood.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;I have brought my friend Mr Pinch, sir,&rsquo; said John Westlock.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Be pleased to sit,&rsquo; said Mr Fips.
    </p>
    <p>
      They occupied the two chairs, and Mr Fips took the office stool from the
      stuffing whereof he drew forth a piece of horse-hair of immense length,
      which he put into his mouth with a great appearance of appetite.
    </p>
    <p>
      He looked at Tom Pinch curiously, but with an entire freedom from any such
      expression as could be reasonably construed into an unusual display of
      interest. After a short silence, during which Mr Fips was so perfectly
      unembarrassed as to render it manifest that he could have broken it sooner
      without hesitation, if he had felt inclined to do so, he asked if Mr
      Westlock had made his offer fully known to Mr Pinch.
    </p>
    <p>
      John answered in the affirmative.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;And you think it worth your while, sir, do you?&rsquo; Mr Fips inquired of Tom.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;I think it a piece of great good fortune, sir,&rsquo; said Tom. &lsquo;I am
      exceedingly obliged to you for the offer.&rsquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Not to me,&rsquo; said Mr Fips. &lsquo;I act upon instructions.&rsquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;To your friend, sir, then,&rsquo; said Tom. &lsquo;To the gentleman with whom I am to
      engage, and whose confidence I shall endeavour to deserve. When he knows
      me better, sir, I hope he will not lose his good opinion of me. He will
      find me punctual and vigilant, and anxious to do what is right. That I
      think I can answer for, and so,&rsquo; looking towards him, &lsquo;can Mr Westlock.&rsquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Most assuredly,&rsquo; said John.
    </p>
    <p>
      Mr Fips appeared to have some little difficulty in resuming the
      conversation. To relieve himself, he took up the wafer-stamp, and began
      stamping capital F&rsquo;s all over his legs.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;The fact is,&rsquo; said Mr Fips, &lsquo;that my friend is not, at this present
      moment, in town.&rsquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      Tom&rsquo;s countenance fell; for he thought this equivalent to telling him that
      his appearance did not answer; and that Fips must look out for somebody
      else.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;When do you think he will be in town, sir?&rsquo; he asked.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;I can&rsquo;t say; it&rsquo;s impossible to tell. I really have no idea. But,&rsquo; said
      Fips, taking off a very deep impression of the wafer-stamp upon the calf
      of his left leg, and looking steadily at Tom, &lsquo;I don&rsquo;t know that it&rsquo;s a
      matter of much consequence.&rsquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      Poor Tom inclined his head deferentially, but appeared to doubt that.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;I say,&rsquo; repeated Mr Fips, &lsquo;that I don&rsquo;t know it&rsquo;s a matter of much
      consequence. The business lies entirely between yourself and me, Mr Pinch.
      With reference to your duties, I can set you going; and with reference to
      your salary, I can pay it. Weekly,&rsquo; said Mr Fips, putting down the
      wafer-stamp, and looking at John Westlock and Tom Pinch by turns, &lsquo;weekly;
      in this office; at any time between the hours of four and five o&rsquo;clock in
      the afternoon.&rsquo; As Mr Fips said this, he made up his face as if he were
      going to whistle. But he didn&rsquo;t.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;You are very good,&rsquo; said Tom, whose countenance was now suffused with
      pleasure; &lsquo;and nothing can be more satisfactory or straightforward. My
      attendance will be required&mdash;&rsquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;From half-past nine to four o&rsquo;clock or so, I should say,&rsquo; interrupted Mr
      Fips. &lsquo;About that.&rsquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;I did not mean the hours of attendance,&rsquo; retorted Tom, &lsquo;which are light
      and easy, I am sure; but the place.&rsquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Oh, the place! The place is in the Temple.&rsquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      Tom was delighted.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Perhaps,&rsquo; said Mr Fips, &lsquo;you would like to see the place?&rsquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Oh, dear!&rsquo; cried Tom. &lsquo;I shall only be too glad to consider myself
      engaged, if you will allow me; without any further reference to the
      place.&rsquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;You may consider yourself engaged, by all means,&rsquo; said Mr Fips; &lsquo;you
      couldn&rsquo;t meet me at the Temple Gate in Fleet Street, in an hour from this
      time, I suppose, could you?&rsquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      Certainly Tom could.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Good,&rsquo; said Mr Fips, rising. &lsquo;Then I will show you the place; and you can
      begin your attendance to-morrow morning. In an hour, therefore, I shall
      see you. You too, Mr Westlock? Very good. Take care how you go. It&rsquo;s
      rather dark.&rsquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      With this remark, which seemed superfluous, he shut them out upon the
      staircase, and they groped their way into the street again. The interview
      had done so little to remove the mystery in which Tom&rsquo;s new engagement was
      involved, and had done so much to thicken it, that neither could help
      smiling at the puzzled looks of the other. They agreed, however, that the
      introduction of Tom to his new office and office companions could hardly
      fail to throw a light upon the subject; and therefore postponed its
      further consideration until after the fulfillment of the appointment they
      had made with Mr Fips.
    </p>
    <p>
      After looking at John Westlock&rsquo;s chambers, and devoting a few spare
      minutes to the Boar&rsquo;s Head, they issued forth again to the place of
      meeting. The time agreed upon had not quite come; but Mr Fips was already
      at the Temple Gate, and expressed his satisfaction at their punctuality.
    </p>
    <p>
      He led the way through sundry lanes and courts, into one more quiet and
      more gloomy than the rest, and, singling out a certain house, ascended a
      common staircase; taking from his pocket, as he went, a bunch of rusty
      keys. Stopping before a door upon an upper story, which had nothing but a
      yellow smear of paint where custom would have placed the tenant&rsquo;s name, he
      began to beat the dust out of one of these keys, very deliberately, upon
      the great broad handrail of the balustrade.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;You had better have a little plug made,&rsquo; he said, looking round at Tom,
      after blowing a shrill whistle into the barrel of the key. &lsquo;It&rsquo;s the only
      way of preventing them from getting stopped up. You&rsquo;ll find the lock go
      the better, too, I dare say, for a little oil.&rsquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      Tom thanked him; but was too much occupied with his own speculations, and
      John Westlock&rsquo;s looks, to be very talkative. In the meantime Mr Fips
      opened the door, which yielded to his hand very unwillingly, and with a
      horribly discordant sound. He took the key out, when he had done so, and
      gave it to Tom.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Aye, aye!&rsquo; said Mr Fips. &lsquo;The dust lies rather thick here.&rsquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      Truly, it did. Mr Fips might have gone so far as to say, very thick. It
      had accumulated everywhere; lay deep on everything, and in one part, where
      a ray of sun shone through a crevice in the shutter and struck upon the
      opposite wall, it went twirling round and round, like a gigantic
      squirrel-cage.
    </p>
    <p>
      Dust was the only thing in the place that had any motion about it. When
      their conductor admitted the light freely, and lifting up the heavy
      window-sash, let in the summer air, he showed the mouldering furniture,
      discoloured wainscoting and ceiling, rusty stove, and ashy hearth, in all
      their inert neglect. Close to the door there stood a candlestick, with an
      extinguisher upon it; as if the last man who had been there had paused,
      after securing a retreat, to take a parting look at the dreariness he left
      behind, and then had shut out light and life together, and closed the
      place up like a tomb.
    </p>
    <p>
      There were two rooms on that floor; and in the first or outer one a narrow
      staircase, leading to two more above. These last were fitted up as
      bed-chambers. Neither in them, nor in the rooms below, was any scarcity of
      convenient furniture observable, although the fittings were of a bygone
      fashion; but solitude and want of use seemed to have rendered it unfit for
      any purposes of comfort, and to have given it a grisly, haunted air.
    </p>
    <p>
      Movables of every kind lay strewn about, without the least attempt at
      order, and were intermixed with boxes, hampers, and all sorts of lumber.
      On all the floors were piles of books, to the amount, perhaps, of some
      thousands of volumes: these, still in bales; those, wrapped in paper, as
      they had been purchased; others scattered singly or in heaps; not one upon
      the shelves which lined the walls. To these Mr Fips called Tom&rsquo;s
      attention.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Before anything else can be done, we must have them put in order,
      catalogued, and ranged upon the book-shelves, Mr Pinch. That will do to
      begin with, I think, sir.&rsquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      Tom rubbed his hands in the pleasant anticipation of a task so congenial
      to his taste, and said:
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;An occupation full of interest for me, I assure you. It will occupy me,
      perhaps, until Mr&mdash;&rsquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Until Mr&mdash;&rsquo; repeated Fips; as much as to ask Tom what he was
      stopping for.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;I forgot that you had not mentioned the gentleman&rsquo;s name,&rsquo; said Tom.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Oh!&rsquo; cried Mr Fips, pulling on his glove, &lsquo;didn&rsquo;t I? No, by-the-bye, I
      don&rsquo;t think I did. Ah! I dare say he&rsquo;ll be here soon. You will get on very
      well together, I have no doubt. I wish you success I am sure. You won&rsquo;t
      forget to shut the door? It&rsquo;ll lock of itself if you slam it. Half-past
      nine, you know. Let us say from half-past nine to four, or half-past four,
      or thereabouts; one day, perhaps, a little earlier, another day, perhaps,
      a little later, according as you feel disposed, and as you arrange your
      work. Mr Fips, Austin Friars of course you&rsquo;ll remember? And you won&rsquo;t
      forget to slam the door, if you please!&rsquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      He said all this in such a comfortable, easy manner, that Tom could only
      rub his hands, and nod his head, and smile in acquiescence which he was
      still doing, when Mr Fips walked coolly out.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Why, he&rsquo;s gone!&rsquo; cried Tom.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;And what&rsquo;s more, Tom,&rsquo; said John Westlock, seating himself upon a pile of
      books, and looking up at his astonished friend, &lsquo;he is evidently not
      coming back again; so here you are, installed. Under rather singular
      circumstances, Tom!&rsquo;
    </p>
<div class="fig" style="width:65%">
      <img src="images/20629m.jpg" alt="20629m " width="100%" /><br />
    </div>
    <h5>
      <a href="images/20629.jpg"><i>Original</i></a>
    </h5>
    <p>
      It was such an odd affair throughout, and Tom standing there among the
      books with his hat in one hand and the key in the other, looked so
      prodigiously confounded, that his friend could not help laughing heartily.
      Tom himself was tickled; no less by the hilarity of his friend than by the
      recollection of the sudden manner in which he had been brought to a stop,
      in the very height of his urbane conference with Mr Fips; so by degrees
      Tom burst out laughing too; and each making the other laugh more, they
      fairly roared.
    </p>
    <p>
      When they had had their laugh out, which did not happen very soon, for
      give John an inch that way and he was sure to take several ells, being a
      jovial, good-tempered fellow, they looked about them more closely, groping
      among the lumber for any stray means of enlightenment that might turn up.
      But no scrap or shred of information could they find. The books were
      marked with a variety of owner&rsquo;s names, having, no doubt, been bought at
      sales, and collected here and there at different times; but whether any
      one of these names belonged to Tom&rsquo;s employer, and, if so, which of them,
      they had no means whatever of determining. It occurred to John as a very
      bright thought to make inquiry at the steward&rsquo;s office, to whom the
      chambers belonged, or by whom they were held; but he came back no wiser
      than he went, the answer being, &lsquo;Mr Fips, of Austin Friars.&rsquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;After all, Tom, I begin to think it lies no deeper than this. Fips is an
      eccentric man; has some knowledge of Pecksniff; despises him, of course;
      has heard or seen enough of you to know that you are the man he wants; and
      engages you in his own whimsical manner.&rsquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;But why in his own whimsical manner?&rsquo; asked Tom.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Oh! why does any man entertain his own whimsical taste? Why does Mr Fips
      wear shorts and powder, and Mr Fips&rsquo;s next-door neighbour boots and a
      wig?&rsquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      Tom, being in that state of mind in which any explanation is a great
      relief, adopted this last one (which indeed was quite as feasible as any
      other) readily, and said he had no doubt of it. Nor was his faith at all
      shaken by his having said exactly the same thing to each suggestion of his
      friend&rsquo;s in turn, and being perfectly ready to say it again if he had any
      new solution to propose.
    </p>
    <p>
      As he had not, Tom drew down the window-sash, and folded the shutter; and
      they left the rooms. He closed the door heavily, as Mr Fips had desired
      him; tried it, found it all safe, and put the key in his pocket.
    </p>
    <p>
      They made a pretty wide circuit in going back to Islington, as they had
      time to spare, and Tom was never tired of looking about him. It was well
      he had John Westlock for his companion, for most people would have been
      weary of his perpetual stoppages at shop-windows, and his frequent dashes
      into the crowded carriage-way at the peril of his life, to get the better
      view of church steeples, and other public buildings. But John was charmed
      to see him so much interested, and every time Tom came back with a beaming
      face from among the wheels of carts and hackney-coaches, wholly
      unconscious of the personal congratulations addressed to him by the
      drivers, John seemed to like him better than before.
    </p>
    <p>
      There was no flour on Ruth&rsquo;s hands when she received them in the
      triangular parlour, but there were pleasant smiles upon her face, and a
      crowd of welcomes shining out of every smile, and gleaming in her bright
      eyes. By the bye, how bright they were! Looking into them for but a
      moment, when you took her hand, you saw, in each, such a capital miniature
      of yourself, representing you as such a restless, flashing, eager,
      brilliant little fellow&mdash;
    </p>
    <p>
      Ah! if you could only have kept them for your own miniature! But, wicked,
      roving, restless, too impartial eyes, it was enough for any one to stand
      before them, and, straightway, there he danced and sparkled quite as
      merrily as you!
    </p>
    <p>
      The table was already spread for dinner; and though it was spread with
      nothing very choice in the way of glass or linen, and with green-handled
      knives, and very mountebanks of two-pronged forks, which seemed to be
      trying how far asunder they could possibly stretch their legs without
      converting themselves into double the number of iron toothpicks, it wanted
      neither damask, silver, gold, nor china; no, nor any other garniture at
      all. There it was; and, being there, nothing else would have done as well.
    </p>
    <p>
      The success of that initiative dish; that first experiment of hers in
      cookery; was so entire, so unalloyed and perfect, that John Westlock and
      Tom agreed she must have been studying the art in secret for a long time
      past; and urged her to make a full confession of the fact. They were
      exceedingly merry over this jest, and many smart things were said
      concerning it; but John was not as fair in his behaviour as might have
      been expected, for, after luring Tom Pinch on for a long time, he suddenly
      went over to the enemy, and swore to everything his sister said. However,
      as Tom observed the same night before going to bed, it was only in joke,
      and John had always been famous for being polite to ladies, even when he
      was quite a boy. Ruth said, &lsquo;Oh! indeed!&rsquo; She didn&rsquo;t say anything else.
    </p>
    <p>
      It is astonishing how much three people may find to talk about. They
      scarcely left off talking once. And it was not all lively chat which
      occupied them; for when Tom related how he had seen Mr Pecksniff&rsquo;s
      daughters, and what a change had fallen on the younger, they were very
      serious.
    </p>
    <p>
      John Westlock became quite absorbed in her fortunes; asking many questions
      of Tom Pinch about her marriage, inquiring whether her husband was the
      gentleman whom Tom had brought to dine with him at Salisbury; in what
      degree of relationship they stood towards each other, being different
      persons; and taking, in short, the greatest interest in the subject. Tom
      then went into it, at full length; he told how Martin had gone abroad, and
      had not been heard of for a long time; how Dragon Mark had borne him
      company; how Mr Pecksniff had got the poor old doting grandfather into his
      power; and how he basely sought the hand of Mary Graham. But not a word
      said Tom of what lay hidden in his heart; his heart, so deep, and true,
      and full of honour, and yet with so much room for every gentle and
      unselfish thought; not a word.
    </p>
    <p>
      Tom, Tom! The man in all this world most confident in his sagacity and
      shrewdness; the man in all this world most proud of his distrust of other
      men, and having most to show in gold and silver as the gains belonging to
      his creed; the meekest favourer of that wise doctrine, Every man for
      himself, and God for us all (there being high wisdom in the thought that
      the Eternal Majesty of Heaven ever was, or can be, on the side of selfish
      lust and love!); shall never find, oh, never find, be sure of that, the
      time come home to him, when all his wisdom is an idiot&rsquo;s folly, weighed
      against a simple heart!
    </p>
    <p>
      Well, well, Tom, it was simple too, though simple in a different way, to
      be so eager touching that same theatre, of which John said, when tea was
      done, he had the absolute command, so far as taking parties in without the
      payment of a sixpence was concerned; and simpler yet, perhaps, never to
      suspect that when he went in first, alone, he paid the money! Simple in
      thee, dear Tom, to laugh and cry so heartily at such a sorry show, so
      poorly shown; simple to be so happy and loquacious trudging home with
      Ruth; simple to be so surprised to find that merry present of a
      cookery-book awaiting her in the parlour next morning, with the
      beef-steak-pudding-leaf turned down and blotted out. There! Let the record
      stand! Thy quality of soul was simple, simple, quite contemptible, Tom
      Pinch!

    <h2>
      CHAPTER FORTY
    </h2>
    <p>
      THE PINCHES MAKE A NEW ACQUAINTANCE, AND HAVE FRESH OCCASION FOR SURPRISE
      AND WONDER
    </p>
    <p>
      There was a ghostly air about these uninhabited chambers in the Temple,
      and attending every circumstance of Tom&rsquo;s employment there, which had a
      strange charm in it. Every morning when he shut his door at Islington, he
      turned his face towards an atmosphere of unaccountable fascination, as
      surely as he turned it to the London smoke; and from that moment it
      thickened round and round him all day long, until the time arrived for
      going home again, and leaving it, like a motionless cloud, behind.
    </p>
    <p>
      It seemed to Tom, every morning, that he approached this ghostly mist, and
      became enveloped in it, by the easiest succession of degrees imaginable.
      Passing from the roar and rattle of the streets into the quiet court-yards
      of the Temple, was the first preparation. Every echo of his footsteps
      sounded to him like a sound from the old walls and pavements, wanting
      language to relate the histories of the dim, dismal rooms; to tell him
      what lost documents were decaying in forgotten corners of the shut-up
      cellars, from whose lattices such mouldy sighs came breathing forth as he
      went past; to whisper of dark bins of rare old wine, bricked up in vaults
      among the old foundations of the Halls; or mutter in a lower tone yet
      darker legends of the cross-legged knights, whose marble effigies were in
      the church. With the first planting of his foot upon the staircase of his
      dusty office, all these mysteries increased; until, ascending step by
      step, as Tom ascended, they attained their full growth in the solitary
      labours of the day.
    </p>
    <p>
      Every day brought one recurring, never-failing source of speculation. This
      employer; would he come to-day, and what would he be like? For Tom could
      not stop short at Mr Fips; he quite believed that Mr Fips had spoken
      truly, when he said he acted for another; and what manner of man that
      other was, became a full-blown flower of wonder in the garden of Tom&rsquo;s
      fancy, which never faded or got trodden down.
    </p>
    <p>
      At one time, he conceived that Mr Pecksniff, repenting of his falsehood,
      might, by exertion of his influence with some third person have devised
      these means of giving him employment. He found this idea so insupportable
      after what had taken place between that good man and himself, that he
      confided it to John Westlock on the very same day; informing John that he
      would rather ply for hire as a porter, than fall so low in his own esteem
      as to accept the smallest obligation from the hands of Mr Pecksniff. But
      John assured him that he (Tom Pinch) was far from doing justice to the
      character of Mr Pecksniff yet, if he supposed that gentleman capable of
      performing a generous action; and that he might make his mind quite easy
      on that head until he saw the sun turn green and the moon black, and at
      the same time distinctly perceived with the naked eye, twelve first-rate
      comets careering round those planets. In which unusual state of things, he
      said (and not before), it might become not absolutely lunatic to suspect
      Mr Pecksniff of anything so monstrous. In short he laughed the idea down
      completely; and Tom, abandoning it, was thrown upon his beam-ends again,
      for some other solution.
    </p>
    <p>
      In the meantime Tom attended to his duties daily, and made considerable
      progress with the books; which were already reduced to some sort of order,
      and made a great appearance in his fairly-written catalogue. During his
      business hours, he indulged himself occasionally with snatches of reading;
      which were often, indeed, a necessary part of his pursuit; and as he
      usually made bold to carry one of these goblin volumes home at night
      (always bringing it back again next morning, in case his strange employer
      should appear and ask what had become of it), he led a happy, quiet,
      studious kind of life, after his own heart.
    </p>
    <p>
      But though the books were never so interesting, and never so full of
      novelty to Tom, they could not so enchain him, in those mysterious
      chambers, as to render him unconscious, for a moment, of the lightest
      sound. Any footstep on the flags without set him listening attentively and
      when it turned into that house, and came up, up, up the stairs, he always
      thought with a beating heart, &lsquo;Now I am coming face to face with him at
      last!&rsquo; But no footstep ever passed the floor immediately below: except his
      own.
    </p>
    <p>
      This mystery and loneliness engendered fancies in Tom&rsquo;s mind, the folly of
      which his common sense could readily discover, but which his common sense
      was quite unable to keep away, notwithstanding; that quality being with
      most of us, in such a case, like the old French Police&mdash;quick at
      detection, but very weak as a preventive power. Misgivings, undefined,
      absurd, inexplicable, that there was some one hiding in the inner room&mdash;walking
      softly overhead, peeping in through the door-chink, doing something
      stealthy, anywhere where he was not&mdash;came over him a hundred times a
      day, making it pleasant to throw up the sash, and hold communication even
      with the sparrows who had built in the roof and water-spout, and were
      twittering about the windows all day long.
    </p>
    <p>
      He sat with the outer door wide open, at all times, that he might hear the
      footsteps as they entered, and turned off into the chambers on the lower
      floor. He formed odd prepossessions too, regarding strangers in the
      streets; and would say within himself of such or such a man, who struck
      him as having anything uncommon in his dress or aspect, &lsquo;I shouldn&rsquo;t
      wonder, now, if that were he!&rsquo; But it never was. And though he actually
      turned back and followed more than one of these suspected individuals, in
      a singular belief that they were going to the place he was then upon his
      way from, he never got any other satisfaction by it, than the satisfaction
      of knowing it was not the case.
    </p>
    <p>
      Mr Fips, of Austin Friars, rather deepened than illumined the obscurity of
      his position; for on the first occasion of Tom&rsquo;s waiting on him to receive
      his weekly pay, he said:
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Oh! by the bye, Mr Pinch, you needn&rsquo;t mention it, if you please!&rsquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      Tom thought he was going to tell him a secret; so he said that he wouldn&rsquo;t
      on any account, and that Mr Fips might entirely depend upon him. But as Mr
      Fips said &lsquo;Very good,&rsquo; in reply, and nothing more, Tom prompted him:
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Not on any account,&rsquo; repeated Tom.
    </p>
    <p>
      Mr Fips repeated: &lsquo;Very good.&rsquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;You were going to say&rsquo;&mdash;Tom hinted.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Oh dear no!&rsquo; cried Fips. &lsquo;Not at all.&rsquo; However, seeing Tom confused, he
      added, &lsquo;I mean that you needn&rsquo;t mention any particulars about your place
      of employment, to people generally. You&rsquo;ll find it better not.&rsquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;I have not had the pleasure of seeing my employer yet, sir,&rsquo; observed
      Tom, putting his week&rsquo;s salary in his pocket.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Haven&rsquo;t you?&rsquo; said Fips. &lsquo;No, I don&rsquo;t suppose you have though.&rsquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;I should like to thank him, and to know that what I have done so far, is
      done to his satisfaction,&rsquo; faltered Tom.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Quite right,&rsquo; said Mr Fips, with a yawn. &lsquo;Highly creditable. Very
      proper.&rsquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      Tom hastily resolved to try him on another tack.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;I shall soon have finished with the books,&rsquo; he said. &lsquo;I hope that will
      not terminate my engagement, sir, or render me useless?&rsquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Oh dear no!&rsquo; retorted Fips. &lsquo;Plenty to do; plen-ty to do! Be careful how
      you go. It&rsquo;s rather dark.&rsquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      This was the very utmost extent of information Tom could ever get out of
      <i>him</i>. So it was dark enough in all conscience; and if Mr Fips expressed
      himself with a double meaning, he had good reason for doing so.
    </p>
    <p>
      But now a circumstance occurred, which helped to divert Tom&rsquo;s thoughts
      from even this mystery, and to divide them between it and a new channel,
      which was a very Nile in itself.
    </p>
    <p>
      The way it came about was this. Having always been an early riser and
      having now no organ to engage him in sweet converse every morning, it was
      his habit to take a long walk before going to the Temple; and naturally
      inclining, as a stranger, towards those parts of the town which were
      conspicuous for the life and animation pervading them, he became a great
      frequenter of the market-places, bridges, quays, and especially the
      steam-boat wharves; for it was very lively and fresh to see the people
      hurrying away upon their many schemes of business or pleasure, and it made
      Tom glad to think that there was that much change and freedom in the
      monotonous routine of city lives.
    </p>
    <p>
      In most of these morning excursions Ruth accompanied him. As their
      landlord was always up and away at his business (whatever that might be,
      no one seemed to know) at a very early hour, the habits of the people of
      the house in which they lodged corresponded with their own. Thus they had
      often finished their breakfast, and were out in the summer air, by seven
      o&rsquo;clock. After a two hours&rsquo; stroll they parted at some convenient point;
      Tom going to the Temple, and his sister returning home, as methodically as
      you please.
    </p>
    <p>
      Many and many a pleasant stroll they had in Covent Garden Market; snuffing
      up the perfume of the fruits and flowers, wondering at the magnificence of
      the pineapples and melons; catching glimpses down side avenues, of rows
      and rows of old women, seated on inverted baskets, shelling peas; looking
      unutterable things at the fat bundles of asparagus with which the dainty
      shops were fortified as with a breastwork; and, at the herbalist&rsquo;s doors,
      gratefully inhaling scents as of veal-stuffing yet uncooked, dreamily
      mixed up with capsicums, brown-paper, seeds, even with hints of lusty
      snails and fine young curly leeches. Many and many a pleasant stroll they
      had among the poultry markets, where ducks and fowls, with necks
      unnaturally long, lay stretched out in pairs, ready for cooking; where
      there were speckled eggs in mossy baskets, white country sausages beyond
      impeachment by surviving cat or dog, or horse or donkey; new cheeses to
      any wild extent, live birds in coops and cages, looking much too big to be
      natural, in consequence of those receptacles being much too little;
      rabbits, alive and dead, innumerable. Many a pleasant stroll they had
      among the cool, refreshing, silvery fish-stalls, with a kind of moonlight
      effect about their stock-in-trade, excepting always for the ruddy
      lobsters. Many a pleasant stroll among the waggon-loads of fragrant hay,
      beneath which dogs and tired waggoners lay fast asleep, oblivious of the
      pieman and the public-house. But never half so good a stroll as down among
      the steamboats on a bright morning.
    </p>
    <p>
      There they lay, alongside of each other; hard and fast for ever, to all
      appearance, but designing to get out somehow, and quite confident of doing
      it; and in that faith shoals of passengers, and heaps of luggage, were
      proceeding hurriedly on board. Little steam-boats dashed up and down the
      stream incessantly. Tiers upon tiers of vessels, scores of masts,
      labyrinths of tackle, idle sails, splashing oars, gliding row-boats,
      lumbering barges, sunken piles, with ugly lodgings for the water-rat
      within their mud-discoloured nooks; church steeples, warehouses,
      house-roofs, arches, bridges, men and women, children, casks, cranes,
      boxes, horses, coaches, idlers, and hard-labourers; there they were, all
      jumbled up together, any summer morning, far beyond Tom&rsquo;s power of
      separation.
    </p>
    <p>
      In the midst of all this turmoil there was an incessant roar from every
      packet&rsquo;s funnel, which quite expressed and carried out the uppermost
      emotion of the scene. They all appeared to be perspiring and bothering
      themselves, exactly as their passengers did; they never left off fretting
      and chafing, in their own hoarse manner, once; but were always panting
      out, without any stops, &lsquo;Come along do make haste I&rsquo;m very nervous come
      along oh good gracious we shall never get there how late you are do make
      haste I&rsquo;m off directly come along!&rsquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      Even when they had left off, and had got safely out into the current, on
      the smallest provocation they began again; for the bravest packet of them
      all, being stopped by some entanglement in the river, would immediately
      begin to fume and pant afresh, &lsquo;oh here&rsquo;s a stoppage what&rsquo;s the matter do
      go on there I&rsquo;m in a hurry it&rsquo;s done on purpose did you ever oh my
      goodness <i>do</i> go on here!&rsquo; and so, in a state of mind bordering on
      distraction, would be last seen drifting slowly through the mist into the
      summer light beyond, that made it red.
    </p>
    <p>
      Tom&rsquo;s ship, however; or, at least, the packet-boat in which Tom and his
      sister took the greatest interest on one particular occasion; was not off
      yet, by any means; but was at the height of its disorder. The press of
      passengers was very great; another steam-boat lay on each side of her; the
      gangways were choked up; distracted women, obviously bound for Gravesend,
      but turning a deaf ear to all representations that this particular vessel
      was about to sail for Antwerp, persisted in secreting baskets of
      refreshments behind bulk-heads, and water-casks, and under seats; and very
      great confusion prevailed.
    </p>
    <p>
      It was so amusing, that Tom, with Ruth upon his arm, stood looking down
      from the wharf, as nearly regardless as it was in the nature of flesh and
      blood to be, of an elderly lady behind him, who had brought a large
      umbrella with her, and didn&rsquo;t know what to do with it. This tremendous
      instrument had a hooked handle; and its vicinity was first made known to
      him by a painful pressure on the windpipe, consequent upon its having
      caught him round the throat. Soon after disengaging himself with perfect
      good humour, he had a sensation of the ferule in his back; immediately
      afterwards, of the hook entangling his ankles; then of the umbrella
      generally, wandering about his hat, and flapping at it like a great bird;
      and, lastly, of a poke or thrust below the ribs, which give him such
      exceeding anguish, that he could not refrain from turning round to offer a
      mild remonstrance.
    </p>
    <p>
      Upon his turning round, he found the owner of the umbrella struggling on
      tip-toe, with a countenance expressive of violent animosity, to look down
      upon the steam-boats; from which he inferred that she had attacked him,
      standing in the front row, by design, and as her natural enemy.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;What a very ill-natured person you must be!&rsquo; said Tom.
    </p>
    <p>
      The lady cried out fiercely, &lsquo;Where&rsquo;s the pelisse!&rsquo;&mdash;meaning the
      constabulary&mdash;and went on to say, shaking the handle of the umbrella
      at Tom, that but for them fellers never being in the way when they was
      wanted, she&rsquo;d have given him in charge, she would.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;If they greased their whiskers less, and minded the duties which they&rsquo;re
      paid so heavy for, a little more,&rsquo; she observed, &lsquo;no one needn&rsquo;t be drove
      mad by scrouding so!&rsquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      She had been grievously knocked about, no doubt, for her bonnet was bent
      into the shape of a cocked hat. Being a fat little woman, too, she was in
      a state of great exhaustion and intense heat. Instead of pursuing the
      altercation, therefore, Tom civilly inquired what boat she wanted to go on
      board of?
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;I suppose,&rsquo; returned the lady, &lsquo;as nobody but yourself can want to look
      at a steam package, without wanting to go a-boarding of it, can they!
      Booby!&rsquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Which one do you want to look at then?&rsquo; said Tom. &lsquo;We&rsquo;ll make room for
      you if we can. Don&rsquo;t be so ill-tempered.&rsquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;No blessed creetur as ever I was with in trying times,&rsquo; returned the
      lady, somewhat softened, &lsquo;and they&rsquo;re a many in their numbers, ever
      brought it as a charge again myself that I was anythin&rsquo; but mild and equal
      in my spirits. Never mind a contradicting of me, if you seem to feel it
      does you good, ma&rsquo;am, I often says, for well you know that Sairey may be
      trusted not to give it back again. But I will not denige that I am
      worrited and wexed this day, and with good reagion, Lord forbid!&rsquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      By this time, Mrs Gamp (for it was no other than that experienced
      practitioner) had, with Tom&rsquo;s assistance, squeezed and worked herself into
      a small corner between Ruth and the rail; where, after breathing very hard
      for some little time, and performing a short series of dangerous
      evolutions with her umbrella, she managed to establish herself pretty
      comfortably.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;And which of all them smoking monsters is the Ankworks boat, I wonder.
      Goodness me!&rsquo; cried Mrs Gamp.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;What boat did you want?&rsquo; asked Ruth.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;The Ankworks package,&rsquo; Mrs Gamp replied. &lsquo;I will not deceive you, my
      sweet. Why should I?&rsquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;That is the Antwerp packet in the middle,&rsquo; said Ruth.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;And I wish it was in Jonadge&rsquo;s belly, I do,&rsquo; cried Mrs Gamp; appearing to
      confound the prophet with the whale in this miraculous aspiration.
    </p>
    <p>
      Ruth said nothing in reply; but, as Mrs Gamp, laying her chin against the
      cool iron of the rail, continued to look intently at the Antwerp boat, and
      every now and then to give a little groan, she inquired whether any child
      of hers was going aboard that morning? Or perhaps her husband, she said
      kindly.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Which shows,&rsquo; said Mrs Gamp, casting up her eyes, &lsquo;what a little way
      you&rsquo;ve travelled into this wale of life, my dear young creetur! As a good
      friend of mine has frequent made remark to me, which her name, my love, is
      Harris, Mrs Harris through the square and up the steps a-turnin&rsquo; round by
      the tobacker shop, &ldquo;Oh Sairey, Sairey, little do we know wot lays afore
      us!&rdquo; &ldquo;Mrs Harris, ma&rsquo;am,&rdquo; I says, &ldquo;not much, it&rsquo;s true, but more than you
      suppoge. Our calcilations, ma&rsquo;am,&rdquo; I says, &ldquo;respectin&rsquo; wot the number of a
      family will be, comes most times within one, and oftener than you would
      suppoge, exact.&rdquo; &ldquo;Sairey,&rdquo; says Mrs Harris, in a awful way, &ldquo;Tell me wot
      is my indiwidgle number.&rdquo; &ldquo;No, Mrs Harris,&rdquo; I says to her, &ldquo;ex-cuge me, if
      you please. My own,&rdquo; I says, &ldquo;has fallen out of three-pair backs, and had
      damp doorsteps settled on their lungs, and one was turned up smilin&rsquo; in a
      bedstead unbeknown. Therefore, ma&rsquo;am,&rdquo; I says, &ldquo;seek not to proticipate,
      but take &lsquo;em as they come and as they go.&rdquo; Mine,&rsquo; says Mrs Gamp, &lsquo;mine is
      all gone, my dear young chick. And as to husbands, there&rsquo;s a wooden leg
      gone likeways home to its account, which in its constancy of walkin&rsquo; into
      wine vaults, and never comin&rsquo; out again &lsquo;till fetched by force, was quite
      as weak as flesh, if not weaker.&rsquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      When she had delivered this oration, Mrs Gamp leaned her chin upon the
      cool iron again; and looking intently at the Antwerp packet, shook her
      head and groaned.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;I wouldn&rsquo;t,&rsquo; said Mrs Gamp, &lsquo;I wouldn&rsquo;t be a man and have such a think
      upon my mind!&mdash;but nobody as owned the name of man, could do it!&rsquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      Tom and his sister glanced at each other; and Ruth, after a moment&rsquo;s
      hesitation, asked Mrs Gamp what troubled her so much.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;My dear,&rsquo; returned that lady, dropping her voice, &lsquo;you are single, ain&rsquo;t
      you?&rsquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      Ruth laughed blushed, and said &lsquo;Yes.&rsquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Worse luck,&rsquo; proceeded Mrs Gamp, &lsquo;for all parties! But others is married,
      and in the marriage state; and there is a dear young creetur a-comin&rsquo; down
      this mornin&rsquo; to that very package, which is no more fit to trust herself
      to sea, than nothin&rsquo; is!&rsquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      She paused here to look over the deck of the packet in question, and on
      the steps leading down to it, and on the gangways. Seeming to have thus
      assured herself that the object of her commiseration had not yet arrived,
      she raised her eyes gradually up to the top of the escape-pipe, and
      indignantly apostrophised the vessel:
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Oh, drat you!&rsquo; said Mrs Gamp, shaking her umbrella at it, &lsquo;you&rsquo;re a nice
      spluttering nisy monster for a delicate young creetur to go and be a
      passinger by; ain&rsquo;t you! <i>you </i>never do no harm in that way, do you? With
      your hammering, and roaring, and hissing, and lamp-iling, you brute! Them
      Confugion steamers,&rsquo; said Mrs Gamp, shaking her umbrella again, &lsquo;has done
      more to throw us out of our reg&rsquo;lar work and bring ewents on at times when
      nobody counted on &lsquo;em (especially them screeching railroad ones), than all
      the other frights that ever was took. I have heerd of one young man, a
      guard upon a railway, only three years opened&mdash;well does Mrs Harris
      know him, which indeed he is her own relation by her sister&rsquo;s marriage
      with a master sawyer&mdash;as is godfather at this present time to
      six-and-twenty blessed little strangers, equally unexpected, and all on
      &lsquo;um named after the Ingeines as was the cause. Ugh!&rsquo; said Mrs Gamp,
      resuming her apostrophe, &lsquo;one might easy know you was a man&rsquo;s inwention,
      from your disregardlessness of the weakness of our naturs, so one might,
      you brute!&rsquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      It would not have been unnatural to suppose, from the first part of Mrs
      Gamp&rsquo;s lamentations, that she was connected with the stage-coaching or
      post-horsing trade. She had no means of judging of the effect of her
      concluding remarks upon her young companion; for she interrupted herself
      at this point, and exclaimed:
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;There she identically goes! Poor sweet young creetur, there she goes,
      like a lamb to the sacrifige! If there&rsquo;s any illness when that wessel gets
      to sea,&rsquo; said Mrs Gamp, prophetically, &lsquo;it&rsquo;s murder, and I&rsquo;m the witness
      for the persecution.&rsquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      She was so very earnest on the subject, that Tom&rsquo;s sister (being as kind
      as Tom himself) could not help saying something to her in reply.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Pray, which is the lady,&rsquo; she inquired, &lsquo;in whom you are so much
      interested?&rsquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;There!&rsquo; groaned Mrs Gamp. &lsquo;There she goes! A-crossin&rsquo; the little wooden
      bridge at this minute. She&rsquo;s a-slippin&rsquo; on a bit of orangepeel!&rsquo; tightly
      clutching her umbrella. &lsquo;What a turn it give me.&rsquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Do you mean the lady who is with that man wrapped up from head to foot in
      a large cloak, so that his face is almost hidden?&rsquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Well he may hide it!&rsquo; Mrs Gamp replied. &lsquo;He&rsquo;s good call to be ashamed of
      himself. Did you see him a-jerking of her wrist, then?&rsquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;He seems to be hasty with her, indeed.&rsquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Now he&rsquo;s a-taking of her down into the close cabin!&rsquo; said Mrs Gamp,
      impatiently. &lsquo;What&rsquo;s the man about! The deuce is in him, I think. Why
      can&rsquo;t he leave her in the open air?&rsquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      He did not, whatever his reason was, but led her quickly down and
      disappeared himself, without loosening his cloak, or pausing on the
      crowded deck one moment longer than was necessary to clear their way to
      that part of the vessel.
    </p>
    <p>
      Tom had not heard this little dialogue; for his attention had been engaged
      in an unexpected manner. A hand upon his sleeve had caused him to look
      round, just when Mrs Gamp concluded her apostrophe to the steam-engine;
      and on his right arm, Ruth being on his left, he found their landlord, to
      his great surprise.
    </p>
    <p>
      He was not so much surprised at the man&rsquo;s being there, as at his having
      got close to him so quietly and swiftly; for another person had been at
      his elbow one instant before; and he had not in the meantime been
      conscious of any change or pressure in the knot of people among whom he
      stood. He and Ruth had frequently remarked how noiselessly this landlord
      of theirs came into and went out of his own house; but Tom was not the
      less amazed to see him at his elbow now.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;I beg your pardon, Mr Pinch,&rsquo; he said in his ear. &lsquo;I am rather infirm,
      and out of breath, and my eyes are not very good. I am not as young as I
      was, sir. You don&rsquo;t see a gentleman in a large cloak down yonder, with a
      lady on his arm; a lady in a veil and a black shawl; do you?&rsquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      If <i>he</i> did not, it was curious that in speaking he should have singled out
      from all the crowd the very people whom he described; and should have
      glanced hastily from them to Tom, as if he were burning to direct his
      wandering eyes.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;A gentleman in a large cloak!&rsquo; said Tom, &lsquo;and a lady in a black shawl!
      Let me see!&rsquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Yes, yes!&rsquo; replied the other, with keen impatience. &lsquo;A gentleman muffled
      up from head to foot&mdash;strangely muffled up for such a morning as this&mdash;like
      an invalid, with his hand to his face at this minute, perhaps. No, no, no!
      not there,&rsquo; he added, following Tom&rsquo;s gaze; &lsquo;the other way; in that
      direction; down yonder.&rsquo; Again he indicated, but this time in his hurry,
      with his outstretched finger, the very spot on which the progress of these
      persons was checked at that moment.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;There are so many people, and so much motion, and so many objects,&rsquo; said
      Tom, &lsquo;that I find it difficult to&mdash;no, I really don&rsquo;t see a gentleman
      in a large cloak, and a lady in a black shawl. There&rsquo;s a lady in a red
      shawl over there!&rsquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;No, no, no!&rsquo; cried his landlord, pointing eagerly again, &lsquo;not there. The
      other way; the other way. Look at the cabin steps. To the left. They must
      be near the cabin steps. Do you see the cabin steps? There&rsquo;s the bell
      ringing already! <i>do</i> you see the steps?&rsquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Stay!&rsquo; said Tom, &lsquo;you&rsquo;re right. Look! there they go now. Is that the
      gentleman you mean? Descending at this minute, with the folds of a great
      cloak trailing down after him?&rsquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;The very man!&rsquo; returned the other, not looking at what Tom pointed out,
      however, but at Tom&rsquo;s own face. &lsquo;Will you do me a kindness, sir, a great
      kindness? Will you put that letter in his hand? Only give him that! He
      expects it. I am charged to do it by my employers, but I am late in
      finding him, and, not being as young as I have been, should never be able
      to make my way on board and off the deck again in time. Will you pardon my
      boldness, and do me that great kindness?&rsquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      His hands shook, and his face bespoke the utmost interest and agitation,
      as he pressed the letter upon Tom, and pointed to its destination, like
      the Tempter in some grim old carving.
    </p>
    <p>
      To hesitate in the performance of a good-natured or compassionate office
      was not in Tom&rsquo;s way. He took the letter; whispered Ruth to wait till he
      returned, which would be immediately; and ran down the steps with all the
      expedition he could make. There were so many people going down, so many
      others coming up, such heavy goods in course of transit to and fro, such a
      ringing of bell, blowing-off of steam, and shouting of men&rsquo;s voices, that
      he had much ado to force his way, or keep in mind to which boat he was
      going. But he reached the right one with good speed, and going down the
      cabin-stairs immediately, described the object of his search standing at
      the upper end of the saloon, with his back towards him, reading some
      notice which was hung against the wall. As Tom advanced to give him the
      letter, he started, hearing footsteps, and turned round.
    </p>
    <p>
      What was Tom&rsquo;s astonishment to find in him the man with whom he had had
      the conflict in the field&mdash;poor Mercy&rsquo;s husband. Jonas!
    </p>
    <p>
      Tom understood him to say, what the devil did he want; but it was not easy
      to make out what he said; he spoke so indistinctly.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;I want nothing with you for myself,&rsquo; said Tom; &lsquo;I was asked, a moment
      since, to give you this letter. You were pointed out to me, but I didn&rsquo;t
      know you in your strange dress. Take it!&rsquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      He did so, opened it, and read the writing on the inside. The contents
      were evidently very brief; not more perhaps than one line; but they struck
      upon him like a stone from a sling. He reeled back as he read.
    </p>
    <p>
      His emotion was so different from any Tom had ever seen before that he
      stopped involuntarily. Momentary as his state of indecision was, the bell
      ceased while he stood there, and a hoarse voice calling down the steps,
      inquired if there was any to go ashore?
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Yes,&rsquo; cried Jonas, &lsquo;I&mdash;I am coming. Give me time. Where&rsquo;s that
      woman! Come back; come back here.&rsquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      He threw open another door as he spoke, and dragged, rather than led, her
      forth. She was pale and frightened, and amazed to see her old
      acquaintance; but had no time to speak, for they were making a great stir
      above; and Jonas drew her rapidly towards the deck.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Where are we going? What is the matter?&rsquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;We are going back,&rsquo; said Jonas. &lsquo;I have changed my mind. I can&rsquo;t go.
      Don&rsquo;t question me, or I shall be the death of you, or some one else. Stop
      there! Stop! We&rsquo;re for the shore. Do you hear? We&rsquo;re for the shore!&rsquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      He turned, even in the madness of his hurry, and scowling darkly back at
      Tom, shook his clenched hand at him. There are not many human faces
      capable of the expression with which he accompanied that gesture.
    </p>
    <p>
      He dragged her up, and Tom followed them. Across the deck, over the side,
      along the crazy plank, and up the steps, he dragged her fiercely; not
      bestowing any look on her, but gazing upwards all the while among the
      faces on the wharf. Suddenly he turned again, and said to Tom with a
      tremendous oath:
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Where is he?&rsquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      Before Tom, in his indignation and amazement, could return an answer to a
      question he so little understood, a gentleman approached Tom behind, and
      saluted Jonas Chuzzlewit by name. He has a gentleman of foreign
      appearance, with a black moustache and whiskers; and addressed him with a
      polite composure, strangely different from his own distracted and
      desperate manner.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Chuzzlewit, my good fellow!&rsquo; said the gentleman, raising his hat in
      compliment to Mrs Chuzzlewit, &lsquo;I ask your pardon twenty thousand times. I
      am most unwilling to interfere between you and a domestic trip of this
      nature (always so very charming and refreshing, I know, although I have
      not the happiness to be a domestic man myself, which is the great
      infelicity of my existence); but the beehive, my dear friend, the beehive&mdash;will
      you introduce me?&rsquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;This is Mr Montague,&rsquo; said Jonas, whom the words appeared to choke.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;The most unhappy and most penitent of men, Mrs Chuzzlewit,&rsquo; pursued that
      gentleman, &lsquo;for having been the means of spoiling this excursion; but as I
      tell my friend, the beehive, the beehive. You projected a short little
      continental trip, my dear friend, of course?&rsquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      Jonas maintained a dogged silence.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;May I die,&rsquo; cried Montague, &lsquo;but I am shocked! Upon my soul I am shocked.
      But that confounded beehive of ours in the city must be paramount to every
      other consideration, when there is honey to be made; and that is my best
      excuse. Here is a very singular old female dropping curtseys on my right,&rsquo;
      said Montague, breaking off in his discourse, and looking at Mrs Gamp,
      &lsquo;who is not a friend of mine. Does anybody know her?&rsquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Ah! Well they knows me, bless their precious hearts!&rsquo; said Mrs Gamp, &lsquo;not
      forgettin&rsquo; your own merry one, sir, and long may it be so! Wishin&rsquo; as
      every one&rsquo; (she delivered this in the form of a toast or sentiment) &lsquo;was
      as merry, and as handsome-lookin&rsquo;, as a little bird has whispered me a
      certain gent is, which I will not name for fear I give offence where none
      is doo! My precious lady,&rsquo; here she stopped short in her merriment, for
      she had until now affected to be vastly entertained, &lsquo;you&rsquo;re too pale by
      half!&rsquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;<i>You </i>are here too, are you?&rsquo; muttered Jonas. &lsquo;Ecod, there are enough of
      you.&rsquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;I hope, sir,&rsquo; returned Mrs Gamp, dropping an indignant curtsey, &lsquo;as no
      bones is broke by me and Mrs Harris a-walkin&rsquo; down upon a public wharf.
      Which was the very words she says to me (although they was the last I ever
      had to speak) was these: &ldquo;Sairey,&rdquo; she says, &ldquo;is it a public wharf?&rdquo; &ldquo;Mrs
      Harris,&rdquo; I makes answer, &ldquo;can you doubt it? You have know&rsquo;d me now, ma&rsquo;am,
      eight and thirty year; and did you ever know me go, or wish to go, where I
      was not made welcome, say the words.&rdquo; &ldquo;No, Sairey,&rdquo; Mrs Harris says,
      &ldquo;contrairy quite.&rdquo; And well she knows it too. I am but a poor woman, but
      I&rsquo;ve been sought after, sir, though you may not think it. I&rsquo;ve been
      knocked up at all hours of the night, and warned out by a many landlords,
      in consequence of being mistook for Fire. I goes out workin&rsquo; for my bread,
      &lsquo;tis true, but I maintains my independency, with your kind leave, and
      which I will till death. I has my feelins as a woman, sir, and I have been
      a mother likeways; but touch a pipkin as belongs to me, or make the least
      remarks on what I eats or drinks, and though you was the favouritest young
      for&rsquo;ard hussy of a servant-gal as ever come into a house, either you
      leaves the place, or me. My earnins is not great, sir, but I will not be
      impoged upon. Bless the babe, and save the mother, is my mortar, sir; but
      I makes so free as add to that, Don&rsquo;t try no impogician with the Nuss, for
      she will not abear it!&rsquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      Mrs Gamp concluded by drawing her shawl tightly over herself with both
      hands, and, as usual, referring to Mrs Harris for full corroboration of
      these particulars. She had that peculiar trembling of the head which, in
      ladies of her excitable nature, may be taken as a sure indication of their
      breaking out again very shortly; when Jonas made a timely interposition.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;As you <i>are </i>here,&rsquo; he said, &lsquo;you had better see to her, and take her home.
      I am otherwise engaged.&rsquo; He said nothing more; but looked at Montague as
      if to give him notice that he was ready to attend him.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;I am sorry to take you away,&rsquo; said Montague.
    </p>
    <p>
      Jonas gave him a sinister look, which long lived in Tom&rsquo;s memory, and
      which he often recalled afterwards.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;I am, upon my life,&rsquo; said Montague. &lsquo;Why did you make it necessary?&rsquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      With the same dark glance as before, Jonas replied, after a moment&rsquo;s
      silence:
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;The necessity is none of my making. You have brought it about yourself.&rsquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      He said nothing more. He said even this as if he were bound, and in the
      other&rsquo;s power, but had a sullen and suppressed devil within him, which he
      could not quite resist. His very gait, as they walked away together, was
      like that of a fettered man; but, striving to work out at his clenched
      hands, knitted brows, and fast-set lips, was the same imprisoned devil
      still.
    </p>
    <p>
      They got into a handsome cabriolet which was waiting for them and drove
      away.
    </p>
    <p>
      The whole of this extraordinary scene had passed so rapidly and the tumult
      which prevailed around as so unconscious of any impression from it, that,
      although Tom had been one of the chief actors, it was like a dream. No one
      had noticed him after they had left the packet. He had stood behind Jonas,
      and so near him, that he could not help hearing all that passed. He had
      stood there, with his sister on his arm, expecting and hoping to have an
      opportunity of explaining his strange share in this yet stranger business.
      But Jonas had not raised his eyes from the ground; no one else had even
      looked towards him; and before he could resolve on any course of action,
      they were all gone.
    </p>
    <p>
      He gazed round for his landlord. But he had done that more than once
      already, and no such man was to be seen. He was still pursuing this search
      with his eyes, when he saw a hand beckoning to him from a hackney-coach;
      and hurrying towards it, found it was Merry&rsquo;s. She addressed him
      hurriedly, but bent out of the window, that she might not be overheard by
      her companion, Mrs Gamp.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;What is it?&rsquo; she said. &lsquo;Good heaven, what is it? Why did he tell me last
      night to prepare for a long journey, and why have you brought us back like
      criminals? Dear Mr Pinch!&rsquo; she clasped her hands distractedly, &lsquo;be
      merciful to us. Whatever this dreadful secret is, be merciful, and God
      will bless you!&rsquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;If any power of mercy lay with me,&rsquo; cried Tom, &lsquo;trust me, you shouldn&rsquo;t
      ask in vain. But I am far more ignorant and weak than you.&rsquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      She withdrew into the coach again, and he saw the hand waving towards him
      for a moment; but whether in reproachfulness or incredulity or misery, or
      grief, or sad adieu, or what else, he could not, being so hurried,
      understand. <i>She </i>was gone now; and Ruth and he were left to walk away, and
      wonder.
    </p>
    <p>
      Had Mr Nadgett appointed the man who never came, to meet him upon London
      Bridge that morning? He was certainly looking over the parapet, and down
      upon the steamboat-wharf at that moment. It could not have been for
      pleasure; he never took pleasure. No. He must have had some business
      there.

    <h2>
      CHAPTER FORTY-ONE
    </h2>
    <p>
      MR JONAS AND HIS FRIEND, ARRIVING AT A PLEASANT UNDERSTANDING, SET FORTH
      UPON AN ENTERPRISE
    </p>
    <p>
      The office of the Anglo-Bengalee Disinterested Loan and Life Assurance
      Company being near at hand, and Mr Montague driving Jonas straight there,
      they had very little way to go. But the journey might have been one of
      several hours&rsquo; duration, without provoking a remark from either; for it
      was clear that Jonas did not mean to break the silence which prevailed
      between them, and that it was not, as yet, his dear friend&rsquo;s cue to tempt
      them into conversation.
    </p>
    <p>
      He had thrown aside his cloak, as having now no motive for concealment,
      and with that garment huddled on his knees, sat as far removed from his
      companion as the limited space in such a carriage would allow. There was a
      striking difference in his manner, compared with what it had been, within
      a few minutes, when Tom encountered him so unexpectedly on board the
      packet, or when the ugly change had fallen on him in Mr Montague&rsquo;s
      dressing-room. He had the aspect of a man found out and held at bay; of
      being baffled, hunted, and beset; but there was now a dawning and
      increasing purpose in his face, which changed it very much. It was gloomy,
      distrustful, lowering; pale with anger and defeat; it still was humbled,
      abject, cowardly and mean; but, let the conflict go on as it would, there
      was one strong purpose wrestling with every emotion of his mind, and
      casting the whole series down as they arose.
    </p>
    <p>
      Not prepossessing in appearance at the best of times, it may be readily
      supposed that he was not so now. He had left deep marks of his front teeth
      in his nether lip; and those tokens of the agitation he had lately
      undergone improved his looks as little as the heavy corrugations in his
      forehead. But he was self-possessed now; unnaturally self-possessed,
      indeed, as men quite otherwise than brave are known to be in desperate
      extremities; and when the carriage stopped, he waited for no invitation,
      but leapt hardily out, and went upstairs.
    </p>
    <p>
      The chairman followed him; and closing the board-room door as soon as they
      had entered, threw himself upon a sofa. Jonas stood before the window,
      looking down into the street; and leaned against the sash, resting his
      head upon his arms.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;This is not handsome, Chuzzlewit!&rsquo; said Montague at length. &lsquo;Not handsome
      upon my soul!&rsquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;What would you have me do?&rsquo; he answered, looking round abruptly; &lsquo;What do
      you expect?&rsquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Confidence, my good fellow. Some confidence!&rsquo; said Montague in an injured
      tone.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Ecod! You show great confidence in me,&rsquo; retorted Jonas. &lsquo;Don&rsquo;t you?&rsquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Do I not?&rsquo; said his companion, raising his head, and looking at him, but
      he had turned again. &lsquo;Do I not? Have I not confided to you the easy
      schemes I have formed for our advantage; <i>our </i>advantage, mind; not mine
      alone; and what is my return? Attempted flight!&rsquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;How do you know that? Who said I meant to fly?&rsquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Who said? Come, come. A foreign boat, my friend, an early hour, a figure
      wrapped up for disguise! Who said? If you didn&rsquo;t mean to jilt me, why were
      you there? If you didn&rsquo;t mean to jilt me, why did you come back?&rsquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;I came back,&rsquo; said Jonas, &lsquo;to avoid disturbance.&rsquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;You were wise,&rsquo; rejoined his friend.
    </p>
    <p>
      Jonas stood quite silent; still looking down into the street, and resting
      his head upon his arms.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Now, Chuzzlewit,&rsquo; said Montague, &lsquo;notwithstanding what has passed I will
      be plain with you. Are you attending to me there? I only see your back.&rsquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;I hear you. Go on!&rsquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;I say that notwithstanding what has passed, I will be plain with you.&rsquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;You said that before. And I have told you once I heard you say it. Go
      on.&rsquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;You are a little chafed, but I can make allowance for that, and am,
      fortunately, myself in the very best of tempers. Now, let us see how
      circumstances stand. A day or two ago, I mentioned to you, my dear fellow,
      that I thought I had discovered&mdash;&rsquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Will you hold your tongue?&rsquo; said Jonas, looking fiercely round, and
      glancing at the door.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Well, well!&rsquo; said Montague. &lsquo;Judicious! Quite correct! My discoveries
      being published, would be like many other men&rsquo;s discoveries in this honest
      world; of no further use to me. You see, Chuzzlewit, how ingenuous and
      frank I am in showing you the weakness of my own position! To return. I
      make, or think I make, a certain discovery which I take an early
      opportunity of mentioning in your ear, in that spirit of confidence which
      I really hoped did prevail between us, and was reciprocated by you.
      Perhaps there is something in it; perhaps there is nothing. I have my
      knowledge and opinion on the subject. You have yours. We will not discuss
      the question. But, my good fellow, you have been weak; what I wish to
      point out to you is, that you have been weak. I may desire to turn this
      little incident to my account (indeed, I do&mdash;I&rsquo;ll not deny it), but
      my account does not lie in probing it, or using it against you.&rsquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;What do you call using it against me?&rsquo; asked Jonas, who had not yet
      changed his attitude.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Oh!&rsquo; said Montague, with a laugh. &lsquo;We&rsquo;ll not enter into that.&rsquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Using it to make a beggar of me. Is that the use you mean?&rsquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;No.&rsquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Ecod,&rsquo; muttered Jonas, bitterly. &lsquo;That&rsquo;s the use in which your account
      <i>does </i>lie. You speak the truth there.&rsquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;I wish you to venture (it&rsquo;s a very safe venture) a little more with us,
      certainly, and to keep quiet,&rsquo; said Montague. &lsquo;You promised me you would;
      and you must. I say it plainly, Chuzzlewit, you <i>must</i>. Reason the matter.
      If you don&rsquo;t, my secret is worthless to me: and being so, it may as well
      become the public property as mine; better, for I shall gain some credit,
      bringing it to light. I want you, besides, to act as a decoy in a case I
      have already told you of. You don&rsquo;t mind that, I know. You care nothing
      for the man (you care nothing for any man; you are too sharp; so am I, I
      hope); and could bear any loss of his with pious fortitude. Ha, ha, ha!
      You have tried to escape from the first consequence. You cannot escape it,
      I assure you. I have shown you that to-day. Now, I am not a moral man, you
      know. I am not the least in the world affected by anything you may have
      done; by any little indiscretion you may have committed; but I wish to
      profit by it if I can; and to a man of your intelligence I make that free
      confession. I am not at all singular in that infirmity. Everybody profits
      by the indiscretion of his neighbour; and the people in the best repute,
      the most. Why do you give me this trouble? It must come to a friendly
      agreement, or an unfriendly crash. It must. If the former, you are very
      little hurt. If the latter&mdash;well! you know best what is likely to
      happen then.&rsquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      Jonas left the window, and walked up close to him. He did not look him in
      the face; it was not his habit to do that; but he kept his eyes towards
      him&mdash;on his breast, or thereabouts&mdash;and was at great pains to
      speak slowly and distinctly in reply. Just as a man in a state of
      conscious drunkenness might be.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Lying is of no use now,&rsquo; he said. &lsquo;I <i>did </i>think of getting away this
      morning, and making better terms with you from a distance.&rsquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;To be sure! to be sure!&rsquo; replied Montague. &lsquo;Nothing more natural. I
      foresaw that, and provided against it. But I am afraid I am interrupting
      you.&rsquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;How the devil,&rsquo; pursued Jonas, with a still greater effort, &lsquo;you made
      choice of your messenger, and where you found him, I&rsquo;ll not ask you. I
      owed him one good turn before to-day. If you are so careless of men in
      general, as you said you were just now, you are quite indifferent to what
      becomes of such a crop-tailed cur as that, and will leave me to settle my
      account with him in my own manner.&rsquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      If he had raised his eyes to his companion&rsquo;s face, he would have seen that
      Montague was evidently unable to comprehend his meaning. But continuing to
      stand before him, with his furtive gaze directed as before, and pausing
      here only to moisten his dry lips with his tongue, the fact was lost upon
      him. It might have struck a close observer that this fixed and steady
      glance of Jonas&rsquo;s was a part of the alteration which had taken place in
      his demeanour. He kept it riveted on one spot, with which his thoughts had
      manifestly nothing to do; like as a juggler walking on a cord or wire to
      any dangerous end, holds some object in his sight to steady him, and never
      wanders from it, lest he trip.
    </p>
    <p>
      Montague was quick in his rejoinder, though he made it at a venture. There
      was no difference of opinion between him and his friend on <i>that </i>point. Not
      the least.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Your great discovery,&rsquo; Jonas proceeded, with a savage sneer that got the
      better of him for the moment, &lsquo;may be true, and may be false. Whichever it
      is, I dare say I&rsquo;m no worse than other men.&rsquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Not a bit,&rsquo; said Tigg. &lsquo;Not a bit. We&rsquo;re all alike&mdash;or nearly so.&rsquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;I want to know this,&rsquo; Jonas went on to say; &lsquo;is it your own? You&rsquo;ll not
      wonder at my asking the question.&rsquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;My own!&rsquo; repeated Montague.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Aye!&rsquo; returned the other, gruffly. &lsquo;Is it known to anybody else? Come!
      Don&rsquo;t waver about that.&rsquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;No!&rsquo; said Montague, without the smallest hesitation. &lsquo;What would it be
      worth, do you think, unless I had the keeping of it?&rsquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      Now, for the first time, Jonas looked at him. After a pause, he put out
      his hand, and said, with a laugh:
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Come! make things easy to me, and I&rsquo;m yours. I don&rsquo;t know that I may not
      be better off here, after all, than if I had gone away this morning. But
      here I am, and here I&rsquo;ll stay now. Take your oath!&rsquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      He cleared his throat, for he was speaking hoarsely and said in a lighter
      tone:
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Shall I go to Pecksniff? When? Say when!&rsquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Immediately!&rsquo; cried Montague. &lsquo;He cannot be enticed too soon.&rsquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Ecod!&rsquo; cried Jonas, with a wild laugh. &lsquo;There&rsquo;s some fun in catching that
      old hypocrite. I hate him. Shall I go to-night?&rsquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Aye! This,&rsquo; said Montague, ecstatically, &lsquo;is like business! We understand
      each other now! To-night, my good fellow, by all means.&rsquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Come with me,&rsquo; cried Jonas. &lsquo;We must make a dash; go down in state, and
      carry documents, for he&rsquo;s a deep file to deal with, and must be drawn on
      with an artful hand, or he&rsquo;ll not follow. I know him. As I can&rsquo;t take your
      lodgings or your dinners down, I must take you. Will you come to-night?&rsquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      His friend appeared to hesitate; and neither to have anticipated this
      proposal, nor to relish it very much.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;We can concert our plans upon the road,&rsquo; said Jonas. &lsquo;We must not go
      direct to him, but cross over from some other place, and turn out of our
      way to see him. I may not want to introduce you, but I must have you on
      the spot. I know the man, I tell you.&rsquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;But what if the man knows me?&rsquo; said Montague, shrugging his shoulders.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;He know!&rsquo; cried Jonas. &lsquo;Don&rsquo;t you run that risk with fifty men a day!
      Would your father know you? Did I know you? Ecod! You were another figure
      when I saw you first. Ha, ha, ha! I see the rents and patches now! No
      false hair then, no black dye! You were another sort of joker in those
      days, you were! You even spoke different then. You&rsquo;ve acted the gentleman
      so seriously since, that you&rsquo;ve taken in yourself. If he should know you,
      what does it matter? Such a change is a proof of your success. You know
      that, or you would not have made yourself known to me. Will you come?&rsquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;My good fellow,&rsquo; said Montague, still hesitating, &lsquo;I can trust you
      alone.&rsquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Trust me! Ecod, you may trust me now, far enough. I&rsquo;ll try to go away no
      more&mdash;no more!&rsquo; He stopped, and added in a more sober tone, &lsquo;I can&rsquo;t
      get on without you. Will you come?&rsquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;I will,&rsquo; said Montague, &lsquo;if that&rsquo;s your opinion.&rsquo; And they shook hands
      upon it.
    </p>
    <p>
      The boisterous manner which Jonas had exhibited during the latter part of
      this conversation, and which had gone on rapidly increasing with almost
      every word he had spoken, from the time when he looked his honourable
      friend in the face until now, did not now subside, but, remaining at its
      height, abided by him. Most unusual with him at any period; most
      inconsistent with his temper and constitution; especially unnatural it
      would appear in one so darkly circumstanced; it abided by him. It was not
      like the effect of wine, or any ardent drink, for he was perfectly
      coherent. It even made him proof against the usual influence of such means
      of excitement; for, although he drank deeply several times that day, with
      no reserve or caution, he remained exactly the same man, and his spirits
      neither rose nor fell in the least observable degree.
    </p>
    <p>
      Deciding, after some discussion, to travel at night, in order that the
      day&rsquo;s business might not be broken in upon, they took counsel together in
      reference to the means. Mr Montague being of opinion that four horses were
      advisable, at all events for the first stage, as throwing a great deal of
      dust into people&rsquo;s eyes, in more senses than one, a travelling chariot and
      four lay under orders for nine o&rsquo;clock. Jonas did not go home; observing,
      that his being obliged to leave town on business in so great a hurry,
      would be a good excuse for having turned back so unexpectedly in the
      morning. So he wrote a note for his portmanteau, and sent it by a
      messenger, who duly brought his luggage back, with a short note from that
      other piece of luggage, his wife, expressive of her wish to be allowed to
      come and see him for a moment. To this request he sent for answer, &lsquo;she
      had better;&rsquo; and one such threatening affirmative being sufficient, in
      defiance of the English grammar, to express a negative, she kept away.
    </p>
    <p>
      Mr Montague being much engaged in the course of the day, Jonas bestowed
      his spirits chiefly on the doctor, with whom he lunched in the medical
      officer&rsquo;s own room. On his way thither, encountering Mr Nadgett in the
      outer room, he bantered that stealthy gentleman on always appearing
      anxious to avoid him, and inquired if he were afraid of him. Mr Nadgett
      slyly answered, &lsquo;No, but he believed it must be his way as he had been
      charged with much the same kind of thing before.&rsquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      Mr Montague was listening to, or, to speak with greater elegance, he
      overheard, this dialogue. As soon as Jonas was gone he beckoned Nadgett to
      him with the feather of his pen, and whispered in his ear.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Who gave him my letter this morning?&rsquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;My lodger, sir,&rsquo; said Nadgett, behind the palm of his hand.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;How came that about?&rsquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;I found him on the wharf, sir. Being so much hurried, and you not
      arrived, it was necessary to do something. It fortunately occurred to me,
      that if I gave it him myself I could be of no further use. I should have
      been blown upon immediately.&rsquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Mr Nadgett, you are a jewel,&rsquo; said Montague, patting him on the back.
      &lsquo;What&rsquo;s your lodger&rsquo;s name?&rsquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Pinch, sir. Thomas Pinch.&rsquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      Montague reflected for a little while, and then asked:
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;From the country, do you know?&rsquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;From Wiltshire, sir, he told me.&rsquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      They parted without another word. To see Mr Nadgett&rsquo;s bow when Montague
      and he next met, and to see Mr Montague acknowledge it, anybody might have
      undertaken to swear that they had never spoken to each other
      confidentially in all their lives.
    </p>
    <p>
      In the meanwhile, Mr Jonas and the doctor made themselves very comfortable
      upstairs, over a bottle of the old Madeira and some sandwiches; for the
      doctor having been already invited to dine below at six o&rsquo;clock, preferred
      a light repast for lunch. It was advisable, he said, in two points of
      view: First, as being healthy in itself. Secondly as being the better
      preparation for dinner.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;And you are bound for all our sakes to take particular care of your
      digestion, Mr Chuzzlewit, my dear sir,&rsquo; said the doctor smacking his lips
      after a glass of wine; &lsquo;for depend upon it, it is worth preserving. It
      must be in admirable condition, sir; perfect chronometer-work. Otherwise
      your spirits could not be so remarkable. Your bosom&rsquo;s lord sits lightly on
      its throne, Mr Chuzzlewit, as what&rsquo;s-his-name says in the play. I wish he
      said it in a play which did anything like common justice to our
      profession, by the bye. There is an apothecary in that drama, sir, which
      is a low thing; vulgar, sir; out of nature altogether.&rsquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      Mr Jobling pulled out his shirt-frill of fine linen, as though he would
      have said, &lsquo;This is what I call nature in a medical man, sir;&rsquo; and looked
      at Jonas for an observation.
    </p>
    <p>
      Jonas not being in a condition to pursue the subject, took up a case of
      lancets that was lying on the table, and opened it.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Ah!&rsquo; said the doctor, leaning back in his chair, &lsquo;I always take &lsquo;em out
      of my pocket before I eat. My pockets are rather tight. Ha, ha, ha!&rsquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      Jonas had opened one of the shining little instruments; and was
      scrutinizing it with a look as sharp and eager as its own bright edge.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Good steel, doctor. Good steel! Eh!&rsquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Ye-es,&rsquo; replied the doctor, with the faltering modesty of ownership. &lsquo;One
      might open a vein pretty dexterously with that, Mr Chuzzlewit.&rsquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;It has opened a good many in its time, I suppose?&rsquo; said Jonas looking at
      it with a growing interest.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Not a few, my dear sir, not a few. It has been engaged in a&mdash;in a
      pretty good practice, I believe I may say,&rsquo; replied the doctor, coughing
      as if the matter-of-fact were so very dry and literal that he couldn&rsquo;t
      help it. &lsquo;In a pretty good practice,&rsquo; repeated the doctor, putting another
      glass of wine to his lips.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Now, could you cut a man&rsquo;s throat with such a thing as this?&rsquo; demanded
      Jonas.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Oh certainly, certainly, if you took him in the right place,&rsquo; returned
      the doctor. &lsquo;It all depends upon that.&rsquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Where you have your hand now, hey?&rsquo; cried Jonas, bending forward to look
      at it.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Yes,&rsquo; said the doctor; &lsquo;that&rsquo;s the jugular.&rsquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      Jonas, in his vivacity, made a sudden sawing in the air, so close behind
      the doctor&rsquo;s jugular that he turned quite red. Then Jonas (in the same
      strange spirit of vivacity) burst into a loud discordant laugh.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;No, no,&rsquo; said the doctor, shaking his head; &lsquo;edge tools, edge tools;
      never play with &lsquo;em. A very remarkable instance of the skillful use of
      edge-tools, by the way, occurs to me at this moment. It was a case of
      murder. I am afraid it was a case of murder, committed by a member of our
      profession; it was so artistically done.&rsquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Aye!&rsquo; said Jonas. &lsquo;How was that?&rsquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Why, sir,&rsquo; returned Jobling, &lsquo;the thing lies in a nutshell. A certain
      gentleman was found, one morning, in an obscure street, lying in an angle
      of a doorway&mdash;I should rather say, leaning, in an upright position,
      in the angle of a doorway, and supported consequently by the doorway. Upon
      his waistcoat there was one solitary drop of blood. He was dead and cold;
      and had been murdered, sir.&rsquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Only one drop of blood!&rsquo; said Jonas.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Sir, that man,&rsquo; replied the doctor, &lsquo;had been stabbed to the heart. Had
      been stabbed to the heart with such dexterity, sir, that he had died
      instantly, and had bled internally. It was supposed that a medical friend
      of his (to whom suspicion attached) had engaged him in conversation on
      some pretence; had taken him, very likely, by the button in a
      conversational manner; had examined his ground at leisure with his other
      hand; had marked the exact spot; drawn out the instrument, whatever it
      was, when he was quite prepared; and&mdash;&rsquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;And done the trick,&rsquo; suggested Jonas.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Exactly so,&rsquo; replied the doctor. &lsquo;It was quite an operation in its way,
      and very neat. The medical friend never turned up; and, as I tell you, he
      had the credit of it. Whether he did it or not I can&rsquo;t say. But, having
      had the honour to be called in with two or three of my professional
      brethren on the occasion, and having assisted to make a careful
      examination of the wound, I have no hesitation in saying that it would
      have reflected credit on any medical man; and that in an unprofessional
      person it could not but be considered, either as an extraordinary work of
      art, or the result of a still more extraordinary, happy, and favourable
      conjunction of circumstances.&rsquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      His hearer was so much interested in this case, that the doctor went on to
      elucidate it with the assistance of his own finger and thumb and
      waistcoat; and at Jonas&rsquo;s request, he took the further trouble of going
      into a corner of the room, and alternately representing the murdered man
      and the murderer; which he did with great effect. The bottle being emptied
      and the story done, Jonas was in precisely the same boisterous and unusual
      state as when they had sat down. If, as Jobling theorized, his good
      digestion were the cause, he must have been a very ostrich.
    </p>
    <p>
      At dinner it was just the same; and after dinner too; though wine was
      drunk in abundance, and various rich meats eaten. At nine o&rsquo;clock it was
      still the same. There being a lamp in the carriage, he swore they would
      take a pack of cards, and a bottle of wine; and with these things under
      his cloak, went down to the door.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Out of the way, Tom Thumb, and get to bed!&rsquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      This was the salutation he bestowed on Mr Bailey, who, booted and wrapped
      up, stood at the carriage door to help him in.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;To bed, sir! I&rsquo;m a-going, too,&rsquo; said Bailey.
    </p>
    <p>
      He alighted quickly, and walked back into the hall, where Montague was
      lighting a cigar; conducting Mr Bailey with him, by the collar.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;You are not a-going to take this monkey of a boy, are you?&rsquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Yes,&rsquo; said Montague.
    </p>
    <p>
      He gave the boy a shake, and threw him roughly aside. There was more of
      his familiar self in the action, than in anything he had done that day;
      but he broke out laughing immediately afterwards, and making a thrust at
      the doctor with his hand, in imitation of his representation of the
      medical friend, went out to the carriage again, and took his seat. His
      companion followed immediately. Mr Bailey climbed into the rumble. &lsquo;It
      will be a stormy night!&rsquo; exclaimed the doctor, as they started.

    <h2>
      CHAPTER FORTY-TWO
    </h2>
    <h3>
      CONTINUATION OF THE ENTERPRISE OF MR JONAS AND HIS FRIEND
    </h3>
    <p>
      The doctor&rsquo;s prognostication in reference to the weather was speedily
      verified. Although the weather was not a patient of his, and no third
      party had required him to give an opinion on the case, the quick
      fulfilment of his prophecy may be taken as an instance of his professional
      tact; for, unless the threatening aspect of the night had been perfectly
      plain and unmistakable, Mr Jobling would never have compromised his
      reputation by delivering any sentiments on the subject. He used this
      principle in Medicine with too much success to be unmindful of it in his
      commonest transactions.
    </p>
    <p>
      It was one of those hot, silent nights, when people sit at windows
      listening for the thunder which they know will shortly break; when they
      recall dismal tales of hurricanes and earthquakes; and of lonely
      travellers on open plains, and lonely ships at sea, struck by lightning.
      Lightning flashed and quivered on the black horizon even now; and hollow
      murmurings were in the wind, as though it had been blowing where the
      thunder rolled, and still was charged with its exhausted echoes. But the
      storm, though gathering swiftly, had not yet come up; and the prevailing
      stillness was the more solemn, from the dull intelligence that seemed to
      hover in the air, of noise and conflict afar off.
    </p>
    <p>
      It was very dark; but in the murky sky there were masses of cloud which
      shone with a lurid light, like monstrous heaps of copper that had been
      heated in a furnace, and were growing cold. These had been advancing
      steadily and slowly, but they were now motionless, or nearly so. As the
      carriage clattered round the corners of the streets, it passed at every
      one a knot of persons who had come there&mdash;many from their houses
      close at hand, without hats&mdash;to look up at that quarter of the sky.
      And now a very few large drops of rain began to fall, and thunder rumbled
      in the distance.
    </p>
    <p>
      Jonas sat in a corner of the carriage with his bottle resting on his knee,
      and gripped as tightly in his hand as if he would have ground its neck to
      powder if he could. Instinctively attracted by the night, he had laid
      aside the pack of cards upon the cushion; and with the same involuntary
      impulse, so intelligible to both of them as not to occasion a remark on
      either side, his companion had extinguished the lamp. The front glasses
      were down; and they sat looking silently out upon the gloomy scene before
      them.
    </p>
    <p>
      They were clear of London, or as clear of it as travellers can be whose
      way lies on the Western Road, within a stage of that enormous city.
      Occasionally they encountered a foot-passenger, hurrying to the nearest
      place of shelter; or some unwieldy cart proceeding onward at a heavy trot,
      with the same end in view. Little clusters of such vehicles were gathered
      round the stable-yard or baiting-place of every wayside tavern; while
      their drivers watched the weather from the doors and open windows, or made
      merry within. Everywhere the people were disposed to bear each other
      company rather than sit alone; so that groups of watchful faces seemed to
      be looking out upon the night <i>and them</i>, from almost every house they
      passed.
    </p>
    <p>
      It may appear strange that this should have disturbed Jonas, or rendered
      him uneasy; but it did. After muttering to himself, and often changing his
      position, he drew up the blind on his side of the carriage, and turned his
      shoulder sulkily towards it. But he neither looked at his companion, nor
      broke the silence which prevailed between them, and which had fallen so
      suddenly upon himself, by addressing a word to him.
    </p>
    <p>
      The thunder rolled, the lightning flashed; the rain poured down like
      Heaven&rsquo;s wrath. Surrounded at one moment by intolerable light, and at the
      next by pitchy darkness, they still pressed forward on their journey. Even
      when they arrived at the end of the stage, and might have tarried, they
      did not; but ordered horses out immediately. Nor had this any reference to
      some five minutes&rsquo; lull, which at that time seemed to promise a cessation
      of the storm. They held their course as if they were impelled and driven
      by its fury. Although they had not exchanged a dozen words, and might have
      tarried very well, they seemed to feel, by joint consent, that onward they
      must go.
    </p>
    <p>
      Louder and louder the deep thunder rolled, as through the myriad halls of
      some vast temple in the sky; fiercer and brighter became the lightning,
      more and more heavily the rain poured down. The horses (they were
      travelling now with a single pair) plunged and started from the rills of
      quivering fire that seemed to wind along the ground before them; but there
      these two men sat, and forward they went as if they were led on by an
      invisible attraction.
    </p>
    <p>
      The eye, partaking of the quickness of the flashing light, saw in its
      every gleam a multitude of objects which it could not see at steady noon
      in fifty times that period. Bells in steeples, with the rope and wheel
      that moved them; ragged nests of birds in cornices and nooks; faces full
      of consternation in the tilted waggons that came tearing past; their
      frightened teams ringing out a warning which the thunder drowned; harrows
      and ploughs left out in fields; miles upon miles of hedge-divided country,
      with the distant fringe of trees as obvious as the scarecrow in the
      bean-field close at hand; in a trembling, vivid, flickering instant,
      everything was clear and plain; then came a flush of red into the yellow
      light; a change to blue; a brightness so intense that there was nothing
      else but light; and then the deepest and profoundest darkness.
    </p>
    <p>
      The lightning being very crooked and very dazzling may have presented or
      assisted a curious optical illusion, which suddenly rose before the
      startled eyes of Montague in the carriage, and as rapidly disappeared. He
      thought he saw Jonas with his hand lifted, and the bottle clenched in it
      like a hammer, making as if he would aim a blow at his head. At the same
      time he observed (or so believed) an expression in his face&mdash;a
      combination of the unnatural excitement he had shown all day, with a wild
      hatred and fear&mdash;which might have rendered a wolf a less terrible
      companion.
    </p>
    <p>
      He uttered an involuntary exclamation, and called to the driver, who
      brought his horses to a stop with all speed.
    </p>
    <p>
      It could hardly have been as he supposed, for although he had not taken
      his eyes off his companion, and had not seen him move, he sat reclining in
      his corner as before.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;What&rsquo;s the matter?&rsquo; said Jonas. &lsquo;Is that your general way of waking out
      of your sleep?&rsquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;I could swear,&rsquo; returned the other, &lsquo;that I have not closed my eyes!&rsquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;When you have sworn it,&rsquo; said Jonas, composedly, &lsquo;we had better go on
      again, if you have only stopped for that.&rsquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      He uncorked the bottle with the help of his teeth; and putting it to his
      lips, took a long draught.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;I wish we had never started on this journey. This is not,&rsquo; said Montague,
      recoiling instinctively, and speaking in a voice that betrayed his
      agitation; &lsquo;this is not a night to travel in.&rsquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Ecod! you&rsquo;re right there,&rsquo; returned Jonas, &lsquo;and we shouldn&rsquo;t be out in it
      but for you. If you hadn&rsquo;t kept me waiting all day, we might have been at
      Salisbury by this time; snug abed and fast asleep. What are we stopping
      for?&rsquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      His companion put his head out of window for a moment, and drawing it in
      again, observed (as if that were his cause of anxiety), that the boy was
      drenched to the skin.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Serve him right,&rsquo; said Jonas. &lsquo;I&rsquo;m glad of it. What the devil are we
      stopping for? Are you going to spread him out to dry?&rsquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;I have half a mind to take him inside,&rsquo; observed the other with some
      hesitation.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Oh! thankee!&rsquo; said Jonas. &lsquo;We don&rsquo;t want any damp boys here; especially a
      young imp like him. Let him be where he is. He ain&rsquo;t afraid of a little
      thunder and lightning, I dare say; whoever else is. Go on, driver. We had
      better have <i>him </i>inside perhaps,&rsquo; he muttered with a laugh; &lsquo;and the
      horses!&rsquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Don&rsquo;t go too fast,&rsquo; cried Montague to the postillion; &lsquo;and take care how
      you go. You were nearly in the ditch when I called to you.&rsquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      This was not true; and Jonas bluntly said so, as they moved forward again.
      Montague took little or no heed of what he said, but repeated that it was
      not a night for travelling, and showed himself, both then and afterwards,
      unusually anxious.
    </p>
    <p>
      From this time Jonas recovered his former spirits, if such a term may be
      employed to express the state in which he had left the city. He had his
      bottle often at his mouth; roared out snatches of songs, without the least
      regard to time or tune or voice, or anything but loud discordance; and
      urged his silent friend to be merry with him.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;You&rsquo;re the best company in the world, my good fellow,&rsquo; said Montague with
      an effort, &lsquo;and in general irresistible; but to-night&mdash;do you hear
      it?&rsquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Ecod! I hear and see it too,&rsquo; cried Jonas, shading his eyes, for the
      moment, from the lightning which was flashing, not in any one direction,
      but all around them. &lsquo;What of that? It don&rsquo;t change you, nor me, nor our
      affairs. Chorus, chorus,
    </p>
<pre xml:space="preserve">
              It may lighten and storm,
              Till it hunt the red worm
     From the grass where the gibbet is driven;
              But it can&rsquo;t hurt the dead,
              And it won&rsquo;t save the head
     That is doom&rsquo;d to be rifled and riven.
</pre>
    <p>
      That must be a precious old song,&rsquo; he added with an oath, as he stopped
      short in a kind of wonder at himself. &lsquo;I haven&rsquo;t heard it since I was a
      boy, and how it comes into my head now, unless the lightning put it there,
      I don&rsquo;t know. &ldquo;Can&rsquo;t hurt the dead&rdquo;! No, no. &ldquo;And won&rsquo;t save the head&rdquo;!
      No, no. No! Ha, ha, ha!&rsquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      His mirth was of such a savage and extraordinary character, and was, in an
      inexplicable way, at once so suited to the night, and yet such a coarse
      intrusion on its terrors, that his fellow-traveller, always a coward,
      shrunk from him in positive fear. Instead of Jonas being his tool and
      instrument, their places seemed to be reversed. But there was reason for
      this too, Montague thought; since the sense of his debasement might
      naturally inspire such a man with the wish to assert a noisy independence,
      and in that licence to forget his real condition. Being quick enough, in
      reference to such subjects of contemplation, he was not long in taking
      this argument into account and giving it its full weight. But still, he
      felt a vague sense of alarm, and was depressed and uneasy.
    </p>
    <p>
      He was certain he had not been asleep; but his eyes might have deceived
      him; for, looking at Jonas now in any interval of darkness, he could
      represent his figure to himself in any attitude his state of mind
      suggested. On the other hand, he knew full well that Jonas had no reason
      to love him; and even taking the piece of pantomime which had so impressed
      his mind to be a real gesture, and not the working of his fancy, the most
      that could be said of it was, that it was quite in keeping with the rest
      of his diabolical fun, and had the same impotent expression of truth in
      it. &lsquo;If he could kill me with a wish,&rsquo; thought the swindler, &lsquo;I should not
      live long.&rsquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      He resolved that when he should have had his use of Jonas, he would
      restrain him with an iron curb; in the meantime, that he could not do
      better than leave him to take his own way, and preserve his own peculiar
      description of good-humour, after his own uncommon manner. It was no great
      sacrifice to bear with him; &lsquo;for when all is got that can be got,&rsquo; thought
      Montague, &lsquo;I shall decamp across the water, and have the laugh on my side&mdash;and
      the gains.&rsquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      Such were his reflections from hour to hour; his state of mind being one
      in which the same thoughts constantly present themselves over and over
      again in wearisome repetition; while Jonas, who appeared to have dismissed
      reflection altogether, entertained himself as before. They agreed that
      they would go to Salisbury, and would cross to Mr Pecksniff&rsquo;s in the
      morning; and at the prospect of deluding that worthy gentleman, the
      spirits of his amiable son-in-law became more boisterous than ever.
    </p>
    <p>
      As the night wore on, the thunder died away, but still rolled gloomily and
      mournfully in the distance. The lightning too, though now comparatively
      harmless, was yet bright and frequent. The rain was quite as violent as it
      had ever been.
    </p>
    <p>
      It was their ill-fortune, at about the time of dawn and in the last stage
      of their journey, to have a restive pair of horses. These animals had been
      greatly terrified in their stable by the tempest; and coming out into the
      dreary interval between night and morning, when the glare of the lightning
      was yet unsubdued by day, and the various objects in their view were
      presented in indistinct and exaggerated shapes which they would not have
      worn by night, they gradually became less and less capable of control;
      until, taking a sudden fright at something by the roadside, they dashed
      off wildly down a steep hill, flung the driver from his saddle, drew the
      carriage to the brink of a ditch, stumbled headlong down, and threw it
      crashing over.
    </p>
<div class="fig" style="width:65%">

    <h5>
      <a href="images/20661.jpg"><i>Original</i></a>
    </h5>
    <p>
      The travellers had opened the carriage door, and had either jumped or
      fallen out. Jonas was the first to stagger to his feet. He felt sick and
      weak, and very giddy, and reeling to a five-barred gate, stood holding by
      it; looking drowsily about as the whole landscape swam before his eyes.
      But, by degrees, he grew more conscious, and presently observed that
      Montague was lying senseless in the road, within a few feet of the horses.
    </p>
    <p>
      In an instant, as if his own faint body were suddenly animated by a demon,
      he ran to the horses&rsquo; heads; and pulling at their bridles with all his
      force, set them struggling and plunging with such mad violence as brought
      their hoofs at every effort nearer to the skull of the prostrate man; and
      must have led in half a minute to his brains being dashed out on the
      highway.
    </p>
    <p>
      As he did this, he fought and contended with them like a man possessed,
      making them wilder by his cries.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Whoop!&rsquo; cried Jonas. &lsquo;Whoop! again! another! A little more, a little
      more! Up, ye devils! Hillo!&rsquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      As he heard the driver, who had risen and was hurrying up, crying to him
      to desist, his violence increased.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Hiilo! Hillo!&rsquo; cried Jonas.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;For God&rsquo;s sake!&rsquo; cried the driver. &lsquo;The gentleman&mdash;in the road&mdash;he&rsquo;ll
      be killed!&rsquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      The same shouts and the same struggles were his only answer. But the man
      darting in at the peril of his own life, saved Montague&rsquo;s, by dragging him
      through the mire and water out of the reach of present harm. That done, he
      ran to Jonas; and with the aid of his knife they very shortly disengaged
      the horses from the broken chariot, and got them, cut and bleeding, on
      their legs again. The postillion and Jonas had now leisure to look at each
      other, which they had not had yet.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Presence of mind, presence of mind!&rsquo; cried Jonas, throwing up his hands
      wildly. &lsquo;What would you have done without me?&rsquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;The other gentleman would have done badly without <i>me</i>,&rsquo; returned the man,
      shaking his head. &lsquo;You should have moved him first. I gave him up for
      dead.&rsquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Presence of mind, you croaker, presence of mind&rsquo; cried Jonas with a harsh
      loud laugh. &lsquo;Was he struck, do you think?&rsquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      They both turned to look at him. Jonas muttered something to himself, when
      he saw him sitting up beneath the hedge, looking vacantly around.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;What&rsquo;s the matter?&rsquo; asked Montague. &lsquo;Is anybody hurt?&rsquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Ecod!&rsquo; said Jonas, &lsquo;it don&rsquo;t seem so. There are no bones broken, after
      all.&rsquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      They raised him, and he tried to walk. He was a good deal shaken, and
      trembled very much. But with the exception of a few cuts and bruises this
      was all the damage he had sustained.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Cuts and bruises, eh?&rsquo; said Jonas. &lsquo;We&rsquo;ve all got them. Only cuts and
      bruises, eh?&rsquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;I wouldn&rsquo;t have given sixpence for the gentleman&rsquo;s head in half-a-dozen
      seconds more, for all he&rsquo;s only cut and bruised,&rsquo; observed the post-boy.
      &lsquo;If ever you&rsquo;re in an accident of this sort again, sir; which I hope you
      won&rsquo;t be; never you pull at the bridle of a horse that&rsquo;s down, when
      there&rsquo;s a man&rsquo;s head in the way. That can&rsquo;t be done twice without there
      being a dead man in the case; it would have ended in that, this time, as
      sure as ever you were born, if I hadn&rsquo;t come up just when I did.&rsquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      Jonas replied by advising him with a curse to hold his tongue, and to go
      somewhere, whither he was not very likely to go of his own accord. But
      Montague, who had listened eagerly to every word, himself diverted the
      subject, by exclaiming: &lsquo;Where&rsquo;s the boy?&rsquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Ecod! I forgot that monkey,&rsquo; said Jonas. &lsquo;What&rsquo;s become of him?&rsquo; A very
      brief search settled that question. The unfortunate Mr Bailey had been
      thrown sheer over the hedge or the five-barred gate; and was lying in the
      neighbouring field, to all appearance dead.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;When I said to-night, that I wished I had never started on this journey,&rsquo;
      cried his master, &lsquo;I knew it was an ill-fated one. Look at this boy!&rsquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Is that all?&rsquo; growled Jonas. &lsquo;If you call <i>that </i>a sign of it&mdash;&rsquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Why, what should I call a sign of it?&rsquo; asked Montague, hurriedly. &lsquo;What
      do you mean?&rsquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;I mean,&rsquo; said Jonas, stooping down over the body, &lsquo;that I never heard you
      were his father, or had any particular reason to care much about him.
      Halloa. Hold up there!&rsquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      But the boy was past holding up, or being held up, or giving any other
      sign of life than a faint and fitful beating of the heart. After some
      discussion the driver mounted the horse which had been least injured, and
      took the lad in his arms as well as he could; while Montague and Jonas,
      leading the other horse, and carrying a trunk between them, walked by his
      side towards Salisbury.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;You&rsquo;d get there in a few minutes, and be able to send assistance to meet
      us, if you went forward, post-boy,&rsquo; said Jonas. &lsquo;Trot on!&rsquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;No, no,&rsquo; cried Montague; &lsquo;we&rsquo;ll keep together.&rsquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Why, what a chicken you are! You are not afraid of being robbed; are
      you?&rsquo; said Jonas.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;I am not afraid of anything,&rsquo; replied the other, whose looks and manner
      were in flat contradiction to his words. &lsquo;But we&rsquo;ll keep together.&rsquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;You were mighty anxious about the boy, a minute ago,&rsquo; said Jonas. &lsquo;I
      suppose you know that he may die in the meantime?&rsquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Aye, aye. I know. But we&rsquo;ll keep together.&rsquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      As it was clear that he was not to be moved from this determination, Jonas
      made no other rejoinder than such as his face expressed; and they
      proceeded in company. They had three or four good miles to travel; and the
      way was not made easier by the state of the road, the burden by which they
      were embarrassed, or their own stiff and sore condition. After a
      sufficiently long and painful walk, they arrived at the Inn; and having
      knocked the people up (it being yet very early in the morning), sent out
      messengers to see to the carriage and its contents, and roused a surgeon
      from his bed to tend the chief sufferer. All the service he could render,
      he rendered promptly and skillfully. But he gave it as his opinion that
      the boy was labouring under a severe concussion of the brain, and that Mr
      Bailey&rsquo;s mortal course was run.
    </p>
    <p>
      If Montague&rsquo;s strong interest in the announcement could have been
      considered as unselfish in any degree, it might have been a redeeming
      trait in a character that had no such lineaments to spare. But it was not
      difficult to see that, for some unexpressed reason best appreciated by
      himself, he attached a strange value to the company and presence of this
      mere child. When, after receiving some assistance from the surgeon
      himself, he retired to the bedroom prepared for him, and it was broad day,
      his mind was still dwelling on this theme.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;I would rather have lost,&rsquo; he said, &lsquo;a thousand pounds than lost the boy
      just now. But I&rsquo;ll return home alone. I am resolved upon that. Chuzzlewit
      shall go forward first, and I will follow in my own time. I&rsquo;ll have no
      more of this,&rsquo; he added, wiping his damp forehead. &lsquo;Twenty-four hours of
      this would turn my hair grey!&rsquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      After examining his chamber, and looking under the bed, and in the
      cupboards, and even behind the curtains, with unusual caution (although it
      was, as has been said, broad day), he double-locked the door by which he
      had entered, and retired to rest. There was another door in the room, but
      it was locked on the outer side; and with what place it communicated, he
      knew not.
    </p>
    <p>
      His fears or evil conscience reproduced this door in all his dreams. He
      dreamed that a dreadful secret was connected with it; a secret which he
      knew, and yet did not know, for although he was heavily responsible for
      it, and a party to it, he was harassed even in his vision by a distracting
      uncertainty in reference to its import. Incoherently entwined with this
      dream was another, which represented it as the hiding-place of an enemy, a
      shadow, a phantom; and made it the business of his life to keep the
      terrible creature closed up, and prevent it from forcing its way in upon
      him. With this view Nadgett, and he, and a strange man with a bloody smear
      upon his head (who told him that he had been his playfellow, and told him,
      too, the real name of an old schoolmate, forgotten until then), worked
      with iron plates and nails to make the door secure; but though they worked
      never so hard, it was all in vain, for the nails broke, or changed to soft
      twigs, or what was worse, to worms, between their fingers; the wood of the
      door splintered and crumbled, so that even nails would not remain in it;
      and the iron plates curled up like hot paper. All this time the creature
      on the other side&mdash;whether it was in the shape of man, or beast, he
      neither knew nor sought to know&mdash;was gaining on them. But his
      greatest terror was when the man with the bloody smear upon his head
      demanded of him if he knew this creatures name, and said that he would
      whisper it. At this the dreamer fell upon his knees, his whole blood
      thrilling with inexplicable fear, and held his ears. But looking at the
      speaker&rsquo;s lips, he saw that they formed the utterance of the letter &lsquo;J&rsquo;;
      and crying out aloud that the secret was discovered, and they were all
      lost, he awoke.
    </p>
    <p>
      Awoke to find Jonas standing at his bedside watching him. And that very
      door wide open.
    </p>
    <p>
      As their eyes met, Jonas retreated a few paces, and Montague sprang out of
      bed.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Heyday!&rsquo; said Jonas. &lsquo;You&rsquo;re all alive this morning.&rsquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Alive!&rsquo; the other stammered, as he pulled the bell-rope violently. &lsquo;What
      are you doing here?&rsquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;It&rsquo;s your room to be sure,&rsquo; said Jonas; &lsquo;but I&rsquo;m almost inclined to ask
      you what <i>you </i>are doing here? My room is on the other side of that door. No
      one told me last night not to open it. I thought it led into a passage,
      and was coming out to order breakfast. There&rsquo;s&mdash;there&rsquo;s no bell in my
      room.&rsquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      Montague had in the meantime admitted the man with his hot water and
      boots, who hearing this, said, yes, there was; and passed into the
      adjoining room to point it out, at the head of the bed.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;I couldn&rsquo;t find it, then,&rsquo; said Jonas; &lsquo;it&rsquo;s all the same. Shall I order
      breakfast?&rsquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      Montague answered in the affirmative. When Jonas had retired, whistling,
      through his own room, he opened the door of communication, to take out the
      key and fasten it on the inner side. But it was taken out already.
    </p>
    <p>
      He dragged a table against the door, and sat down to collect himself, as
      if his dreams still had some influence upon his mind.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;An evil journey,&rsquo; he repeated several times. &lsquo;An evil journey. But I&rsquo;ll
      travel home alone. I&rsquo;ll have no more of this.&rsquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      His presentiment, or superstition, that it was an evil journey, did not at
      all deter him from doing the evil for which the journey was undertaken.
      With this in view, he dressed himself more carefully than usual to make a
      favourable impression on Mr Pecksniff; and, reassured by his own
      appearance, the beauty of the morning, and the flashing of the wet boughs
      outside his window in the merry sunshine, was soon sufficiently inspirited
      to swear a few round oaths, and hum the fag-end of a song.
    </p>
    <p>
      But he still muttered to himself at intervals, for all that: &lsquo;I&rsquo;ll travel
      home alone!&rsquo;

    <p>
      HAS AN INFLUENCE ON THE FORTUNES OF SEVERAL PEOPLE. MR PECKSNIFF IS
      EXHIBITED IN THE PLENITUDE OF POWER; AND WIELDS THE SAME WITH FORTITUDE
      AND MAGNANIMITY
    </p>
    <p>
      On the night of the storm, Mrs Lupin, hostess of the Blue Dragon, sat by
      herself in her little bar. Her solitary condition, or the bad weather, or
      both united, made Mrs Lupin thoughtful, not to say sorrowful. As she sat
      with her chin upon her hand, looking out through a low back lattice,
      rendered dim in the brightest day-time by clustering vine-leaves, she
      shook her head very often, and said, &lsquo;Dear me! Oh, dear, dear me!&rsquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      It was a melancholy time, even in the snugness of the Dragon bar. The rich
      expanse of corn-field, pasture-land, green slope, and gentle undulation,
      with its sparkling brooks, its many hedgerows, and its clumps of beautiful
      trees, was black and dreary, from the diamond panes of the lattice away to
      the far horizon, where the thunder seemed to roll along the hills. The
      heavy rain beat down the tender branches of vine and jessamine, and
      trampled on them in its fury; and when the lightning gleamed it showed the
      tearful leaves shivering and cowering together at the window, and tapping
      at it urgently, as if beseeching to be sheltered from the dismal night.
    </p>
    <p>
      As a mark of her respect for the lightning, Mrs Lupin had removed her
      candle to the chimney-piece. Her basket of needle-work stood unheeded at
      her elbow; her supper, spread on a round table not far off, was untasted;
      and the knives had been removed for fear of attraction. She had sat for a
      long time with her chin upon her hand, saying to herself at intervals,
      &lsquo;Dear me! Ah, dear, dear me!&rsquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      She was on the eve of saying so, once more, when the latch of the
      house-door (closed to keep the rain out), rattled on its well-worn catch,
      and a traveller came in, who, shutting it after him, and walking straight
      up to the half-door of the bar, said, rather gruffly:
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;A pint of the best old beer here.&rsquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      He had some reason to be gruff, for if he had passed the day in a
      waterfall, he could scarcely have been wetter than he was. He was wrapped
      up to the eyes in a rough blue sailor&rsquo;s coat, and had an oil-skin hat on,
      from the capacious brim of which the rain fell trickling down upon his
      breast, and back, and shoulders. Judging from a certain liveliness of chin&mdash;he
      had so pulled down his hat, and pulled up his collar, to defend himself
      from the weather, that she could only see his chin, and even across that
      he drew the wet sleeve of his shaggy coat, as she looked at him&mdash;Mrs
      Lupin set him down for a good-natured fellow, too.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;A bad night!&rsquo; observed the hostess cheerfully.
    </p>
    <p>
      The traveller shook himself like a Newfoundland dog, and said it was,
      rather.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;There&rsquo;s a fire in the kitchen,&rsquo; said Mrs Lupin, &lsquo;and very good company
      there. Hadn&rsquo;t you better go and dry yourself?&rsquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;No, thankee,&rsquo; said the man, glancing towards the kitchen as he spoke; he
      seemed to know the way.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;It&rsquo;s enough to give you your death of cold,&rsquo; observed the hostess.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;I don&rsquo;t take my death easy,&rsquo; returned the traveller; &lsquo;or I should most
      likely have took it afore to-night. Your health, ma&rsquo;am!&rsquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      Mrs Lupin thanked him; but in the act of lifting the tankard to his mouth,
      he changed his mind, and put it down again. Throwing his body back, and
      looking about him stiffly, as a man does who is wrapped up, and has his
      hat low down over his eyes, he said:
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;What do you call this house? Not the Dragon, do you?&rsquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      Mrs Lupin complacently made answer, &lsquo;Yes, the Dragon.&rsquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Why, then, you&rsquo;ve got a sort of a relation of mine here, ma&rsquo;am,&rsquo; said the
      traveller; &lsquo;a young man of the name of Tapley. What! Mark, my boy!&rsquo;
      apostrophizing the premises, &lsquo;have I come upon you at last, old buck!&rsquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      This was touching Mrs Lupin on a tender point. She turned to trim the
      candle on the chimney-piece, and said, with her back towards the
      traveller:
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Nobody should be made more welcome at the Dragon, master, than any one
      who brought me news of Mark. But it&rsquo;s many and many a long day and month
      since he left here and England. And whether he&rsquo;s alive or dead, poor
      fellow, Heaven above us only knows!&rsquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      She shook her head, and her voice trembled; her hand must have done so
      too, for the light required a deal of trimming.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Where did he go, ma&rsquo;am?&rsquo; asked the traveller, in a gentler voice.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;He went,&rsquo; said Mrs Lupin, with increased distress, &lsquo;to America. He was
      always tender-hearted and kind, and perhaps at this moment may be lying in
      prison under sentence of death, for taking pity on some miserable black,
      and helping the poor runaway creetur to escape. How could he ever go to
      America! Why didn&rsquo;t he go to some of those countries where the savages eat
      each other fairly, and give an equal chance to every one!&rsquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      Quite subdued by this time, Mrs Lupin sobbed, and was retiring to a chair
      to give her grief free vent, when the traveller caught her in his arms,
      and she uttered a glad cry of recognition.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Yes, I will!&rsquo; cried Mark, &lsquo;another&mdash;one more&mdash;twenty more! You
      didn&rsquo;t know me in that hat and coat? I thought you would have known me
      anywheres! Ten more!&rsquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;So I should have known you, if I could have seen you; but I couldn&rsquo;t, and
      you spoke so gruff. I didn&rsquo;t think you could speak gruff to me, Mark, at
      first coming back.&rsquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Fifteen more!&rsquo; said Mr Tapley. &lsquo;How handsome and how young you look! Six
      more! The last half-dozen warn&rsquo;t a fair one, and must be done over again.
      Lord bless you, what a treat it is to see you! One more! Well, I never was
      so jolly. Just a few more, on account of there not being any credit in
      it!&rsquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      When Mr Tapley stopped in these calculations in simple addition, he did
      it, not because he was at all tired of the exercise, but because he was
      out of breath. The pause reminded him of other duties.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Mr Martin Chuzzlewit&rsquo;s outside,&rsquo; he said. &lsquo;I left him under the cartshed,
      while I came on to see if there was anybody here. We want to keep quiet
      to-night, till we know the news from you, and what it&rsquo;s best for us to
      do.&rsquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;There&rsquo;s not a soul in the house, except the kitchen company,&rsquo; returned
      the hostess. &lsquo;If they were to know you had come back, Mark, they&rsquo;d have a
      bonfire in the street, late as it is.&rsquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;But they mustn&rsquo;t know it to-night, my precious soul,&rsquo; said Mark; &lsquo;so have
      the house shut, and the kitchen fire made up; and when it&rsquo;s all ready, put
      a light in the winder, and we&rsquo;ll come in. One more! I long to hear about
      old friends. You&rsquo;ll tell me all about &lsquo;em, won&rsquo;t you; Mr Pinch, and the
      butcher&rsquo;s dog down the street, and the terrier over the way, and the
      wheelwright&rsquo;s, and every one of &lsquo;em. When I first caught sight of the
      church to-night, I thought the steeple would have choked me, I did. One
      more! Won&rsquo;t you? Not a very little one to finish off with?&rsquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;You have had plenty, I am sure,&rsquo; said the hostess. &lsquo;Go along with your
      foreign manners!&rsquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;That ain&rsquo;t foreign, bless you!&rsquo; cried Mark. &lsquo;Native as oysters, that is!
      One more, because it&rsquo;s native! As a mark of respect for the land we live
      in! This don&rsquo;t count as between you and me, you understand,&rsquo; said Mr
      Tapley. &lsquo;I ain&rsquo;t a-kissing you now, you&rsquo;ll observe. I have been among the
      patriots; I&rsquo;m a-kissin&rsquo; my country.&rsquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      It would have been very unreasonable to complain of the exhibition of his
      patriotism with which he followed up this explanation, that it was at all
      lukewarm or indifferent. When he had given full expression to his
      nationality, he hurried off to Martin; while Mrs Lupin, in a state of
      great agitation and excitement, prepared for their reception.
    </p>
    <p>
      The company soon came tumbling out; insisting to each other that the
      Dragon clock was half an hour too fast, and that the thunder must have
      affected it. Impatient, wet, and weary though they were, Martin and Mark
      were overjoyed to see these old faces, and watched them with delighted
      interest as they departed from the house, and passed close by them.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;There&rsquo;s the old tailor, Mark!&rsquo; whispered Martin.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;There he goes, sir! A little bandier than he was, I think, sir, ain&rsquo;t he?
      His figure&rsquo;s so far altered, as it seems to me, that you might wheel a
      rather larger barrow between his legs as he walks, than you could have
      done conveniently when we know&rsquo;d him. There&rsquo;s Sam a-coming out, sir.&rsquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Ah, to be sure!&rsquo; cried Martin; &lsquo;Sam, the hostler. I wonder whether that
      horse of Pecksniff&rsquo;s is alive still?&rsquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Not a doubt on it, sir,&rsquo; returned Mark. &lsquo;That&rsquo;s a description of animal,
      sir, as will go on in a bony way peculiar to himself for a long time, and
      get into the newspapers at last under the title of &ldquo;Sing&rsquo;lar Tenacity of
      Life in a Quadruped.&rdquo; As if he had ever been alive in all his life, worth
      mentioning! There&rsquo;s the clerk, sir&mdash;wery drunk, as usual.&rsquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;I see him!&rsquo; said Martin, laughing. &lsquo;But, my life, how wet you are, Mark!&rsquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;I am! What do you consider yourself, sir?&rsquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Oh, not half as bad,&rsquo; said his fellow-traveller, with an air of great
      vexation. &lsquo;I told you not to keep on the windy side, Mark, but to let us
      change and change about. The rain has been beating on you ever since it
      began.&rsquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;You don&rsquo;t know how it pleases me, sir,&rsquo; said Mark, after a short silence,
      &lsquo;if I may make so bold as say so, to hear you a-going on in that there
      uncommon considerate way of yours; which I don&rsquo;t mean to attend to, never,
      but which, ever since that time when I was floored in Eden, you have
      showed.&rsquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Ah, Mark!&rsquo; sighed Martin, &lsquo;the less we say of that the better. Do I see
      the light yonder?&rsquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;That&rsquo;s the light!&rsquo; cried Mark. &lsquo;Lord bless her, what briskness she
      possesses! Now for it, sir. Neat wines, good beds, and first-rate
      entertainment for man or beast.&rsquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      The kitchen fire burnt clear and red, the table was spread out, the kettle
      boiled; the slippers were there, the boot-jack too, sheets of ham were
      there, cooking on the gridiron; half-a-dozen eggs were there, poaching in
      the frying-pan; a plethoric cherry-brandy bottle was there, winking at a
      foaming jug of beer upon the table; rare provisions were there, dangling
      from the rafters as if you had only to open your mouth, and something
      exquisitely ripe and good would be glad of the excuse for tumbling into
      it. Mrs Lupin, who for their sakes had dislodged the very cook, high
      priestess of the temple, with her own genial hands was dressing their
      repast.
    </p>
    <p>
      It was impossible to help it&mdash;a ghost must have hugged her. The
      Atlantic Ocean and the Red Sea being, in that respect, all one, Martin
      hugged her instantly. Mr Tapley (as if the idea were quite novel, and had
      never occurred to him before), followed, with much gravity, on the same
      side.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Little did I ever think,&rsquo; said Mrs Lupin, adjusting her cap and laughing
      heartily; yes, and blushing too; &lsquo;often as I have said that Mr Pecksniff&rsquo;s
      young gentlemen were the life and soul of the Dragon, and that without
      them it would be too dull to live in&mdash;little did I ever think I am
      sure, that any one of them would ever make so free as you, Mr Martin! And
      still less that I shouldn&rsquo;t be angry with him, but should be glad with all
      my heart to be the first to welcome him home from America, with Mark
      Tapley for his&mdash;&rsquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;For his friend, Mrs Lupin,&rsquo; interposed Martin.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;For his friend,&rsquo; said the hostess, evidently gratified by this
      distinction, but at the same time admonishing Mr Tapley with a fork to
      remain at a respectful distance. &lsquo;Little did I ever think that! But still
      less, that I should ever have the changes to relate that I shall have to
      tell you of, when you have done your supper!&rsquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Good Heaven!&rsquo; cried Martin, changing colour, &lsquo;what changes?&rsquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;<i>She</i>,&rsquo; said the hostess, &lsquo;is quite well, and now at Mr Pecksniff&rsquo;s. Don&rsquo;t
      be at all alarmed about her. She is everything you could wish. It&rsquo;s of no
      use mincing matters, or making secrets, is it?&rsquo; added Mrs Lupin. &lsquo;I know
      all about it, you see!&rsquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;My good creature,&rsquo; returned Martin, &lsquo;you are exactly the person who ought
      to know all about it. I am delighted to think you <i>do</i> know about that! But
      what changes do you hint at? Has any death occurred?&rsquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;No, no!&rsquo; said the hostess. &lsquo;Not as bad as that. But I declare now that I
      will not be drawn into saying another word till you have had your supper.
      If you ask me fifty questions in the meantime, I won&rsquo;t answer one.&rsquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      She was so positive, that there was nothing for it but to get the supper
      over as quickly as possible; and as they had been walking a great many
      miles, and had fasted since the middle of the day, they did no great
      violence to their own inclinations in falling on it tooth and nail. It
      took rather longer to get through than might have been expected; for,
      half-a-dozen times, when they thought they had finished, Mrs Lupin exposed
      the fallacy of that impression triumphantly. But at last, in the course of
      time and nature, they gave in. Then, sitting with their slippered feet
      stretched out upon the kitchen hearth (which was wonderfully comforting,
      for the night had grown by this time raw and chilly), and looking with
      involuntary admiration at their dimpled, buxom, blooming hostess, as the
      firelight sparkled in her eyes and glimmered in her raven hair, they
      composed themselves to listen to her news.
    </p>
    <p>
      Many were the exclamations of surprise which interrupted her, when she
      told them of the separation between Mr Pecksniff and his daughters, and
      between the same good gentleman and Mr Pinch. But these were nothing to
      the indignant demonstrations of Martin, when she related, as the common
      talk of the neighbourhood, what entire possession he had obtained over the
      mind and person of old Mr Chuzzlewit, and what high honour he designed for
      Mary. On receipt of this intelligence, Martin&rsquo;s slippers flew off in a
      twinkling, and he began pulling on his wet boots with that indefinite
      intention of going somewhere instantly, and doing something to somebody,
      which is the first safety-valve of a hot temper.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;He!&rsquo; said Martin, &lsquo;smooth-tongued villain that he is! He! Give me that
      other boot, Mark?&rsquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Where was you a-thinking of going to, sir?&rsquo; inquired Mr Tapley drying the
      sole at the fire, and looking coolly at it as he spoke, as if it were a
      slice of toast.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Where!&rsquo; repeated Martin. &lsquo;You don&rsquo;t suppose I am going to remain here, do
      you?&rsquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      The imperturbable Mark confessed that he did.
    </p>
    <p>
      You do!&rsquo; retorted Martin angrily. &lsquo;I am much obliged to you. What do you
      take me for?&rsquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;I take you for what you are, sir,&rsquo; said Mark; &lsquo;and, consequently, am
      quite sure that whatever you do will be right and sensible. The boot,
      sir.&rsquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      Martin darted an impatient look at him, without taking it, and walked
      rapidly up and down the kitchen several times, with one boot and a
      stocking on. But, mindful of his Eden resolution, he had already gained
      many victories over himself when Mark was in the case, and he resolved to
      conquer now. So he came back to the book-jack, laid his hand on Mark&rsquo;s
      shoulder to steady himself, pulled the boot off, picked up his slippers,
      put them on, and sat down again. He could not help thrusting his hands to
      the very bottom of his pockets, and muttering at intervals, &lsquo;Pecksniff
      too! That fellow! Upon my soul! In-deed! What next?&rsquo; and so forth; nor
      could he help occasionally shaking his fist at the chimney, with a very
      threatening countenance; but this did not last long; and he heard Mrs
      Lupin out, if not with composure, at all events in silence.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;As to Mr Pecksniff himself,&rsquo; observed the hostess in conclusion,
      spreading out the skirts of her gown with both hands, and nodding her head
      a great many times as she did so, &lsquo;I don&rsquo;t know what to say. Somebody must
      have poisoned his mind, or influenced him in some extraordinary way. I
      cannot believe that such a noble-spoken gentleman would go and do wrong of
      his own accord!&rsquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      A noble-spoken gentleman! How many people are there in the world, who, for
      no better reason, uphold their Pecksniffs to the last and abandon virtuous
      men, when Pecksniffs breathe upon them!
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;As to Mr Pinch,&rsquo; pursued the landlady, &lsquo;if ever there was a dear, good,
      pleasant, worthy soul alive, Pinch, and no other, is his name. But how do
      we know that old Mr Chuzzlewit himself was not the cause of difference
      arising between him and Mr Pecksniff? No one but themselves can tell; for
      Mr Pinch has a proud spirit, though he has such a quiet way; and when he
      left us, and was so sorry to go, he scorned to make his story good, even
      to me.&rsquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Poor old Tom!&rsquo; said Martin, in a tone that sounded like remorse.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;It&rsquo;s a comfort to know,&rsquo; resumed the landlady, &lsquo;that he has his sister
      living with him, and is doing well. Only yesterday he sent me back, by
      post, a little&rsquo;&mdash;here the colour came into her cheeks&mdash;&lsquo;a little
      trifle I was bold enough to lend him when he went away; saying, with many
      thanks, that he had good employment, and didn&rsquo;t want it. It was the same
      note; he hadn&rsquo;t broken it. I never thought I could have been so little
      pleased to see a bank-note come back to me as I was to see that.&rsquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Kindly said, and heartily!&rsquo; said Martin. &lsquo;Is it not, Mark?&rsquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;She can&rsquo;t say anything as does not possess them qualities,&rsquo; returned Mr
      Tapley; &lsquo;which as much belongs to the Dragon as its licence. And now that
      we have got quite cool and fresh, to the subject again, sir; what will you
      do? If you&rsquo;re not proud, and can make up your mind to go through with what
      you spoke of, coming along, that&rsquo;s the course for you to take. If you
      started wrong with your grandfather (which, you&rsquo;ll excuse my taking the
      liberty of saying, appears to have been the case), up with you, sir, and
      tell him so, and make an appeal to his affections. Don&rsquo;t stand out. He&rsquo;s a
      great deal older than you, and if he was hasty, you was hasty too. Give
      way, sir, give way.&rsquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      The eloquence of Mr Tapley was not without its effect on Martin but he
      still hesitated, and expressed his reason thus:
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;That&rsquo;s all very true, and perfectly correct, Mark; and if it were a mere
      question of humbling myself before <i>him</i>, I would not consider it twice. But
      don&rsquo;t you see, that being wholly under this hypocrite&rsquo;s government, and
      having (if what we hear be true) no mind or will of his own, I throw
      myself, in fact, not at his feet, but at the feet of Mr Pecksniff? And
      when I am rejected and spurned away,&rsquo; said Martin, turning crimson at the
      thought, &lsquo;it is not by him; my own blood stirred against me; but by
      Pecksniff&mdash;Pecksniff, Mark!&rsquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Well, but we know beforehand,&rsquo; returned the politic Mr Tapley, &lsquo;that
      Pecksniff is a wagabond, a scoundrel, and a willain.&rsquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;A most pernicious villain!&rsquo; said Martin.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;A most pernicious willain. We know that beforehand, sir; and,
      consequently, it&rsquo;s no shame to be defeated by Pecksniff. Blow Pecksniff!&rsquo;
      cried Mr Tapley, in the fervour of his eloquence. &lsquo;Who&rsquo;s he! It&rsquo;s not in
      the natur of Pecksniff to shame <i>us</i>, unless he agreed with us, or done us a
      service; and, in case he offered any audacity of that description, we
      could express our sentiments in the English language, I hope. Pecksniff!&rsquo;
      repeated Mr Tapley, with ineffable disdain. &lsquo;What&rsquo;s Pecksniff, who&rsquo;s
      Pecksniff, where&rsquo;s Pecksniff, that he&rsquo;s to be so much considered? We&rsquo;re
      not a-calculating for ourselves;&rsquo; he laid uncommon emphasis on the last
      syllable of that word, and looked full in Martin&rsquo;s face; &lsquo;we&rsquo;re making a
      effort for a young lady likewise as has undergone her share; and whatever
      little hope we have, this here Pecksniff is not to stand in its way, I
      expect. I never heard of any act of Parliament, as was made by Pecksniff.
      Pecksniff! Why, I wouldn&rsquo;t see the man myself; I wouldn&rsquo;t hear him; I
      wouldn&rsquo;t choose to know he was in company. I&rsquo;d scrape my shoes on the
      scraper of the door, and call that Pecksniff, if you liked; but I wouldn&rsquo;t
      condescend no further.&rsquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      The amazement of Mrs Lupin, and indeed of Mr Tapley himself for that
      matter, at this impassioned flow of language, was immense. But Martin,
      after looking thoughtfully at the fire for a short time, said:
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;You are right, Mark. Right or wrong, it shall be done. I&rsquo;ll do it.&rsquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;One word more, sir,&rsquo; returned Mark. &lsquo;Only think of him so far as not to
      give him a handle against you. Don&rsquo;t you do anything secret that he can
      report before you get there. Don&rsquo;t you even see Miss Mary in the morning,
      but let this here dear friend of ours&rsquo;&mdash;Mr Tapley bestowed a smile
      upon the hostess&mdash;&lsquo;prepare her for what&rsquo;s a-going to happen, and
      carry any little message as may be agreeable. She knows how. Don&rsquo;t you?&rsquo;
      Mrs Lupin laughed and tossed her head. &lsquo;Then you go in, bold and free as a
      gentleman should. &ldquo;I haven&rsquo;t done nothing under-handed,&rdquo; says you. &ldquo;I
      haven&rsquo;t been skulking about the premises, here I am, for-give me, I ask
      your pardon, God Bless You!&rdquo;&rsquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      Martin smiled, but felt that it was good advice notwithstanding, and
      resolved to act upon it. When they had ascertained from Mrs Lupin that
      Pecksniff had already returned from the great ceremonial at which they had
      beheld him in his glory; and when they had fully arranged the order of
      their proceedings; they went to bed, intent upon the morrow.
    </p>
    <p>
      In pursuance of their project as agreed upon at this discussion, Mr Tapley
      issued forth next morning, after breakfast, charged with a letter from
      Martin to his grandfather, requesting leave to wait upon him for a few
      minutes. And postponing as he went along the congratulations of his
      numerous friends until a more convenient season, he soon arrived at Mr
      Pecksniff&rsquo;s house. At that gentleman&rsquo;s door; with a face so immovable that
      it would have been next to an impossibility for the most acute
      physiognomist to determine what he was thinking about, or whether he was
      thinking at all; he straightway knocked.
    </p>
    <p>
      A person of Mr Tapley&rsquo;s observation could not long remain insensible to
      the fact that Mr Pecksniff was making the end of his nose very blunt
      against the glass of the parlour window, in an angular attempt to discover
      who had knocked at the door. Nor was Mr Tapley slow to baffle this
      movement on the part of the enemy, by perching himself on the top step,
      and presenting the crown of his hat in that direction. But possibly Mr
      Pecksniff had already seen him, for Mark soon heard his shoes creaking, as
      he advanced to open the door with his own hands.
    </p>
    <p>
      Mr Pecksniff was as cheerful as ever, and sang a little song in the
      passage.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;How d&rsquo;ye do, sir?&rsquo; said Mark.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Oh!&rsquo; cried Mr Pecksniff. &lsquo;Tapley, I believe? The Prodigal returned! We
      don&rsquo;t want any beer, my friend.&rsquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Thankee, sir,&rsquo; said Mark. &lsquo;I couldn&rsquo;t accommodate you if you did. A
      letter, sir. Wait for an answer.&rsquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;For me?&rsquo; cried Mr Pecksniff. &lsquo;And an answer, eh?&rsquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Not for you, I think, sir,&rsquo; said Mark, pointing out the direction.
      &lsquo;Chuzzlewit, I believe the name is, sir.&rsquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Oh!&rsquo; returned Mr Pecksniff. &lsquo;Thank you. Yes. Who&rsquo;s it from, my good young
      man?&rsquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;The gentleman it comes from wrote his name inside, sir,&rsquo; returned Mr
      Tapley with extreme politeness. &lsquo;I see him a-signing of it at the end,
      while I was a-waitin&rsquo;.&rsquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;And he said he wanted an answer, did he?&rsquo; asked Mr Pecksniff in his most
      persuasive manner.
    </p>
    <p>
      Mark replied in the affirmative.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;He shall have an answer. Certainly,&rsquo; said Mr Pecksniff, tearing the
      letter into small pieces, as mildly as if that were the most flattering
      attention a correspondent could receive. &lsquo;Have the goodness to give him
      that, with my compliments, if you please. Good morning!&rsquo; Whereupon he
      handed Mark the scraps; retired, and shut the door.
    </p>
    <p>
      Mark thought it prudent to subdue his personal emotions, and return to
      Martin at the Dragon. They were not unprepared for such a reception, and
      suffered an hour or so to elapse before making another attempt. When this
      interval had gone by, they returned to Mr Pecksniff&rsquo;s house in company.
      Martin knocked this time, while Mr Tapley prepared himself to keep the
      door open with his foot and shoulder, when anybody came, and by that means
      secure an enforced parley. But this precaution was needless, for the
      servant-girl appeared almost immediately. Brushing quickly past her as he
      had resolved in such a case to do, Martin (closely followed by his
      faithful ally) opened the door of that parlour in which he knew a visitor
      was most likely to be found; passed at once into the room; and stood,
      without a word of notice or announcement, in the presence of his
      grandfather.
    </p>
    <p>
      Mr Pecksniff also was in the room; and Mary. In the swift instant of their
      mutual recognition, Martin saw the old man droop his grey head, and hide
      his face in his hands.
    </p>
    <p>
      It smote him to the heart. In his most selfish and most careless day, this
      lingering remnant of the old man&rsquo;s ancient love, this buttress of a ruined
      tower he had built up in the time gone by, with so much pride and hope,
      would have caused a pang in Martin&rsquo;s heart. But now, changed for the
      better in his worst respect; looking through an altered medium on his
      former friend, the guardian of his childhood, so broken and bowed down;
      resentment, sullenness, self-confidence, and pride, were all swept away,
      before the starting tears upon the withered cheeks. He could not bear to
      see them. He could not bear to think they fell at sight of him. He could
      not bear to view reflected in them, the reproachful and irrevocable Past.
    </p>
    <p>
      He hurriedly advanced to seize the old man&rsquo;s hand in his, when Mr
      Pecksniff interposed himself between them.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;No, young man!&rsquo; said Mr Pecksniff, striking himself upon the breast, and
      stretching out his other arm towards his guest as if it were a wing to
      shelter him. &lsquo;No, sir. None of that. Strike here, sir, here! Launch your
      arrows at me, sir, if you&rsquo;ll have the goodness; not at Him!&rsquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Grandfather!&rsquo; cried Martin. &lsquo;Hear me! I implore you, let me speak!&rsquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Would you, sir? Would you?&rsquo; said Mr Pecksniff, dodging about, so as to
      keep himself always between them. &lsquo;Is it not enough, sir, that you come
      into my house like a thief in the night, or I should rather say, for we
      can never be too particular on the subject of Truth, like a thief in the
      day-time; bringing your dissolute companions with you, to plant themselves
      with their backs against the insides of parlour doors, and prevent the
      entrance or issuing forth of any of my household&rsquo;&mdash;Mark had taken up
      this position, and held it quite unmoved&mdash;&lsquo;but would you also strike
      at venerable Virtue? Would you? Know that it is not defenceless. I will be
      its shield, young man. Assail me. Come on, sir. Fire away!&rsquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Pecksniff,&rsquo; said the old man, in a feeble voice. &lsquo;Calm yourself. Be
      quiet.&rsquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;I can&rsquo;t be calm,&rsquo; cried Mr Pecksniff, &lsquo;and I won&rsquo;t be quiet. My
      benefactor and my friend! Shall even my house be no refuge for your hoary
      pillow!&rsquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Stand aside!&rsquo; said the old man, stretching out his hand; &lsquo;and let me see
      what it is I used to love so dearly.&rsquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;It is right that you should see it, my friend,&rsquo; said Mr Pecksniff. &lsquo;It is
      well that you should see it, my noble sir. It is desirable that you should
      contemplate it in its true proportions. Behold it! There it is, sir. There
      it is!&rsquo;
    </p>

    </h5>
    <p>
      Martin could hardly be a mortal man, and not express in his face something
      of the anger and disdain with which Mr Pecksniff inspired him. But beyond
      this he evinced no knowledge whatever of that gentleman&rsquo;s presence or
      existence. True, he had once, and that at first, glanced at him
      involuntarily, and with supreme contempt; but for any other heed he took
      of him, there might have been nothing in his place save empty air.
    </p>
    <p>
      As Mr Pecksniff withdrew from between them, agreeably to the wish just now
      expressed (which he did during the delivery of the observations last
      recorded), old Martin, who had taken Mary Graham&rsquo;s hand in his, and
      whispered kindly to her, as telling her she had no cause to be alarmed,
      gently pushed her from him, behind his chair; and looked steadily at his
      grandson.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;And that,&rsquo; he said, &lsquo;is he. Ah! that is he! Say what you wish to say. But
      come no nearer,&rsquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;His sense of justice is so fine,&rsquo; said Mr Pecksniff, &lsquo;that he will hear
      even him, although he knows beforehand that nothing can come of it.
      Ingenuous mind!&rsquo; Mr Pecksniff did not address himself immediately to any
      person in saying this, but assuming the position of the Chorus in a Greek
      Tragedy, delivered his opinion as a commentary on the proceedings.
    </p>

    <p>
      &lsquo;Grandfather!&rsquo; said Martin, with great earnestness. &lsquo;From a painful
      journey, from a hard life, from a sick-bed, from privation and distress,
      from gloom and disappointment, from almost hopelessness and despair, I
      have come back to you.&rsquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Rovers of this sort,&rsquo; observed Mr Pecksniff, as Chorus, &lsquo;very commonly
      come back when they find they don&rsquo;t meet with the success they expected in
      their marauding ravages.&rsquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;But for this faithful man,&rsquo; said Martin, turning towards Mark, &lsquo;whom I
      first knew in this place, and who went away with me voluntarily, as a
      servant, but has been, throughout, my zealous and devoted friend; but for
      him, I must have died abroad. Far from home, far from any help or
      consolation; far from the probability even of my wretched fate being ever
      known to any one who cared to hear it&mdash;oh, that you would let me say,
      of being known to you!&rsquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      The old man looked at Mr Pecksniff. Mr Pecksniff looked at him. &lsquo;Did you
      speak, my worthy sir?&rsquo; said Mr Pecksniff, with a smile. The old man
      answered in the negative. &lsquo;I know what you thought,&rsquo; said Mr Pecksniff,
      with another smile. &lsquo;Let him go on my friend. The development of
      self-interest in the human mind is always a curious study. Let him go on,
      sir.&rsquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Go on!&rsquo; observed the old man; in a mechanical obedience, it appeared, to
      Mr Pecksniff&rsquo;s suggestion.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;I have been so wretched and so poor,&rsquo; said Martin, &lsquo;that I am indebted to
      the charitable help of a stranger, in a land of strangers, for the means
      of returning here. All this tells against me in your mind, I know. I have
      given you cause to think I have been driven here wholly by want, and have
      not been led on, in any degree, by affection or regret. When I parted from
      you, Grandfather, I deserved that suspicion, but I do not now. I do not
      now.&rsquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      The Chorus put its hand in its waistcoat, and smiled. &lsquo;Let him go on, my
      worthy sir,&rsquo; it said. &lsquo;I know what you are thinking of, but don&rsquo;t express
      it prematurely.&rsquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      Old Martin raised his eyes to Mr Pecksniff&rsquo;s face, and appearing to derive
      renewed instruction from his looks and words, said, once again:
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Go on!&rsquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;I have little more to say,&rsquo; returned Martin. &lsquo;And as I say it now, with
      little or no hope, Grandfather; whatever dawn of hope I had on entering
      the room; believe it to be true. At least, believe it to be true.&rsquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Beautiful Truth!&rsquo; exclaimed the Chorus, looking upward. &lsquo;How is your name
      profaned by vicious persons! You don&rsquo;t live in a well, my holy principle,
      but on the lips of false mankind. It is hard to bear with mankind, dear
      sir&rsquo;&mdash;addressing the elder Mr Chuzzlewit; &lsquo;but let us do so meekly.
      It is our duty so to do. Let us be among the Few who do their duty. If,&rsquo;
      pursued the Chorus, soaring up into a lofty flight, &lsquo;as the poet informs
      us, England expects Every man to do his duty, England is the most sanguine
      country on the face of the earth, and will find itself continually
      disappointed.&rsquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Upon that subject,&rsquo; said Martin, looking calmly at the old man as he
      spoke, but glancing once at Mary, whose face was now buried in her hands,
      upon the back of his easy-chair; &lsquo;upon that subject which first occasioned
      a division between us, my mind and heart are incapable of change. Whatever
      influence they have undergone, since that unhappy time, has not been one
      to weaken but to strengthen me. I cannot profess sorrow for that, nor
      irresolution in that, nor shame in that. Nor would you wish me, I know.
      But that I might have trusted to your love, if I had thrown myself
      manfully upon it; that I might have won you over with ease, if I had been
      more yielding and more considerate; that I should have best remembered
      myself in forgetting myself, and recollecting you; reflection, solitude,
      and misery, have taught me. I came resolved to say this, and to ask your
      forgiveness; not so much in hope for the future, as in regret for the
      past; for all that I would ask of you is, that you would aid me to live.
      Help me to get honest work to do, and I would do it. My condition places
      me at the disadvantage of seeming to have only my selfish ends to serve,
      but try if that be so or not. Try if I be self-willed, obdurate, and
      haughty, as I was; or have been disciplined in a rough school. Let the
      voice of nature and association plead between us, Grandfather; and do not,
      for one fault, however thankless, quite reject me!&rsquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      As he ceased, the grey head of the old man drooped again; and he concealed
      his face behind his outspread fingers.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;My dear sir,&rsquo; cried Mr Pecksniff, bending over him, &lsquo;you must not give
      way to this. It is very natural, and very amiable, but you must not allow
      the shameless conduct of one whom you long ago cast off, to move you so
      far. Rouse yourself. Think,&rsquo; said Pecksniff, &lsquo;think of Me, my friend.&rsquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;I will,&rsquo; returned old Martin, looking up into his face. &lsquo;You recall me to
      myself. I will.&rsquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Why, what,&rsquo; said Mr Pecksniff, sitting down beside him in a chair which
      he drew up for the purpose, and tapping him playfully on the arm, &lsquo;what is
      the matter with my strong-minded compatriot, if I may venture to take the
      liberty of calling him by that endearing expression? Shall I have to scold
      my coadjutor, or to reason with an intellect like this? I think not.&rsquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;No, no. There is no occasion,&rsquo; said the old man. &lsquo;A momentary feeling.
      Nothing more.&rsquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Indignation,&rsquo; observed Mr Pecksniff, &lsquo;<i>will </i>bring the scalding tear into
      the honest eye, I know&rsquo;&mdash;he wiped his own elaborately. &lsquo;But we have
      highest duties to perform than that. Rouse yourself, Mr Chuzzlewit. Shall
      I give expression to your thoughts, my friend?&rsquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Yes,&rsquo; said old Martin, leaning back in his chair, and looking at him,
      half in vacancy and half in admiration, as if he were fascinated by the
      man. &lsquo;Speak for me, Pecksniff, Thank you. You are true to me. Thank you!&rsquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Do not unman me, sir,&rsquo; said Mr Pecksniff, shaking his hand vigorously,
      &lsquo;or I shall be unequal to the task. It is not agreeable to my feelings, my
      good sir, to address the person who is now before us, for when I ejected
      him from this house, after hearing of his unnatural conduct from your
      lips, I renounced communication with him for ever. But you desire it; and
      that is sufficient. Young man! The door is immediately behind the
      companion of your infamy. Blush if you can; begone without a blush, if you
      can&rsquo;t.&rsquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      Martin looked as steadily at his grandfather as if there had been a dead
      silence all this time. The old man looked no less steadily at Mr
      Pecksniff.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;When I ordered you to leave this house upon the last occasion of your
      being dismissed from it with disgrace,&rsquo; said Mr Pecksniff; &lsquo;when, stung
      and stimulated beyond endurance by your shameless conduct to this
      extraordinarily noble-minded individual, I exclaimed &ldquo;Go forth!&rdquo; I told
      you that I wept for your depravity. Do not suppose that the tear which
      stands in my eye at this moment, is shed for you. It is shed for him, sir.
      It is shed for him.&rsquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      Here Mr Pecksniff, accidentally dropping the tear in question on a bald
      part of Mr Chuzzlewit&rsquo;s head, wiped the place with his
      pocket-handkerchief, and begged pardon.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;It is shed for him, sir, whom you seek to make the victim of your arts,&rsquo;
      said Mr Pecksniff; &lsquo;whom you seek to plunder, to deceive, and to mislead.
      It is shed in sympathy with him, and admiration of him; not in pity for
      him, for happily he knows what you are. You shall not wrong him further,
      sir, in any way,&rsquo; said Mr Pecksniff, quite transported with enthusiasm,
      &lsquo;while I have life. You may bestride my senseless corse, sir. That is very
      likely. I can imagine a mind like yours deriving great satisfaction from
      any measure of that kind. But while I continue to be called upon to exist,
      sir, you must strike at him through me. Awe!&rsquo; said Mr Pecksniff, shaking
      his head at Martin with indignant jocularity; &lsquo;and in such a cause you
      will find me, my young sir, an Ugly Customer!&rsquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      Still Martin looked steadily and mildly at his grandfather. &lsquo;Will you give
      me no answer,&rsquo; he said, at length, &lsquo;not a word?&rsquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;You hear what has been said,&rsquo; replied the old man, without averting his
      eyes from the face of Mr Pecksniff; who nodded encouragingly.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;I have not heard your voice. I have not heard your spirit,&rsquo; returned
      Martin.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Tell him again,&rsquo; said the old man, still gazing up in Mr Pecksniff&rsquo;s
      face.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;I only hear,&rsquo; replied Martin, strong in his purpose from the first, and
      stronger in it as he felt how Pecksniff winced and shrunk beneath his
      contempt; &lsquo;I only hear what you say to me, grandfather.&rsquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      Perhaps it was well for Mr Pecksniff that his venerable friend found in
      his (Mr Pecksniff&rsquo;s) features an exclusive and engrossing object of
      contemplation, for if his eyes had gone astray, and he had compared young
      Martin&rsquo;s bearing with that of his zealous defender, the latter
      disinterested gentleman would scarcely have shown to greater advantage
      than on the memorable afternoon when he took Tom Pinch&rsquo;s last receipt in
      full of all demands. One really might have thought there was some quality
      in Mr Pecksniff&mdash;an emanation from the brightness and purity within
      him perhaps&mdash;which set off and adorned his foes; they looked so
      gallant and so manly beside him.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Not a word?&rsquo; said Martin, for the second time.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;I remember that I have a word to say, Pecksniff,&rsquo; observed the old man.
      &lsquo;But a word. You spoke of being indebted to the charitable help of some
      stranger for the means of returning to England. Who is he? And what help
      in money did he render you?&rsquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      Although he asked this question of Martin, he did not look towards him,
      but kept his eyes on Mr Pecksniff as before. It appeared to have become a
      habit with him, both in a literal and figurative sense, to look to Mr
      Pecksniff alone.
    </p>
    <p>
      Martin took out his pencil, tore a leaf from his pocket-book, and hastily
      wrote down the particulars of his debt to Mr Bevan. The old man stretched
      out his hand for the paper, and took it; but his eyes did not wander from
      Mr Pecksniff&rsquo;s face.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;It would be a poor pride and a false humility,&rsquo; said Martin, in a low
      voice, &lsquo;to say, I do not wish that to be paid, or that I have any present
      hope of being able to pay it. But I never felt my poverty so deeply as I
      feel it now.&rsquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Read it to me, Pecksniff,&rsquo; said the old man.
    </p>
    <p>
      Mr Pecksniff, after approaching the perusal of the paper as if it were a
      manuscript confession of a murder, complied.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;I think, Pecksniff,&rsquo; said old Martin, &lsquo;I could wish that to be
      discharged. I should not like the lender, who was abroad, who had no
      opportunity of making inquiry, and who did (as he thought) a kind action,
      to suffer.&rsquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;An honourable sentiment, my dear sir. Your own entirely. But a dangerous
      precedent,&rsquo; said Mr Pecksniff, &lsquo;permit me to suggest.&rsquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;It shall not be a precedent,&rsquo; returned the old man. &lsquo;It is the only
      recognition of him. But we will talk of it again. You shall advise me.
      There is nothing else?&rsquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Nothing else,&rsquo; said Mr Pecksniff buoyantly, &lsquo;but for you to recover this
      intrusion&mdash;this cowardly and indefensible outrage on your feelings&mdash;with
      all possible dispatch, and smile again.&rsquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;You have nothing more to say?&rsquo; inquired the old man, laying his hand with
      unusual earnestness on Mr Pecksniff&rsquo;s sleeve.
    </p>
    <p>
      Mr Pecksniff would not say what rose to his lips. For reproaches he
      observed, were useless.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;You have nothing at all to urge? You are sure of that! If you have, no
      matter what it is, speak freely. I will oppose nothing that you ask of
      me,&rsquo; said the old man.
    </p>
    <p>
      The tears rose in such abundance to Mr Pecksniff&rsquo;s eyes at this proof of
      unlimited confidence on the part of his friend, that he was fain to clasp
      the bridge of his nose convulsively before he could at all compose
      himself. When he had the power of utterance again, he said with great
      emotion, that he hoped he should live to deserve this; and added, that he
      had no other observation whatever to make.
    </p>
    <p>
      For a few moments the old man sat looking at him, with that blank and
      motionless expression which is not uncommon in the faces of those whose
      faculties are on the wane, in age. But he rose up firmly too, and walked
      towards the door, from which Mark withdrew to make way for him.
    </p>
    <p>
      The obsequious Mr Pecksniff proffered his arm. The old man took it.
      Turning at the door, he said to Martin, waving him off with his hand,
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;You have heard him. Go away. It is all over. Go!&rsquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      Mr Pecksniff murmured certain cheering expressions of sympathy and
      encouragement as they retired; and Martin, awakening from the stupor into
      which the closing portion of this scene had plunged him, to the
      opportunity afforded by their departure, caught the innocent cause of all
      in his embrace, and pressed her to his heart.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Dear girl!&rsquo; said Martin. &lsquo;He has not changed you. Why, what an impotent
      and harmless knave the fellow is!&rsquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;You have restrained yourself so nobly! You have borne so much!&rsquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Restrained myself!&rsquo; cried Martin, cheerfully. &lsquo;You were by, and were
      unchanged, I knew. What more advantage did I want? The sight of me was
      such a bitterness to the dog, that I had my triumph in his being forced to
      endure it. But tell me, love&mdash;for the few hasty words we can exchange
      now are precious&mdash;what is this which has been rumoured to me? Is it
      true that you are persecuted by this knave&rsquo;s addresses?&rsquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;I was, dear Martin, and to some extent am now; but my chief source of
      unhappiness has been anxiety for you. Why did you leave us in such
      terrible suspense?&rsquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Sickness, distance; the dread of hinting at our real condition, the
      impossibility of concealing it except in perfect silence; the knowledge
      that the truth would have pained you infinitely more than uncertainty and
      doubt,&rsquo; said Martin, hurriedly; as indeed everything else was done and
      said, in those few hurried moments, &lsquo;were the causes of my writing only
      once. But Pecksniff? You needn&rsquo;t fear to tell me the whole tale; for you
      saw me with him face to face, hearing him speak, and not taking him by the
      throat; what is the history of his pursuit of you? Is it known to my
      grandfather?&rsquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Yes.&rsquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;And he assists him in it?&rsquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;No,&rsquo; she answered eagerly.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Thank Heaven!&rsquo; cried Martin, &lsquo;that it leaves his mind unclouded in that
      one respect!&rsquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;I do not think,&rsquo; said Mary, &lsquo;it was known to him at first. When this man
      had sufficiently prepared his mind, he revealed it to him by degrees. I
      think so, but I only know it from my own impression: now from anything
      they told me. Then he spoke to me alone.&rsquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;My grandfather did?&rsquo; said Martin.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Yes&mdash;spoke to me alone, and told me&mdash;&rsquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;What the hound had said,&rsquo; cried Martin. &lsquo;Don&rsquo;t repeat it.&rsquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;And said I knew well what qualities he possessed; that he was moderately
      rich; in good repute; and high in his favour and confidence. But seeing me
      very much distressed, he said that he would not control or force my
      inclinations, but would content himself with telling me the fact. He would
      not pain me by dwelling on it, or reverting to it; nor has he ever done so
      since, but has truly kept his word.&rsquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;The man himself?&mdash;&rsquo; asked Martin.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;He has had few opportunities of pursuing his suit. I have never walked
      out alone, or remained alone an instant in his presence. Dear Martin, I
      must tell you,&rsquo; she continued, &lsquo;that the kindness of your grandfather to
      me remains unchanged. I am his companion still. An indescribable
      tenderness and compassion seem to have mingled themselves with his old
      regard; and if I were his only child, I could not have a gentler father.
      What former fancy or old habit survives in this, when his heart has turned
      so cold to you, is a mystery I cannot penetrate; but it has been, and it
      is, a happiness to me, that I remained true to him; that if he should wake
      from his delusion, even at the point of death, I am here, love, to recall
      you to his thoughts.&rsquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      Martin looked with admiration on her glowing face, and pressed his lips to
      hers.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;I have sometimes heard, and read,&rsquo; she said, &lsquo;that those whose powers had
      been enfeebled long ago, and whose lives had faded, as it were, into a
      dream, have been known to rouse themselves before death, and inquire for
      familiar faces once very dear to them; but forgotten, unrecognized, hated
      even, in the meantime. Think, if with his old impressions of this man, he
      should suddenly resume his former self, and find in him his only friend!&rsquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;I would not urge you to abandon him, dearest,&rsquo; said Martin, &lsquo;though I
      could count the years we are to wear out asunder. But the influence this
      fellow exercises over him has steadily increased, I fear.&rsquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      She could not help admitting that. Steadily, imperceptibly, and surely,
      until it was paramount and supreme. She herself had none; and yet he
      treated her with more affection than at any previous time. Martin thought
      the inconsistency a part of his weakness and decay.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Does the influence extend to fear?&rsquo; said Martin. &lsquo;Is he timid of
      asserting his own opinion in the presence of this infatuation? I fancied
      so just now.&rsquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;I have thought so, often. Often when we are sitting alone, almost as we
      used to do, and I have been reading a favourite book to him or he has been
      talking quite cheerfully, I have observed that the entrance of Mr
      Pecksniff has changed his whole demeanour. He has broken off immediately,
      and become what you have seen to-day. When we first came here he had his
      impetuous outbreaks, in which it was not easy for Mr Pecksniff with his
      utmost plausibility to appease him. But these have long since dwindled
      away. He defers to him in everything, and has no opinion upon any
      question, but that which is forced upon him by this treacherous man.&rsquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      Such was the account, rapidly furnished in whispers, and interrupted,
      brief as it was, by many false alarms of Mr Pecksniff&rsquo;s return; which
      Martin received of his grandfather&rsquo;s decline, and of that good gentleman&rsquo;s
      ascendancy. He heard of Tom Pinch too, and Jonas too, with not a little
      about himself into the bargain; for though lovers are remarkable for
      leaving a great deal unsaid on all occasions, and very properly desiring
      to come back and say it, they are remarkable also for a wonderful power of
      condensation, and can, in one way or other, give utterance to more
      language&mdash;eloquent language&mdash;in any given short space of time,
      than all the six hundred and fifty-eight members in the Commons House of
      Parliament of the United Kingdom of Great Britain and Ireland; who are
      strong lovers no doubt, but of their country only, which makes all the
      difference; for in a passion of that kind (which is not always returned),
      it is the custom to use as many words as possible, and express nothing
      whatever.
    </p>
    <p>
      A caution from Mr Tapley; a hasty interchange of farewells, and of
      something else which the proverb says must not be told of afterwards; a
      white hand held out to Mr Tapley himself, which he kissed with the
      devotion of a knight-errant; more farewells, more something else&rsquo;s; a
      parting word from Martin that he would write from London and would do
      great things there yet (Heaven knows what, but he quite believed it); and
      Mark and he stood on the outside of the Pecksniffian halls.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;A short interview after such an absence!&rsquo; said Martin, sorrowfully. &lsquo;But
      we are well out of the house. We might have placed ourselves in a false
      position by remaining there, even so long, Mark.&rsquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;I don&rsquo;t know about ourselves, sir,&rsquo; he returned; &lsquo;but somebody else would
      have got into a false position, if he had happened to come back again,
      while we was there. I had the door all ready, sir. If Pecksniff had showed
      his head, or had only so much as listened behind it, I would have caught
      him like a walnut. He&rsquo;s the sort of man,&rsquo; added Mr Tapley, musing, &lsquo;as
      would squeeze soft, I know.&rsquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      A person who was evidently going to Mr Pecksniff&rsquo;s house, passed them at
      this moment. He raised his eyes at the mention of the architect&rsquo;s name;
      and when he had gone on a few yards, stopped and gazed at them. Mr Tapley,
      also, looked over his shoulder, and so did Martin; for the stranger, as he
      passed, had looked very sharply at them.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Who may that be, I wonder!&rsquo; said Martin. &lsquo;The face seems familiar to me,
      but I don&rsquo;t know the man.&rsquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;He seems to have a amiable desire that his face should be tolerable
      familiar to us,&rsquo; said Mr Tapley, &lsquo;for he&rsquo;s a-staring pretty hard. He&rsquo;d
      better not waste his beauty, for he ain&rsquo;t got much to spare.&rsquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      Coming in sight of the Dragon, they saw a travelling carriage at the door.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;And a Salisbury carriage, eh?&rsquo; said Mr Tapley. &lsquo;That&rsquo;s what he came in
      depend upon it. What&rsquo;s in the wind now? A new pupil, I shouldn&rsquo;t wonder.
      P&rsquo;raps it&rsquo;s a order for another grammar-school, of the same pattern as the
      last.&rsquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      Before they could enter at the door, Mrs Lupin came running out; and
      beckoning them to the carriage showed them a portmanteau with the name of
      <i>Chuzzlewit </i>upon it.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Miss Pecksniff&rsquo;s husband that was,&rsquo; said the good woman to Martin. &lsquo;I
      didn&rsquo;t know what terms you might be on, and was quite in a worry till you
      came back.&rsquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;He and I have never interchanged a word yet,&rsquo; observed Martin; &lsquo;and as I
      have no wish to be better or worse acquainted with him, I will not put
      myself in his way. We passed him on the road, I have no doubt. I am glad
      he timed his coming as he did. Upon my word! Miss Pecksniff&rsquo;s husband
      travels gayly!&rsquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;A very fine-looking gentleman with him&mdash;in the best room now,&rsquo;
      whispered Mrs Lupin, glancing up at the window as they went into the
      house. &lsquo;He has ordered everything that can be got for dinner; and has the
      glossiest moustaches and whiskers ever you saw.&rsquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Has he?&rsquo; cried Martin, &lsquo;why then we&rsquo;ll endeavour to avoid him too, in the
      hope that our self-denial may be strong enough for the sacrifice. It is
      only for a few hours,&rsquo; said Martin, dropping wearily into a chair behind
      the little screen in the bar. &lsquo;Our visit has met with no success, my dear
      Mrs Lupin, and I must go to London.&rsquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Dear, dear!&rsquo; cried the hostess.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Yes, one foul wind no more makes a winter, than one swallow makes a
      summer. I&rsquo;ll try it again. Tom Pinch has succeeded. With his advice to
      guide me, I may do the same. I took Tom under my protection once, God save
      the mark!&rsquo; said Martin, with a melancholy smile; &lsquo;and promised I would
      make his fortune. Perhaps Tom will take me under <i>his </i>protection now, and
      teach me how to earn my bread.&rsquo;

      CHAPTER FORTY-FOUR
    </h2>
    <h3>
      FURTHER CONTINUATION OF THE ENTERPRISE OF MR JONAS AND HIS FRIEND
    </h3>
    <p>
      It was a special quality, among the many admirable qualities possessed by
      Mr Pecksniff, that the more he was found out, the more hypocrisy he
      practised. Let him be discomfited in one quarter, and he refreshed and
      recompensed himself by carrying the war into another. If his workings and
      windings were detected by A, so much the greater reason was there for
      practicing without loss of time on B, if it were only to keep his hand in.
      He had never been such a saintly and improving spectacle to all about him,
      as after his detection by Thomas Pinch. He had scarcely ever been at once
      so tender in his humanity, and so dignified and exalted in his virtue, as
      when young Martin&rsquo;s scorn was fresh and hot upon him.
    </p>
    <p>
      Having this large stock of superfluous sentiment and morality on hand
      which must positively be cleared off at any sacrifice, Mr Pecksniff no
      sooner heard his son-in-law announced, than he regarded him as a kind of
      wholesale or general order, to be immediately executed. Descending,
      therefore, swiftly to the parlour, and clasping the young man in his arms,
      he exclaimed, with looks and gestures that denoted the perturbation of his
      spirit:
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Jonas. My child&mdash;she is well! There is nothing the matter?&rsquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;What, you&rsquo;re at it again, are you?&rsquo; replied his son-in-law. &lsquo;Even with
      me? Get away with you, will you?&rsquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Tell me she is well then,&rsquo; said Mr Pecksniff. &lsquo;Tell me she is well my
      boy!&rsquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;She&rsquo;s well enough,&rsquo; retorted Jonas, disengaging himself. &lsquo;There&rsquo;s nothing
      the matter with <i>her</i>.&rsquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;There is nothing the matter with her!&rsquo; cried Mr Pecksniff, sitting down
      in the nearest chair, and rubbing up his hair. &lsquo;Fie upon my weakness! I
      cannot help it, Jonas. Thank you. I am better now. How is my other child;
      my eldest; my Cherrywerrychigo?&rsquo; said Mr Pecksniff, inventing a playful
      little name for her, in the restored lightness of his heart.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;She&rsquo;s much about the same as usual,&rsquo; returned Jonas. &lsquo;She sticks pretty
      close to the vinegar-bottle. You know she&rsquo;s got a sweetheart, I suppose?&rsquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;I have heard of it,&rsquo; said Mr Pecksniff, &lsquo;from headquarters; from my child
      herself I will not deny that it moved me to contemplate the loss of my
      remaining daughter, Jonas&mdash;I am afraid we parents are selfish, I am
      afraid we are&mdash;but it has ever been the study of my life to qualify
      them for the domestic hearth; and it is a sphere which Cherry will adorn.&rsquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;She need adorn some sphere or other,&rsquo; observed the son-in-law, for she
      ain&rsquo;t very ornamental in general.&rsquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;My girls are now provided for,&rsquo; said Mr Pecksniff. &lsquo;They are now happily
      provided for, and I have not laboured in vain!&rsquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      This is exactly what Mr Pecksniff would have said, if one of his daughters
      had drawn a prize of thirty thousand pounds in the lottery, or if the
      other had picked up a valuable purse in the street, which nobody appeared
      to claim. In either of these cases he would have invoked a patriarchal
      blessing on the fortunate head, with great solemnity, and would have taken
      immense credit to himself, as having meant it from the infant&rsquo;s cradle.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Suppose we talk about something else, now,&rsquo; observed Jonas, drily. &lsquo;just
      for a change. Are you quite agreeable?&rsquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Quite,&rsquo; said Mr Pecksniff. &lsquo;Ah, you wag, you naughty wag! You laugh at
      poor old fond papa. Well! He deserves it. And he don&rsquo;t mind it either, for
      his feelings are their own reward. You have come to stay with me, Jonas?&rsquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;No. I&rsquo;ve got a friend with me,&rsquo; said Jonas.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Bring your friend!&rsquo; cried Mr Pecksniff, in a gush of hospitality. &lsquo;Bring
      any number of your friends!&rsquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;This ain&rsquo;t the sort of man to be brought,&rsquo; said Jonas, contemptuously. &lsquo;I
      think I see myself &ldquo;bringing&rdquo; him to your house, for a treat! Thank&rsquo;ee all
      the same; but he&rsquo;s a little too near the top of the tree for that,
      Pecksniff.&rsquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      The good man pricked up his ears; his interest was awakened. A position
      near the top of the tree was greatness, virtue, goodness, sense, genius;
      or, it should rather be said, a dispensation from all, and in itself
      something immeasurably better than all; with Mr Pecksniff. A man who was
      able to look down upon Mr Pecksniff could not be looked up at, by that
      gentleman, with too great an amount of deference, or from a position of
      too much humility. So it always is with great spirits.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;I&rsquo;ll tell you what you may do, if you like,&rsquo; said Jonas; &lsquo;you may come
      and dine with us at the Dragon. We were forced to come down to Salisbury
      last night, on some business, and I got him to bring me over here this
      morning, in his carriage; at least, not his own carriage, for we had a
      breakdown in the night, but one we hired instead; it&rsquo;s all the same. Mind
      what you&rsquo;re about, you know. He&rsquo;s not used to all sorts; he only mixes
      with the best!&rsquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Some young nobleman who has been borrowing money of you at good interest,
      eh?&rsquo; said Mr Pecksniff, shaking his forefinger facetiously. &lsquo;I shall be
      delighted to know the gay sprig.&rsquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Borrowing!&rsquo; echoed Jonas. &lsquo;Borrowing! When you&rsquo;re a twentieth part as
      rich as he is, you may shut up shop! We should be pretty well off if we
      could buy his furniture, and plate, and pictures, by clubbing together. A
      likely man to borrow: Mr Montague! Why since I was lucky enough (come! and
      I&rsquo;ll say, sharp enough, too) to get a share in the Assurance office that
      he&rsquo;s President of, I&rsquo;ve made&mdash;never mind what I&rsquo;ve made,&rsquo; said Jonas,
      seeming to recover all at once his usual caution. &lsquo;You know me pretty
      well, and I don&rsquo;t blab about such things. But, Ecod, I&rsquo;ve made a trifle.&rsquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Really, my dear Jonas,&rsquo; cried Mr Pecksniff, with much warmth, &lsquo;a
      gentleman like this should receive some attention. Would he like to see
      the church? or if he has a taste for the fine arts&mdash;which I have no
      doubt he has, from the description you give of his circumstances&mdash;I
      can send him down a few portfolios. Salisbury Cathedral, my dear Jonas,&rsquo;
      said Mr Pecksniff; the mention of the portfolios and his anxiety to
      display himself to advantage, suggesting his usual phraseology in that
      regard, &lsquo;is an edifice replete with venerable associations, and strikingly
      suggestive of the loftiest emotions. It is here we contemplate the work of
      bygone ages. It is here we listen to the swelling organ, as we stroll
      through the reverberating aisles. We have drawings of this celebrated
      structure from the North, from the South, from the East, from the West,
      from the South-East, from the Nor&rsquo;West&mdash;&rsquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      During this digression, and indeed during the whole dialogue, Jonas had
      been rocking on his chair, with his hands in his pockets and his head
      thrown cunningly on one side. He looked at Mr Pecksniff now with such
      shrewd meaning twinkling in his eyes, that Mr Pecksniff stopped, and asked
      him what he was going to say.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Ecod!&rsquo; he answered. &lsquo;Pecksniff if I knew how you meant to leave your
      money, I could put you in the way of doubling it in no time. It wouldn&rsquo;t
      be bad to keep a chance like this snug in the family. But you&rsquo;re such a
      deep one!&rsquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Jonas!&rsquo; cried Mr Pecksniff, much affected, &lsquo;I am not a diplomatical
      character; my heart is in my hand. By far the greater part of the
      inconsiderable savings I have accumulated in the course of&mdash;I hope&mdash;a
      not dishonourable or useless career, is already given, devised, and
      bequeathed (correct me, my dear Jonas, if I am technically wrong), with
      expressions of confidence, which I will not repeat; and in securities
      which it is unnecessary to mention to a person whom I cannot, whom I will
      not, whom I need not, name.&rsquo; Here he gave the hand of his son-in-law a
      fervent squeeze, as if he would have added, &lsquo;God bless you; be very
      careful of it when you get it!&rsquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      Mr Jonas only shook his head and laughed, and, seeming to think better of
      what he had had in his mind, said, &lsquo;No. He would keep his own counsel.&rsquo;
      But as he observed that he would take a walk, Mr Pecksniff insisted on
      accompanying him, remarking that he could leave a card for Mr Montague, as
      they went along, by way of gentleman-usher to himself at dinner-time.
      Which he did.
    </p>
    <p>
      In the course of their walk, Mr Jonas affected to maintain that close
      reserve which had operated as a timely check upon him during the foregoing
      dialogue. And as he made no attempt to conciliate Mr Pecksniff, but, on
      the contrary, was more boorish and rude to him than usual, that gentleman,
      so far from suspecting his real design, laid himself out to be attacked
      with advantage. For it is in the nature of a knave to think the tools with
      which he works indispensable to knavery; and knowing what he would do
      himself in such a case, Mr Pecksniff argued, &lsquo;if this young man wanted
      anything of me for his own ends, he would be polite and deferential.&rsquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      The more Jonas repelled him in his hints and inquiries, the more
      solicitous, therefore, Mr Pecksniff became to be initiated into the golden
      mysteries at which he had obscurely glanced. Why should there be cold and
      worldly secrets, he observed, between relations? What was life without
      confidence? If the chosen husband of his daughter, the man to whom he had
      delivered her with so much pride and hope, such bounding and such beaming
      joy; if he were not a green spot in the barren waste of life, where was
      that oasis to be bound?
    </p>
    <p>
      Little did Mr Pecksniff think on what a very green spot he planted one
      foot at that moment! Little did he foresee when he said, &lsquo;All is but
      dust!&rsquo; how very shortly he would come down with his own!
    </p>
    <p>
      Inch by inch, in his grudging and ill-conditioned way; sustained to the
      life, for the hope of making Mr Pecksniff suffer in that tender place, the
      pocket, where Jonas smarted so terribly himself, gave him an additional
      and malicious interest in the wiles he was set on to practise; inch by
      inch, and bit by bit, Jonas rather allowed the dazzling prospects of the
      Anglo-Bengalee establishment to escape him, than paraded them before his
      greedy listener. And in the same niggardly spirit, he left Mr Pecksniff to
      infer, if he chose (which he <i>did </i>choose, of course), that a consciousness
      of not having any great natural gifts of speech and manner himself,
      rendered him desirous to have the credit of introducing to Mr Montague
      some one who was well endowed in those respects, and so atone for his own
      deficiencies. Otherwise, he muttered discontentedly, he would have seen
      his beloved father-in-law &lsquo;far enough off,&rsquo; before he would have taken him
      into his confidence.
    </p>
    <p>
      Primed in this artful manner, Mr Pecksniff presented himself at
      dinner-time in such a state of suavity, benevolence, cheerfulness,
      politeness, and cordiality, as even he had perhaps never attained before.
      The frankness of the country gentleman, the refinement of the artist, the
      good-humoured allowance of the man of the world; philanthropy,
      forbearance, piety, toleration, all blended together in a flexible
      adaptability to anything and everything; were expressed in Mr Pecksniff,
      as he shook hands with the great speculator and capitalist.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Welcome, respected sir,&rsquo; said Mr Pecksniff, &lsquo;to our humble village! We
      are a simple people; primitive clods, Mr Montague; but we can appreciate
      the honour of your visit, as my dear son-in-law can testify. It is very
      strange,&rsquo; said Mr Pecksniff, pressing his hand almost reverentially, &lsquo;but
      I seem to know you. That towering forehead, my dear Jonas,&rsquo; said Mr
      Pecksniff aside, &lsquo;and those clustering masses of rich hair&mdash;I must
      have seen you, my dear sir, in the sparkling throng.&rsquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      Nothing was more probable, they all agreed.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;I could have wished,&rsquo; said Mr Pecksniff, &lsquo;to have had the honour of
      introducing you to an elderly inmate of our house: to the uncle of our
      friend. Mr Chuzzlewit, sir, would have been proud indeed to have taken you
      by the hand.&rsquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Is the gentleman here now?&rsquo; asked Montague, turning deeply red. &lsquo;He is,&rsquo;
      said Mr Pecksniff.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;You said nothing about that, Chuzzlewit.&rsquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;I didn&rsquo;t suppose you&rsquo;d care to hear of it,&rsquo; returned Jonas. &lsquo;You wouldn&rsquo;t
      care to know him, I can promise you.&rsquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Jonas! my dear Jonas!&rsquo; remonstrated Mr Pecksniff. &lsquo;Really!&rsquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Oh! it&rsquo;s all very well for you to speak up for him,&rsquo; said Jonas. &lsquo;You
      have nailed him. You&rsquo;ll get a fortune by him.&rsquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Oho! Is the wind in that quarter?&rsquo; cried Montague. &lsquo;Ha, ha, ha!&rsquo; and here
      they all laughed&mdash;especially Mr Pecksniff.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;No, no!&rsquo; said that gentleman, clapping his son-in-law playfully upon the
      shoulder. &lsquo;You must not believe all that my young relative says, Mr
      Montague. You may believe him in official business, and trust him in
      official business, but you must not attach importance to his flights of
      fancy.&rsquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Upon my life, Mr Pecksniff,&rsquo; cried Montague, &lsquo;I attach the greatest
      importance to that last observation of his. I trust and hope it&rsquo;s true.
      Money cannot be turned and turned again quickly enough in the ordinary
      course, Mr Pecksniff. There is nothing like building our fortune on the
      weaknesses of mankind.&rsquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Oh fie! oh fie, for shame!&rsquo; cried Mr Pecksniff. But they all laughed
      again&mdash;especially Mr Pecksniff.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;I give you my honour that <i>we</i> do it,&rsquo; said Montague.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Oh fie, fie!&rsquo; cried Mr Pecksniff. &lsquo;You are very pleasant. That I am sure
      you don&rsquo;t! That I am sure you don&rsquo;t! How <i>can </i>you, you know?&rsquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      Again they all laughed in concert; and again Mr Pecksniff laughed
      especially.
    </p>
    <p>
      This was very agreeable indeed. It was confidential, easy,
      straight-forward; and still left Mr Pecksniff in the position of being in
      a gentle way the Mentor of the party. The greatest achievements in the
      article of cookery that the Dragon had ever performed, were set before
      them; the oldest and best wines in the Dragon&rsquo;s cellar saw the light on
      that occasion; a thousand bubbles, indicative of the wealth and station of
      Mr Montague in the depths of his pursuits, were constantly rising to the
      surface of the conversation; and they were as frank and merry as three
      honest men could be. Mr Pecksniff thought it a pity (he said so) that Mr
      Montague should think lightly of mankind and their weaknesses. He was
      anxious upon this subject; his mind ran upon it; in one way or another he
      was constantly coming back to it; he must make a convert of him, he said.
      And as often as Mr Montague repeated his sentiment about building fortunes
      on the weaknesses of mankind, and added frankly, &lsquo;<i>we</i> do it!&rsquo; just as often
      Mr Pecksniff repeated &lsquo;Oh fie! oh fie, for shame! I am sure you don&rsquo;t. How
      <i>can </i>you, you know?&rsquo; laying a greater stress each time on those last words.
    </p>
    <p>
      The frequent repetition of this playful inquiry on the part of Mr
      Pecksniff, led at last to playful answers on the part of Mr Montague; but
      after some little sharp-shooting on both sides, Mr Pecksniff became grave,
      almost to tears; observing that if Mr Montague would give him leave, he
      would drink the health of his young kinsman, Mr Jonas; congratulating him
      upon the valuable and distinguished friendship he had formed, but envying
      him, he would confess, his usefulness to his fellow-creatures. For, if he
      understood the objects of that Institution with which he was newly and
      advantageously connected&mdash;knowing them but imperfectly&mdash;they
      were calculated to do Good; and for his (Mr Pecksniff&rsquo;s) part, if he could
      in any way promote them, he thought he would be able to lay his head upon
      his pillow every night, with an absolute certainty of going to sleep at
      once.
    </p>
    <p>
      The transition from this accidental remark (for it was quite accidental
      and had fallen from Mr Pecksniff in the openness of his soul), to the
      discussion of the subject as a matter of business, was easy. Books,
      papers, statements, tables, calculations of various kinds, were soon
      spread out before them; and as they were all framed with one object, it is
      not surprising that they should all have tended to one end. But still,
      whenever Montague enlarged upon the profits of the office, and said that
      as long as there were gulls upon the wing it must succeed, Mr Pecksniff
      mildly said &lsquo;Oh fie!&rsquo;&mdash;and might indeed have remonstrated with him,
      but that he knew he was joking. Mr Pecksniff did know he was joking;
      because he said so.
    </p>
    <p>
      There never had been before, and there never would be again, such an
      opportunity for the investment of a considerable sum (the rate of
      advantage increased in proportion to the amount invested), as at that
      moment. The only time that had at all approached it, was the time when
      Jonas had come into the concern; which made him ill-natured now, and
      inclined him to pick out a doubt in this place, and a flaw in that, and
      grumbling to advise Mr Pecksniff to think better of it. The sum which
      would complete the proprietorship in this snug concern, was nearly equal
      to Mr Pecksniff&rsquo;s whole hoard; not counting Mr Chuzzlewit, that is to say,
      whom he looked upon as money in the Bank, the possession of which inclined
      him the more to make a dash with his own private sprats for the capture of
      such a whale as Mr Montague described. The returns began almost
      immediately, and were immense. The end of it was, that Mr Pecksniff agreed
      to become the last partner and proprietor in the Anglo-Bengalee, and made
      an appointment to dine with Mr Montague, at Salisbury, on the next day but
      one, then and there to complete the negotiation.
    </p>
    <p>
      It took so long to bring the subject to this head, that it was nearly
      midnight when they parted. When Mr Pecksniff walked downstairs to the
      door, he found Mrs Lupin standing there, looking out.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Ah, my good friend!&rsquo; he said; &lsquo;not a-bed yet! Contemplating the stars,
      Mrs Lupin?&rsquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;It&rsquo;s a beautiful starlight night, sir.&rsquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;A beautiful starlight night,&rsquo; said Mr Pecksniff, looking up. &lsquo;Behold the
      planets, how they shine! Behold the&mdash;those two persons who were here
      this morning have left your house, I hope, Mrs Lupin?&rsquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Yes, sir. They are gone.&rsquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;I am glad to hear it,&rsquo; said Mr Pecksniff. &lsquo;Behold the wonders of the
      firmament, Mrs Lupin! how glorious is the scene! When I look up at those
      shining orbs, I think that each of them is winking to the other to take
      notice of the vanity of men&rsquo;s pursuits. My fellow-men!&rsquo; cried Mr
      Pecksniff, shaking his head in pity; &lsquo;you are much mistaken; my wormy
      relatives, you are much deceived! The stars are perfectly contented (I
      suppose so) in their several spheres. Why are not you? Oh! do not strive
      and struggle to enrich yourselves, or to get the better of each other, my
      deluded friends, but look up there, with me!&rsquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      Mrs Lupin shook her head, and heaved a sigh. It was very affecting.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Look up there, with me!&rsquo; repeated Mr Pecksniff, stretching out his hand;
      &lsquo;With me, a humble individual who is also an insect like yourselves. Can
      silver, gold, or precious stones, sparkle like those constellations! I
      think not. Then do not thirst for silver, gold, or precious stones; but
      look up there, with me!&rsquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      With those words, the good man patted Mrs Lupin&rsquo;s hand between his own, as
      if he would have added &lsquo;think of this, my good woman!&rsquo; and walked away in
      a sort of ecstasy or rapture, with his hat under his arm.
    </p>
    <p>
      Jonas sat in the attitude in which Mr Pecksniff had left him, gazing
      moodily at his friend; who, surrounded by a heap of documents, was writing
      something on an oblong slip of paper.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;You mean to wait at Salisbury over the day after to-morrow, do you,
      then?&rsquo; said Jonas.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;You heard our appointment,&rsquo; returned Montague, without raising his eyes.
      &lsquo;In any case I should have waited to see after the boy.&rsquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      They appeared to have changed places again; Montague being in high
      spirits; Jonas gloomy and lowering.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;You don&rsquo;t want me, I suppose?&rsquo; said Jonas.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;I want you to put your name here,&rsquo; he returned, glancing at him with a
      smile, &lsquo;as soon as I have filled up the stamp. I may as well have your
      note of hand for that extra capital. That&rsquo;s all I want. If you wish to go
      home, I can manage Mr Pecksniff now, alone. There is a perfect
      understanding between us.&rsquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      Jonas sat scowling at him as he wrote, in silence. When he had finished
      his writing, and had dried it on the blotting paper in his
      travelling-desk; he looked up, and tossed the pen towards him.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;What, not a day&rsquo;s grace, not a day&rsquo;s trust, eh?&rsquo; said Jonas bitterly.
      &lsquo;Not after the pains I have taken with to-night&rsquo;s work?&rsquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;To night&rsquo;s work was a part of our bargain,&rsquo; replied Montague; &lsquo;and so was
      this.&rsquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;You drive a hard bargain,&rsquo; said Jonas, advancing to the table. &lsquo;You know
      best. Give it here!&rsquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      Montague gave him the paper. After pausing as if he could not make up his
      mind to put his name to it, Jonas dipped his pen hastily in the nearest
      inkstand, and began to write. But he had scarcely marked the paper when he
      started back, in a panic.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Why, what the devil&rsquo;s this?&rsquo; he said. &lsquo;It&rsquo;s bloody!&rsquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      He had dipped the pen, as another moment showed, into red ink. But he
      attached a strange degree of importance to the mistake. He asked how it
      had come there, who had brought it, why it had been brought; and looked at
      Montague, at first, as if he thought he had put a trick upon him. Even
      when he used a different pen, and the right ink, he made some scratches on
      another paper first, as half believing they would turn red also.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Black enough, this time,&rsquo; he said, handing the note to Montague.
      &lsquo;Good-bye.&rsquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Going now! how do you mean to get away from here?&rsquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;I shall cross early in the morning to the high road, before you are out
      of bed; and catch the day-coach, going up. Good-bye!&rsquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;You are in a hurry!&rsquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;I have something to do,&rsquo; said Jonas. &lsquo;Good-bye!&rsquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      His friend looked after him as he went out, in surprise, which gradually
      gave place to an air of satisfaction and relief.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;It happens all the better. It brings about what I wanted, without any
      difficulty. I shall travel home alone.&rsquo;

      CHAPTER FORTY-FIVE
    </h2>
    <p>
      IN WHICH TOM PINCH AND HIS SISTER TAKE A LITTLE PLEASURE; BUT QUITE IN A
      DOMESTIC WAY, AND WITH NO CEREMONY ABOUT IT
    </p>
    <p>
      Tom Pinch and his sister having to part, for the dispatch of the morning&rsquo;s
      business, immediately after the dispersion of the other actors in the
      scene upon the wharf with which the reader has been already made
      acquainted, had no opportunity of discussing the subject at that time. But
      Tom, in his solitary office, and Ruth, in the triangular parlour, thought
      about nothing else all day; and, when their hour of meeting in the
      afternoon approached, they were very full of it, to be sure.
    </p>
    <p>
      There was a little plot between them, that Tom should always come out of
      the Temple by one way; and that was past the fountain. Coming through
      Fountain Court, he was just to glance down the steps leading into Garden
      Court, and to look once all round him; and if Ruth had come to meet him,
      there he would see her; not sauntering, you understand (on account of the
      clerks), but coming briskly up, with the best little laugh upon her face
      that ever played in opposition to the fountain, and beat it all to
      nothing. For, fifty to one, Tom had been looking for her in the wrong
      direction, and had quite given her up, while she had been tripping towards
      him from the first; jingling that little reticule of hers (with all the
      keys in it) to attract his wandering observation.
    </p>
    <p>
      Whether there was life enough left in the slow vegetation of Fountain
      Court for the smoky shrubs to have any consciousness of the brightest and
      purest-hearted little woman in the world, is a question for gardeners, and
      those who are learned in the loves of plants. But, that it was a good
      thing for that same paved yard to have such a delicate little figure
      flitting through it; that it passed like a smile from the grimy old
      houses, and the worn flagstones, and left them duller, darker, sterner
      than before; there is no sort of doubt. The Temple fountain might have
      leaped up twenty feet to greet the spring of hopeful maidenhood, that in
      her person stole on, sparkling, through the dry and dusty channels of the
      Law; the chirping sparrows, bred in Temple chinks and crannies, might have
      held their peace to listen to imaginary skylarks, as so fresh a little
      creature passed; the dingy boughs, unused to droop, otherwise than in
      their puny growth, might have bent down in a kindred gracefulness to shed
      their benedictions on her graceful head; old love letters, shut up in iron
      boxes in the neighbouring offices, and made of no account among the heaps
      of family papers into which they had strayed, and of which, in their
      degeneracy, they formed a part, might have stirred and fluttered with a
      moment&rsquo;s recollection of their ancient tenderness, as she went lightly by.
      Anything might have happened that did not happen, and never will, for the
      love of Ruth.
    </p>
    <p>
      Something happened, too, upon the afternoon of which the history treats.
      Not for her love. Oh no! quite by accident, and without the least
      reference to her at all.
    </p>
    <p>
      Either she was a little too soon, or Tom was a little too late&mdash;she
      was so precise in general, that she timed it to half a minute&mdash;but no
      Tom was there. Well! But was anybody else there, that she blushed so
      deeply, after looking round, and tripped off down the steps with such
      unusual expedition?
    </p>
    <p>
      Why, the fact is, that Mr Westlock was passing at that moment. The Temple
      is a public thoroughfare; they may write up on the gates that it is not,
      but so long as the gates are left open it is, and will be; and Mr Westlock
      had as good a right to be there as anybody else. But why did she run away,
      then? Not being ill dressed, for she was much too neat for that, why did
      she run away? The brown hair that had fallen down beneath her bonnet, and
      had one impertinent imp of a false flower clinging to it, boastful of its
      licence before all men, <i>that </i>could not have been the cause, for it looked
      charming. Oh! foolish, panting, frightened little heart, why did she run
      away!
    </p>
    <p>
      Merrily the tiny fountain played, and merrily the dimples sparkled on its
      sunny face. John Westlock hurried after her. Softly the whispering water
      broke and fell; as roguishly the dimples twinkled, as he stole upon her
      footsteps.
    </p>
    <p>
      Oh, foolish, panting, timid little heart, why did she feign to be
      unconscious of his coming! Why wish herself so far away, yet be so
      flutteringly happy there!
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;I felt sure it was you,&rsquo; said John, when he overtook her in the sanctuary
      of Garden Court. &lsquo;I knew I couldn&rsquo;t be mistaken.&rsquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      She was <i>so</i> surprised.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;You are waiting for your brother,&rsquo; said John. &lsquo;Let me bear you company.&rsquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      So light was the touch of the coy little hand, that he glanced down to
      assure himself he had it on his arm. But his glance, stopping for an
      instant at the bright eyes, forgot its first design, and went no farther.
    </p>
    <p>
      They walked up and down three or four times, speaking about Tom and his
      mysterious employment. Now that was a very natural and innocent subject,
      surely. Then why, whenever Ruth lifted up her eyes, did she let them fall
      again immediately, and seek the uncongenial pavement of the court? They
      were not such eyes as shun the light; they were not such eyes as require
      to be hoarded to enhance their value. They were much too precious and too
      genuine to stand in need of arts like those. Somebody must have been
      looking at them!
    </p>
    <p>
      They found out Tom, though, quickly enough. This pair of eyes descried him
      in the distance, the moment he appeared. He was staring about him, as
      usual, in all directions but the right one; and was as obstinate in not
      looking towards them, as if he had intended it. As it was plain that,
      being left to himself, he would walk away home, John Westlock darted off
      to stop him.
    </p>
    <p>
      This made the approach of poor little Ruth, by herself, one of the most
      embarrassing of circumstances. There was Tom, manifesting extreme surprise
      (he had no presence of mind, that Tom, on small occasions); there was
      John, making as light of it as he could, but explaining at the same time
      with most unnecessary elaboration; and here was she, coming towards them,
      with both of them looking at her, conscious of blushing to a terrible
      extent, but trying to throw up her eyebrows carelessly, and pout her rosy
      lips, as if she were the coolest and most unconcerned of little women.
    </p>
    <p>
      Merrily the fountain plashed and plashed, until the dimples, merging into
      one another, swelled into a general smile, that covered the whole surface
      of the basin.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;What an extraordinary meeting!&rsquo; said Tom. &lsquo;I should never have dreamed of
      seeing you two together here.&rsquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Quite accidental,&rsquo; John was heard to murmur.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Exactly,&rsquo; cried Tom; &lsquo;that&rsquo;s what I mean, you know. If it wasn&rsquo;t
      accidental, there would be nothing remarkable in it.&rsquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;To be sure,&rsquo; said John.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Such an out-of-the-way place for you to have met in,&rsquo; pursued Tom, quite
      delighted. &lsquo;Such an unlikely spot!&rsquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      John rather disputed that. On the contrary, he considered it a very likely
      spot, indeed. He was constantly passing to and fro there, he said. He
      shouldn&rsquo;t wonder if it were to happen again. His only wonder was, that it
      had never happened before.
    </p>
    <p>
      By this time Ruth had got round on the farther side of her brother, and
      had taken his arm. She was squeezing it now, as much as to say &lsquo;Are you
      going to stop here all day, you dear, old, blundering Tom?&rsquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      Tom answered the squeeze as if it had been a speech. &lsquo;John,&rsquo; he said, &lsquo;if
      you&rsquo;ll give my sister your arm, we&rsquo;ll take her between us, and walk on. I
      have a curious circumstance to relate to you. Our meeting could not have
      happened better.&rsquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      Merrily the fountain leaped and danced, and merrily the smiling dimples
      twinkled and expanded more and more, until they broke into a laugh against
      the basin&rsquo;s rim, and vanished.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Tom,&rsquo; said his friend, as they turned into the noisy street, &lsquo;I have a
      proposition to make. It is, that you and your sister&mdash;if she will so
      far honour a poor bachelor&rsquo;s dwelling&mdash;give me a great pleasure, and
      come and dine with me.&rsquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;What, to-day?&rsquo; cried Tom.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Yes, to-day. It&rsquo;s close by, you know. Pray, Miss Pinch, insist upon it.
      It will be very disinterested, for I have nothing to give you.&rsquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Oh! you must not believe that, Ruth,&rsquo; said Tom. &lsquo;He is the most
      tremendous fellow, in his housekeeping, that I ever heard of, for a single
      man. He ought to be Lord Mayor. Well! what do you say? Shall we go?&rsquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;If you please, Tom,&rsquo; rejoined his dutiful little sister.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;But I mean,&rsquo; said Tom, regarding her with smiling admiration; &lsquo;is there
      anything you ought to wear, and haven&rsquo;t got? I am sure I don&rsquo;t know, John;
      she may not be able to take her bonnet off, for anything I can tell.&rsquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      There was a great deal of laughing at this, and there were divers
      compliments from John Westlock&mdash;not compliments <i>he</i> said at least (and
      really he was right), but good, plain, honest truths, which no one could
      deny. Ruth laughed, and all that, but she made no objection; so it was an
      engagement.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;If I had known it a little sooner,&rsquo; said John, &lsquo;I would have tried
      another pudding. Not in rivalry; but merely to exalt that famous one. I
      wouldn&rsquo;t on any account have had it made with suet.&rsquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Why not?&rsquo; asked Tom.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Because that cookery-book advises suet,&rsquo; said John Westlock; &lsquo;and ours
      was made with flour and eggs.&rsquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Oh good gracious!&rsquo; cried Tom. &lsquo;Ours was made with flour and eggs, was it?
      Ha, ha, ha! A beefsteak pudding made with flour and eggs! Why anybody
      knows better than that. I know better than that! Ha, ha, ha!&rsquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      It is unnecessary to say that Tom had been present at the making of the
      pudding, and had been a devoted believer in it all through. But he was so
      delighted to have this joke against his busy little sister and was tickled
      to that degree at having found her out, that he stopped in Temple Bar to
      laugh; and it was no more to Tom, that he was anathematized and knocked
      about by the surly passengers, than it would have been to a post; for he
      continued to exclaim with unabated good humour, &lsquo;flour and eggs! A
      beefsteak pudding made with flour and eggs!&rsquo; until John Westlock and his
      sister fairly ran away from him, and left him to have his laugh out by
      himself; which he had, and then came dodging across the crowded street to
      them, with such sweet temper and tenderness (it was quite a tender joke of
      Tom&rsquo;s) beaming in his face, God bless it, that it might have purified the
      air, though Temple Bar had been, as in the golden days gone by,
      embellished with a row of rotting human heads.
    </p>
    <p>
      There are snug chambers in those Inns where the bachelors live, and, for
      the desolate fellows they pretend to be, it is quite surprising how well
      they get on. John was very pathetic on the subject of his dreary life, and
      the deplorable makeshifts and apologetic contrivances it involved, but he
      really seemed to make himself pretty comfortable. His rooms were the
      perfection of neatness and convenience at any rate; and if he were
      anything but comfortable, the fault was certainly not theirs.
    </p>
    <p>
      He had no sooner ushered Tom and his sister into his best room (where
      there was a beautiful little vase of fresh flowers on the table, all ready
      for Ruth. Just as if he had expected her, Tom said), than, seizing his
      hat, he bustled out again, in his most energetically bustling, way; and
      presently came hurrying back, as they saw through the half-opened door,
      attended by a fiery-faced matron attired in a crunched bonnet, with
      particularly long strings to it hanging down her back; in conjunction with
      whom he instantly began to lay the cloth for dinner, polishing up the
      wine-glasses with his own hands, brightening the silver top of the
      pepper-caster on his coat-sleeve, drawing corks and filling decanters,
      with a skill and expedition that were quite dazzling. And as if, in the
      course of this rubbing and polishing, he had rubbed an enchanted lamp or a
      magic ring, obedient to which there were twenty thousand supernatural
      slaves at least, suddenly there appeared a being in a white waistcoat,
      carrying under his arm a napkin, and attended by another being with an
      oblong box upon his head, from which a banquet, piping hot, was taken out
      and set upon the table.
    </p>
    <p>
      Salmon, lamb, peas, innocent young potatoes, a cool salad, sliced
      cucumber, a tender duckling, and a tart&mdash;all there. They all came at
      the right time. Where they came from, didn&rsquo;t appear; but the oblong box
      was constantly going and coming, and making its arrival known to the man
      in the white waistcoat by bumping modestly against the outside of the
      door; for, after its first appearance, it entered the room no more. He was
      never surprised, this man; he never seemed to wonder at the extraordinary
      things he found in the box, but took them out with a face expressive of a
      steady purpose and impenetrable character, and put them on the table. He
      was a kind man; gentle in his manners, and much interested in what they
      ate and drank. He was a learned man, and knew the flavour of John
      Westlock&rsquo;s private sauces, which he softly and feelingly described, as he
      handed the little bottles round. He was a grave man, and a noiseless; for
      dinner being done, and wine and fruit arranged upon the board, he
      vanished, box and all, like something that had never been.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Didn&rsquo;t I say he was a tremendous fellow in his housekeeping?&rsquo; cried Tom.
      &lsquo;Bless my soul! It&rsquo;s wonderful.&rsquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Ah, Miss Pinch,&rsquo; said John. &lsquo;This is the bright side of the life we lead
      in such a place. It would be a dismal life, indeed, if it didn&rsquo;t brighten
      up to-day&rsquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Don&rsquo;t believe a word he says,&rsquo; cried Tom. &lsquo;He lives here like a monarch,
      and wouldn&rsquo;t change his mode of life for any consideration. He only
      pretends to grumble.&rsquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      No, John really did not appear to pretend; for he was uncommonly earnest
      in his desire to have it understood that he was as dull, solitary, and
      uncomfortable on ordinary occasions as an unfortunate young man could, in
      reason, be. It was a wretched life, he said, a miserable life. He thought
      of getting rid of the chambers as soon as possible; and meant, in fact, to
      put a bill up very shortly.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Well&rsquo; said Tom Pinch, &lsquo;I don&rsquo;t know where you can go, John, to be more
      comfortable. That&rsquo;s all I can say. What do <i>you </i>say, Ruth?&rsquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      Ruth trifled with the cherries on her plate, and said that she thought Mr
      Westlock ought to be quite happy, and that she had no doubt he was.
    </p>
    <p>
      Ah, foolish, panting, frightened little heart, how timidly she said it!
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;But you are forgetting what you had to tell, Tom; what occurred this
      morning,&rsquo; she added in the same breath.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;So I am,&rsquo; said Tom. &lsquo;We have been so talkative on other topics that I
      declare I have not had time to think of it. I&rsquo;ll tell it you at once,
      John, in case I should forget it altogether.&rsquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      On Tom&rsquo;s relating what had passed upon the wharf, his friend was very much
      surprised, and took such a great interest in the narrative as Tom could
      not quite understand. He believed he knew the old lady whose acquaintance
      they had made, he said; and that he might venture to say, from their
      description of her, that her name was Gamp. But of what nature the
      communication could have been which Tom had borne so unexpectedly; why its
      delivery had been entrusted to him; how it happened that the parties were
      involved together; and what secret lay at the bottom of the whole affair;
      perplexed him very much. Tom had been sure of his taking some interest in
      the matter; but was not prepared for the strong interest he showed. It
      held John Westlock to the subject even after Ruth had left the room; and
      evidently made him anxious to pursue it further than as a mere subject of
      conversation.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;I shall remonstrate with my landlord, of course,&rsquo; said Tom; &lsquo;though he is
      a very singular secret sort of man, and not likely to afford me much
      satisfaction; even if he knew what was in the letter.&rsquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Which you may swear he did,&rsquo; John interposed.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;You think so?&rsquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;I am certain of it.&rsquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Well!&rsquo; said Tom, &lsquo;I shall remonstrate with him when I see him (he goes in
      and out in a strange way, but I will try to catch him tomorrow morning),
      on his having asked me to execute such an unpleasant commission. And I
      have been thinking, John, that if I went down to Mrs What&rsquo;s-her-name&rsquo;s in
      the City, where I was before, you know&mdash;Mrs Todgers&rsquo;s&mdash;to-morrow
      morning, I might find poor Mercy Pecksniff there, perhaps, and be able to
      explain to her how I came to have any hand in the business.&rsquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;You are perfectly right, Tom,&rsquo; returned his friend, after a short
      interval of reflection. &lsquo;You cannot do better. It is quite clear to me
      that whatever the business is, there is little good in it; and it is so
      desirable for you to disentangle yourself from any appearance of willful
      connection with it, that I would counsel you to see her husband, if you
      can, and wash your hands of it by a plain statement of the facts. I have a
      misgiving that there is something dark at work here, Tom. I will tell you
      why, at another time; when I have made an inquiry or two myself.&rsquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      All this sounded very mysterious to Tom Pinch. But as he knew he could
      rely upon his friend, he resolved to follow this advice.
    </p>
    <p>
      Ah, but it would have been a good thing to have had a coat of
      invisibility, wherein to have watched little Ruth, when she was left to
      herself in John Westlock&rsquo;s chambers, and John and her brother were talking
      thus, over their wine! The gentle way in which she tried to get up a
      little conversation with the fiery-faced matron in the crunched bonnet,
      who was waiting to attend her; after making a desperate rally in regard of
      her dress, and attiring herself in a washed-out yellow gown with sprigs of
      the same upon it, so that it looked like a tesselated work of pats of
      butter. That would have been pleasant. The grim and griffin-like
      inflexibility with which the fiery-faced matron repelled these engaging
      advances, as proceeding from a hostile and dangerous power, who could have
      no business there, unless it were to deprive her of a customer, or suggest
      what became of the self-consuming tea and sugar, and other general
      trifles. That would have been agreeable. The bashful, winning, glorious
      curiosity, with which little Ruth, when fiery-face was gone, peeped into
      the books and nick-nacks that were lying about, and had a particular
      interest in some delicate paper-matches on the chimney-piece; wondering
      who could have made them. That would have been worth seeing. The faltering
      hand with which she tied those flowers together; with which, almost
      blushing at her own fair self as imaged in the glass, she arranged them in
      her breast, and looking at them with her head aside, now half resolved to
      take them out again, now half resolved to leave them where they were. That
      would have been delightful!
    </p>
    <p>
      John seemed to think it all delightful; for coming in with Tom to tea, he
      took his seat beside her like a man enchanted. And when the tea-service
      had been removed, and Tom, sitting down at the piano, became absorbed in
      some of his old organ tunes, he was still beside her at the open window,
      looking out upon the twilight.
    </p>
    <p>
      There is little enough to see in Furnival&rsquo;s Inn. It is a shady, quiet
      place, echoing to the footsteps of the stragglers who have business there;
      and rather monotonous and gloomy on summer evenings. What gave it such a
      charm to them, that they remained at the window as unconscious of the
      flight of time as Tom himself, the dreamer, while the melodies which had
      so often soothed his spirit were hovering again about him! What power
      infused into the fading light, the gathering darkness; the stars that here
      and there appeared; the evening air, the City&rsquo;s hum and stir, the very
      chiming of the old church clocks; such exquisite enthrallment, that the
      divinest regions of the earth spread out before their eyes could not have
      held them captive in a stronger chain?
    </p>
    <p>
      The shadows deepened, deepened, and the room became quite dark. Still
      Tom&rsquo;s fingers wandered over the keys of the piano, and still the window
      had its pair of tenants. At length, her hand upon his shoulder, and her
      breath upon his forehead, roused Tom from his reverie.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Dear me!&rsquo; he cried, desisting with a start. &lsquo;I am afraid I have been very
      inconsiderate and unpolite.&rsquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      Tom little thought how much consideration and politeness he had shown!
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Sing something to us, my dear,&rsquo; said Tom, &lsquo;let us hear your voice. Come!&rsquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      John Westlock added his entreaties with such earnestness that a flinty
      heart alone could have resisted them. Hers was not a flinty heart. Oh,
      dear no! Quite another thing.
    </p>
    <p>
      So down she sat, and in a pleasant voice began to sing the ballads Tom
      loved well. Old rhyming stories, with here and there a pause for a few
      simple chords, such as a harper might have sounded in the ancient time
      while looking upward for the current of some half-remembered legend; words
      of old poets, wedded to such measures that the strain of music might have
      been the poet&rsquo;s breath, giving utterance and expression to his thoughts;
      and now a melody so joyous and light-hearted, that the singer seemed
      incapable of sadness, until in her inconstancy (oh wicked little singer!)
      she relapsed, and broke the listeners&rsquo; hearts again; these were the simple
      means she used to please them. And that these simple means prevailed, and
      she <i>did </i>please them, let the still darkened chamber, and its long-deferred
      illumination witness.
    </p>
    <p>
      The candles came at last, and it was time for moving homeward. Cutting
      paper carefully, and rolling it about the stalks of those same flowers,
      occasioned some delay; but even this was done in time, and Ruth was ready.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Good night!&rsquo; said Tom. &lsquo;A memorable and delightful visit, John! Good
      night!&rsquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      John thought he would walk with them.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;No, no. Don&rsquo;t!&rsquo; said Tom. &lsquo;What nonsense! We can get home very well
      alone. I couldn&rsquo;t think of taking you out.&rsquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      But John said he would rather.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Are you sure you would rather?&rsquo; said Tom. &lsquo;I am afraid you only say so
      out of politeness.&rsquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      John being quite sure, gave his arm to Ruth, and led her out. Fiery-face,
      who was again in attendance, acknowledged her departure with so cold a
      curtsey that it was hardly visible; and cut Tom, dead.
    </p>
    <p>
      Their host was bent on walking the whole distance, and would not listen to
      Tom&rsquo;s dissuasions. Happy time, happy walk, happy parting, happy dreams!
      But there are some sweet day-dreams, so there are that put the visions of
      the night to shame.
    </p>
    <p>
      Busily the Temple fountain murmured in the moonlight, while Ruth lay
      sleeping, with her flowers beside her; and John Westlock sketched a
      portrait&mdash;whose?&mdash;from memory.

    <h2>
      CHAPTER FORTY-SIX
    </h2>
    <p>
      IN WHICH MISS PECKSNIFF MAKES LOVE, MR JONAS MAKES WRATH, MRS GAMP MAKES
      TEA, AND MR CHUFFEY MAKES BUSINESS
    </p>
    <p>
      On the next day&rsquo;s official duties coming to a close, Tom hurried home
      without losing any time by the way; and after dinner and a short rest
      sallied out again, accompanied by Ruth, to pay his projected visit to
      Todgers&rsquo;s. Tom took Ruth with him, not only because it was a great
      pleasure to him to have her for his companion whenever he could, but
      because he wished her to cherish and comfort poor Merry; which she, for
      her own part (having heard the wretched history of that young wife from
      Tom), was all eagerness to do.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;She was so glad to see me,&rsquo; said Tom, &lsquo;that I am sure she will be glad to
      see you. Your sympathy is certain to be much more delicate and acceptable
      than mine.&rsquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;I am very far from being certain of that, Tom,&rsquo; she replied; &lsquo;and indeed
      you do yourself an injustice. Indeed you do. But I hope she may like me,
      Tom.&rsquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Oh, she is sure to do that!&rsquo; cried Tom, confidently.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;What a number of friends I should have, if everybody was of your way of
      thinking. Shouldn&rsquo;t I, Tom, dear?&rsquo; said his little sister pinching him
      upon the cheek.
    </p>
    <p>
      Tom laughed, and said that with reference to this particular case he had
      no doubt at all of finding a disciple in Merry. &lsquo;For you women,&rsquo; said Tom,
      &lsquo;you women, my dear, are so kind, and in your kindness have such nice
      perception; you know so well how to be affectionate and full of solicitude
      without appearing to be; your gentleness of feeling is like your touch so
      light and easy, that the one enables you to deal with wounds of the mind
      as tenderly as the other enables you to deal with wounds of the body. You
      are such&mdash;&rsquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;My goodness, Tom!&rsquo; his sister interposed. &lsquo;You ought to fall in love
      immediately.&rsquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      Tom put this observation off good humouredly, but somewhat gravely too;
      and they were soon very chatty again on some other subject.
    </p>
    <p>
      As they were passing through a street in the City, not very far from Mrs
      Todgers&rsquo;s place of residence, Ruth checked Tom before the window of a
      large Upholstery and Furniture Warehouse, to call his attention to
      something very magnificent and ingenious, displayed there to the best
      advantage, for the admiration and temptation of the public. Tom had
      hazarded some most erroneous and extravagantly wrong guess in relation to
      the price of this article, and had joined his sister in laughing heartily
      at his mistake, when he pressed her arm in his, and pointed to two persons
      at a little distance, who were looking in at the same window with a deep
      interest in the chests of drawers and tables.
    </p>
<div class="fig" style="width:65%">

    </div>
    <h5>
      <a href="images/20706.jpg"><i>Original</i></a>
    </h5>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Hush!&rsquo; Tom whispered. &lsquo;Miss Pecksniff, and the young gentleman to whom
      she is going to be married.&rsquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Why does he look as if he was going to be buried, Tom?&rsquo; inquired his
      little sister.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Why, he is naturally a dismal young gentleman, I believe,&rsquo; said Tom &lsquo;but
      he is very civil and inoffensive.&rsquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;I suppose they are furnishing their house,&rsquo; whispered Ruth.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Yes, I suppose they are,&rsquo; replied Tom. &lsquo;We had better avoid speaking to
      them.&rsquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      They could not very well avoid looking at them, however, especially as
      some obstruction on the pavement, at a little distance, happened to detain
      them where they were for a few moments. Miss Pecksniff had quite the air
      of having taken the unhappy Moddle captive, and brought him up to the
      contemplation of the furniture like a lamb to the altar. He offered no
      resistance, but was perfectly resigned and quiet. The melancholy depicted
      in the turn of his languishing head, and in his dejected attitude, was
      extreme; and though there was a full-sized four-post bedstead in the
      window, such a tear stood trembling in his eye as seemed to blot it out.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Augustus, my love,&rsquo; said Miss Pecksniff, &lsquo;ask the price of the eight
      rosewood chairs, and the loo table.&rsquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Perhaps they are ordered already,&rsquo; said Augustus. &lsquo;Perhaps they are
      Another&rsquo;s.&rsquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;They can make more like them, if they are,&rsquo; rejoined Miss Pecksniff.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;No, no, they can&rsquo;t,&rsquo; said Moddle. &lsquo;It&rsquo;s impossible!&rsquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      He appeared, for the moment, to be quite overwhelmed and stupefied by the
      prospect of his approaching happiness; but recovering, entered the shop.
      He returned immediately, saying in a tone of despair
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Twenty-four pound ten!&rsquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      Miss Pecksniff, turning to receive this announcement, became conscious of
      the observation of Tom Pinch and his sister.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Oh, really!&rsquo; cried Miss Pecksniff, glancing about her, as if for some
      convenient means of sinking into the earth. &lsquo;Upon my word, I&mdash;there
      never was such a&mdash;to think that one should be so very&mdash;Mr
      Augustus Moddle, Miss Pinch!&rsquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      Miss Pecksniff was quite gracious to Miss Pinch in this triumphant
      introduction; exceedingly gracious. She was more than gracious; she was
      kind and cordial. Whether the recollection of the old service Tom had
      rendered her in knocking Mr Jonas on the head had wrought this change in
      her opinions; or whether her separation from her parent had reconciled her
      to all human-kind, or to all that interesting portion of human-kind which
      was not friendly to him; or whether the delight of having some new female
      acquaintance to whom to communicate her interesting prospects was
      paramount to every other consideration; cordial and kind Miss Pecksniff
      was. And twice Miss Pecksniff kissed Miss Pinch upon the cheek.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Augustus&mdash;Mr Pinch, you know. My dear girl!&rsquo; said Miss Pecksniff,
      aside. &lsquo;I never was so ashamed in my life.&rsquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      Ruth begged her not to think of it.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;I mind your brother less than anybody else,&rsquo; simpered Miss Pecksniff.
      &lsquo;But the indelicacy of meeting any gentleman under such circumstances!
      Augustus, my child, did you&mdash;&rsquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      Here Miss Pecksniff whispered in his ear. The suffering Moddle repeated:
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Twenty-four pound ten!&rsquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Oh, you silly man! I don&rsquo;t mean them,&rsquo; said Miss Pecksniff. &lsquo;I am
      speaking of the&mdash;&rsquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      Here she whispered him again.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;If it&rsquo;s the same patterned chintz as that in the window; thirty-two,
      twelve, six,&rsquo; said Moddle, with a sigh. &lsquo;And very dear.&rsquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      Miss Pecksniff stopped him from giving any further explanation by laying
      her hand upon his lips, and betraying a soft embarrassment. She then asked
      Tom Pinch which way he was going.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;I was going to see if I could find your sister,&rsquo; answered Tom, &lsquo;to whom I
      wished to say a few words. We were going to Mrs Todgers&rsquo;s, where I had the
      pleasure of seeing her before.&rsquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;It&rsquo;s of no use your going on, then,&rsquo; said Cherry, &lsquo;for we have not long
      left there; and I know she is not at home. But I&rsquo;ll take you to my
      sister&rsquo;s house, if you please. Augustus&mdash;Mr Moddle, I mean&mdash;and
      myself, are on our way to tea there, now. You needn&rsquo;t think of <i>him</i>,&rsquo; she
      added, nodding her head as she observed some hesitation on Tom&rsquo;s part. &lsquo;He
      is not at home.&rsquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Are you sure?&rsquo; asked Tom.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Oh, I am quite sure of that. I don&rsquo;t want any <i>more </i>revenge,&rsquo; said Miss
      Pecksniff, expressively. &lsquo;But, really, I must beg you two gentlemen to
      walk on, and allow me to follow with Miss Pinch. My dear, I never was so
      taken by surprise!&rsquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      In furtherance of this bashful arrangement, Moddle gave his arm to Tom;
      and Miss Pecksniff linked her own in Ruth&rsquo;s.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Of course, my love,&rsquo; said Miss Pecksniff, &lsquo;it would be useless for me to
      disguise, after what you have seen, that I am about to be united to the
      gentleman who is walking with your brother. It would be in vain to conceal
      it. What do you think of him? Pray, let me have your candid opinion.&rsquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      Ruth intimated that, as far as she could judge, he was a very eligible
      swain.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;I am curious to know,&rsquo; said Miss Pecksniff, with loquacious frankness,
      &lsquo;whether you have observed, or fancied, in this very short space of time,
      that he is of a rather melancholy turn?&rsquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;So very short a time,&rsquo; Ruth pleaded.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;No, no; but don&rsquo;t let that interfere with your answer,&rsquo; returned Miss
      Pecksniff. &lsquo;I am curious to hear what you say.&rsquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      Ruth acknowledged that he had impressed her at first sight as looking
      &lsquo;rather low.&rsquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;No, really?&rsquo; said Miss Pecksniff. &lsquo;Well! that is quite remarkable!
      Everybody says the same. Mrs Todgers says the same; and Augustus informs
      me that it is quite a joke among the gentlemen in the house. Indeed, but
      for the positive commands I have laid upon him, I believe it would have
      been the occasion of loaded fire-arms being resorted to more than once.
      What do you think is the cause of his appearance of depression?&rsquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      Ruth thought of several things; such as his digestion, his tailor, his
      mother, and the like. But hesitating to give utterance to any one of them,
      she refrained from expressing an opinion.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;My dear,&rsquo; said Miss Pecksniff; &lsquo;I shouldn&rsquo;t wish it to be known, but I
      don&rsquo;t mind mentioning it to you, having known your brother for so many
      years&mdash;I refused Augustus three times. He is of a most amiable and
      sensitive nature, always ready to shed tears if you look at him, which is
      extremely charming; and he has never recovered the effect of that cruelty.
      For it <i>was </i>cruel,&rsquo; said Miss Pecksniff, with a self-conviction candour
      that might have adorned the diadem of her own papa. &lsquo;There is no doubt of
      it. I look back upon my conduct now with blushes. I always liked him. I
      felt that he was not to me what the crowd of young men who had made
      proposals had been, but something very different. Then what right had I to
      refuse him three times?&rsquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;It was a severe trial of his fidelity, no doubt,&rsquo; said Ruth.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;My dear,&rsquo; returned Miss Pecksniff. &lsquo;It was wrong. But such is the caprice
      and thoughtlessness of our sex! Let me be a warning to you. Don&rsquo;t try the
      feelings of any one who makes you an offer, as I have tried the feelings
      of Augustus; but if you ever feel towards a person as I really felt
      towards him, at the very time when I was driving him to distraction, let
      that feeling find expression, if that person throws himself at your feet,
      as Augustus Moddle did at mine. Think,&rsquo; said Miss Pecksniff, &lsquo;what my
      feelings would have been, if I had goaded him to suicide, and it had got
      into the papers!&rsquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      Ruth observed that she would have been full of remorse, no doubt.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Remorse!&rsquo; cried Miss Pecksniff, in a sort of snug and comfortable
      penitence. &lsquo;What my remorse is at this moment, even after making
      reparation by accepting him, it would be impossible to tell you! Looking
      back upon my giddy self, my dear, now that I am sobered down and made
      thoughtful, by treading on the very brink of matrimony; and contemplating
      myself as I was when I was like what you are now; I shudder. I shudder.
      What is the consequence of my past conduct? Until Augustus leads me to the
      altar he is not sure of me. I have blighted and withered the affections of
      his heart to that extent that he is not sure of me. I see that preying on
      his mind and feeding on his vitals. What are the reproaches of my
      conscience, when I see this in the man I love!&rsquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      Ruth endeavoured to express some sense of her unbounded and flattering
      confidence; and presumed that she was going to be married soon.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Very soon indeed,&rsquo; returned Miss Pecksniff. &lsquo;As soon as our house is
      ready. We are furnishing now as fast as we can.&rsquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      In the same vein of confidence Miss Pecksniff ran through a general
      inventory of the articles that were already bought with the articles that
      remained to be purchased; what garments she intended to be married in, and
      where the ceremony was to be performed; and gave Miss Pinch, in short (as
      she told her), early and exclusive information on all points of interest
      connected with the event.
    </p>
    <p>
      While this was going forward in the rear, Tom and Mr Moddle walked on, arm
      in arm, in the front, in a state of profound silence, which Tom at last
      broke; after thinking for a long time what he could say that should refer
      to an indifferent topic, in respect of which he might rely, with some
      degree of certainty, on Mr Moddle&rsquo;s bosom being unruffled.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;I wonder,&rsquo; said Tom, &lsquo;that in these crowded streets the foot-passengers
      are not oftener run over.&rsquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      Mr Moddle, with a dark look, replied:
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;The drivers won&rsquo;t do it.&rsquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Do you mean?&rsquo; Tom began&mdash;
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;That there are some men,&rsquo; interrupted Moddle, with a hollow laugh, &lsquo;who
      can&rsquo;t get run over. They live a charmed life. Coal waggons recoil from
      them, and even cabs refuse to run them down. Ah!&rsquo; said Augustus, marking
      Tom&rsquo;s astonishment. &lsquo;There are such men. One of &lsquo;em is a friend of mine.&rsquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Upon my word and honour,&rsquo; thought Tom, &lsquo;this young gentleman is in a
      state of mind which is very serious indeed!&rsquo; Abandoning all idea of
      conversation, he did not venture to say another word, but he was careful
      to keep a tight hold upon Augustus&rsquo;s arm, lest he should fly into the
      road, and making another and a more successful attempt, should get up a
      private little Juggernaut before the eyes of his betrothed. Tom was so
      afraid of his committing this rash act, that he had scarcely ever
      experienced such mental relief as when they arrived in safety at Mrs Jonas
      Chuzzlewit&rsquo;s house.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Walk up, pray, Mr Pinch,&rsquo; said Miss Pecksniff. For Tom halted,
      irresolutely, at the door.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;I am doubtful whether I should be welcome,&rsquo; replied Tom, &lsquo;or, I ought
      rather to say, I have no doubt about it. I will send up a message, I
      think.&rsquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;But what nonsense that is!&rsquo; returned Miss Pecksniff, speaking apart to
      Tom. &lsquo;He is not at home, I am certain. I know he is not; and Merry hasn&rsquo;t
      the least idea that you ever&mdash;&rsquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;No,&rsquo; interrupted Tom. &lsquo;Nor would I have her know it, on any account. I am
      not so proud of that scuffle, I assure you.&rsquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Ah, but then you are so modest, you see,&rsquo; returned Miss Pecksniff, with a
      smile. &lsquo;But pray walk up. If you don&rsquo;t wish her to know it, and do wish to
      speak to her, pray walk up. Pray walk up, Miss Pinch. Don&rsquo;t stand here.&rsquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      Tom still hesitated for he felt that he was in an awkward position. But
      Cherry passing him at this juncture, and leading his sister upstairs, and
      the house-door being at the same time shut behind them, he followed
      without quite knowing whether it was well or ill-judged so to do.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Merry, my darling!&rsquo; said the fair Miss Pecksniff, opening the door of the
      usual sitting-room. &lsquo;Here are Mr Pinch and his sister come to see you! I
      thought we should find you here, Mrs Todgers! How do you do, Mrs Gamp? And
      how do you do, Mr Chuffey, though it&rsquo;s of no use asking you the question,
      I am well aware.&rsquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      Honouring each of these parties, as she severally addressed them, with an
      acid smile, Miss Charity presented &lsquo;Mr Moddle.&rsquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;I believe you have seen <i>him </i>before,&rsquo; she pleasantly observed. &lsquo;Augustus,
      my sweet child, bring me a chair.&rsquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      The sweet child did as he was told; and was then about to retire into a
      corner to mourn in secret, when Miss Charity, calling him in an audible
      whisper a &lsquo;little pet,&rsquo; gave him leave to come and sit beside her. It is
      to be hoped, for the general cheerfulness of mankind, that such a doleful
      little pet was never seen as Mr Moddle looked when he complied. So
      despondent was his temper, that he showed no outward thrill of ecstasy
      when Miss Pecksniff placed her lily hand in his, and concealed this mark
      of her favour from the vulgar gaze by covering it with a corner of her
      shawl. Indeed, he was infinitely more rueful then than he had been before;
      and, sitting uncomfortably upright in his chair, surveyed the company with
      watery eyes, which seemed to say, without the aid of language, &lsquo;Oh, good
      gracious! look here! Won&rsquo;t some kind Christian help me!&rsquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      But the ecstasies of Mrs Gamp were sufficient to have furnished forth a
      score of young lovers; and they were chiefly awakened by the sight of Tom
      Pinch and his sister. Mrs Gamp was a lady of that happy temperament which
      can be ecstatic without any other stimulating cause than a general desire
      to establish a large and profitable connection. She added daily so many
      strings to her bow, that she made a perfect harp of it; and upon that
      instrument she now began to perform an extemporaneous concerto.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Why, goodness me!&rsquo; she said, &lsquo;Mrs Chuzzlewit! To think as I should see
      beneath this blessed &lsquo;ouse, which well I know it, Miss Pecksniff, my sweet
      young lady, to be a &lsquo;ouse as there is not a many like, worse luck, and
      wishin&rsquo; it were not so, which then this tearful walley would be changed
      into a flowerin&rsquo; guardian, Mr Chuffey; to think as I should see beneath
      this indiwidgle roof, identically comin&rsquo;, Mr Pinch (I take the liberty,
      though almost unbeknown), and do assure you of it, sir, the smilinest and
      sweetest face as ever, Mrs Chuzzlewit, I see exceptin&rsquo; yourn, my dear good
      lady, and <i>your </i>good lady&rsquo;s too, sir, Mr Moddle, if I may make so bold as
      speak so plain of what is plain enough to them as needn&rsquo;t look through
      millstones, Mrs Todgers, to find out wot is wrote upon the wall behind.
      Which no offence is meant, ladies and gentlemen; none bein&rsquo; took, I hope.
      To think as I should see that smilinest and sweetest face which me and
      another friend of mine, took notice of among the packages down London
      Bridge, in this promiscous place, is a surprige in-deed!&rsquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      Having contrived, in this happy manner, to invest every member of her
      audience with an individual share and immediate personal interest in her
      address, Mrs Gamp dropped several curtseys to Ruth, and smilingly shaking
      her head a great many times, pursued the thread of her discourse:
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Now, ain&rsquo;t we rich in beauty this here joyful arternoon, I&rsquo;m sure. I
      knows a lady, which her name, I&rsquo;ll not deceive you, Mrs Chuzzlewit, is
      Harris, her husband&rsquo;s brother bein&rsquo; six foot three, and marked with a mad
      bull in Wellington boots upon his left arm, on account of his precious
      mother havin&rsquo; been worrited by one into a shoemaker&rsquo;s shop, when in a
      sitiwation which blessed is the man as has his quiver full of sech, as
      many times I&rsquo;ve said to Gamp when words has roge betwixt us on account of
      the expense&mdash;and often have I said to Mrs Harris, &ldquo;Oh, Mrs Harris,
      ma&rsquo;am! your countenance is quite a angel&rsquo;s!&rdquo; Which, but for Pimples, it
      would be. &ldquo;No, Sairey Gamp,&rdquo; says she, &ldquo;you best of hard-working and
      industrious creeturs as ever was underpaid at any price, which underpaid
      you are, quite diff&rsquo;rent. Harris had it done afore marriage at ten and
      six,&rdquo; she says, &ldquo;and wore it faithful next his heart till the colour run,
      when the money was declined to be give back, and no arrangement could be
      come to. But he never said it was a angel&rsquo;s, Sairey, wotever he might have
      thought.&rdquo; If Mrs Harris&rsquo;s husband was here now,&rsquo; said Mrs Gamp, looking
      round, and chuckling as she dropped a general curtsey, &lsquo;he&rsquo;d speak out
      plain, he would, and his dear wife would be the last to blame him! For if
      ever a woman lived as know&rsquo;d not wot it was to form a wish to pizon them
      as had good looks, and had no reagion give her by the best of husbands,
      Mrs Harris is that ev&rsquo;nly dispogician!&rsquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      With these words the worthy woman, who appeared to have dropped in to take
      tea as a delicate little attention, rather than to have any engagement on
      the premises in an official capacity, crossed to Mr Chuffey, who was
      seated in the same corner as of old, and shook him by the shoulder.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Rouge yourself, and look up! Come!&rsquo; said Mrs Gamp. &lsquo;Here&rsquo;s company, Mr
      Chuffey.&rsquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;I am sorry for it,&rsquo; cried the old man, looking humbly round the room. &lsquo;I
      know I&rsquo;m in the way. I ask pardon, but I&rsquo;ve nowhere else to go to. Where
      is she?&rsquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      Merry went to him.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Ah!&rsquo; said the old man, patting her on the check. &lsquo;Here she is. Here she
      is! She&rsquo;s never hard on poor old Chuffey. Poor old Chuff!&rsquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      As she took her seat upon a low chair by the old man&rsquo;s side, and put
      herself within the reach of his hand, she looked up once at Tom. It was a
      sad look that she cast upon him, though there was a faint smile trembling
      on her face. It was a speaking look, and Tom knew what it said. &lsquo;You see
      how misery has changed me. I can feel for a dependant <i>now</i>, and set some
      value on his attachment.&rsquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Aye, aye!&rsquo; cried Chuffey in a soothing tone. &lsquo;Aye, aye, aye! Never mind
      him. It&rsquo;s hard to hear, but never mind him. He&rsquo;ll die one day. There are
      three hundred and sixty-five days in the year&mdash;three hundred and
      sixty-six in leap year&mdash;and he may die on any one of &lsquo;em.&rsquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;You&rsquo;re a wearing old soul, and that&rsquo;s the sacred truth,&rsquo; said Mrs Gamp,
      contemplating him from a little distance with anything but favour, as he
      continued to mutter to himself. &lsquo;It&rsquo;s a pity that you don&rsquo;t know wot you
      say, for you&rsquo;d tire your own patience out if you did, and fret yourself
      into a happy releage for all as knows you.&rsquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;His son,&rsquo; murmured the old man, lifting up his hand. &lsquo;His son!&rsquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Well, I&rsquo;m sure!&rsquo; said Mrs Gamp, &lsquo;you&rsquo;re a-settlin&rsquo; of it, Mr Chuffey. To
      your satigefaction, sir, I hope. But I wouldn&rsquo;t lay a new pincushion on it
      myself, sir, though you <i>are </i>so well informed. Drat the old creetur, he&rsquo;s
      a-layin&rsquo; down the law tolerable confident, too! A deal he knows of sons!
      or darters either! Suppose you was to favour us with some remarks on
      twins, sir, <i>would </i>you be so good!&rsquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      The bitter and indignant sarcasm which Mrs Gamp conveyed into these taunts
      was altogether lost on the unconscious Chuffey, who appeared to be as
      little cognizant of their delivery as of his having given Mrs Gamp
      offence. But that high-minded woman being sensitively alive to any
      invasion of her professional province, and imagining that Mr Chuffey had
      given utterance to some prediction on the subject of sons, which ought to
      have emanated in the first instance from herself as the only lawful
      authority, or which should at least have been on no account proclaimed
      without her sanction and concurrence, was not so easily appeased. She
      continued to sidle at Mr Chuffey with looks of sharp hostility, and to
      defy him with many other ironical remarks, uttered in that low key which
      commonly denotes suppressed indignation; until the entrance of the
      teaboard, and a request from Mrs Jonas that she would make tea at a
      side-table for the party that had unexpectedly assembled, restored her to
      herself. She smiled again, and entered on her ministration with her own
      particular urbanity.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;And quite a family it is to make tea for,&rsquo; said Mrs Gamp; &lsquo;and wot a
      happiness to do it! My good young &lsquo;ooman&rsquo;&mdash;to the servant-girl&mdash;&lsquo;p&rsquo;raps
      somebody would like to try a new-laid egg or two, not biled too hard.
      Likeways, a few rounds o&rsquo; buttered toast, first cuttin&rsquo; off the crust, in
      consequence of tender teeth, and not too many of &lsquo;em; which Gamp himself,
      Mrs Chuzzlewit, at one blow, being in liquor, struck out four, two single,
      and two double, as was took by Mrs Harris for a keepsake, and is carried
      in her pocket at this present hour, along with two cramp-bones, a bit o&rsquo;
      ginger, and a grater like a blessed infant&rsquo;s shoe, in tin, with a little
      heel to put the nutmeg in; as many times I&rsquo;ve seen and said, and used for
      candle when required, within the month.&rsquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      As the privileges of the side-table&mdash;besides including the small
      prerogatives of sitting next the toast, and taking two cups of tea to
      other people&rsquo;s one, and always taking them at a crisis, that is to say,
      before putting fresh water into the tea-pot, and after it had been
      standing for some time&mdash;also comprehended a full view of the company,
      and an opportunity of addressing them as from a rostrum, Mrs Gamp
      discharged the functions entrusted to her with extreme good-humour and
      affability. Sometimes resting her saucer on the palm of her outspread
      hand, and supporting her elbow on the table, she stopped between her sips
      of tea to favour the circle with a smile, a wink, a roll of the head, or
      some other mark of notice; and at those periods her countenance was
      lighted up with a degree of intelligence and vivacity, which it was almost
      impossible to separate from the benignant influence of distilled waters.

    <p>
      But for Mrs Gamp, it would have been a curiously silent party. Miss
      Pecksniff only spoke to her Augustus, and to him in whispers. Augustus
      spoke to nobody, but sighed for every one, and occasionally gave himself
      such a sounding slap upon the forehead as would make Mrs Todgers, who was
      rather nervous, start in her chair with an involuntary exclamation. Mrs
      Todgers was occupied in knitting, and seldom spoke. Poor Merry held the
      hand of cheerful little Ruth between her own, and listening with evident
      pleasure to all she said, but rarely speaking herself, sometimes smiled,
      and sometimes kissed her on the cheek, and sometimes turned aside to hide
      the tears that trembled in her eyes. Tom felt this change in her so much,
      and was so glad to see how tenderly Ruth dealt with her, and how she knew
      and answered to it, that he had not the heart to make any movement towards
      their departure, although he had long since given utterance to all he came
      to say.
    </p>
    <p>
      The old clerk, subsiding into his usual state, remained profoundly silent,
      while the rest of the little assembly were thus occupied, intent upon the
      dreams, whatever they might be, which hardly seemed to stir the surface of
      his sluggish thoughts. The bent of these dull fancies combining probably
      with the silent feasting that was going on about him, and some struggling
      recollection of the last approach to revelry he had witnessed, suggested a
      strange question to his mind. He looked round upon a sudden, and said:
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Who&rsquo;s lying dead upstairs?&rsquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;No one,&rsquo; said Merry, turning to him. &lsquo;What is the matter? We are all
      here.&rsquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;All here!&rsquo; cried the old man. &lsquo;All here! Where is he then&mdash;my old
      master, Mr Chuzzlewit, who had the only son? Where is he?&rsquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Hush! Hush!&rsquo; said Merry, speaking kindly to him. &lsquo;That happened long ago.
      Don&rsquo;t you recollect?&rsquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Recollect!&rsquo; rejoined the old man, with a cry of grief. &lsquo;As if I could
      forget! As if I ever could forget!&rsquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      He put his hand up to his face for a moment; and then repeated turning
      round exactly as before:
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Who&rsquo;s lying dead upstairs?&rsquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;No one!&rsquo; said Merry.
    </p>
    <p>
      At first he gazed angrily upon her, as upon a stranger who endeavoured to
      deceive him; but peering into her face, and seeing that it was indeed she,
      he shook his head in sorrowful compassion.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;You think not. But they don&rsquo;t tell you. No, no, poor thing! They don&rsquo;t
      tell you. Who are these, and why are they merry-making here, if there is
      no one dead? Foul play! Go see who it is!&rsquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      She made a sign to them not to speak to him, which indeed they had little
      inclination to do; and remained silent herself. So did he for a short
      time; but then he repeated the same question with an eagerness that had a
      peculiar terror in it.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;There&rsquo;s some one dead,&rsquo; he said, &lsquo;or dying; and I want to knows who it
      is. Go see, go see! Where&rsquo;s Jonas?&rsquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;In the country,&rsquo; she replied.
    </p>
    <p>
      The old man gazed at her as if he doubted what she said, or had not heard
      her; and, rising from his chair, walked across the room and upstairs,
      whispering as he went, &lsquo;Foul play!&rsquo; They heard his footsteps overhead,
      going up into that corner of the room in which the bed stood (it was there
      old Anthony had died); and then they heard him coming down again
      immediately. His fancy was not so strong or wild that it pictured to him
      anything in the deserted bedchamber which was not there; for he returned
      much calmer, and appeared to have satisfied himself.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;They don&rsquo;t tell you,&rsquo; he said to Merry in his quavering voice, as he sat
      down again, and patted her upon the head. &lsquo;They don&rsquo;t tell me either; but
      I&rsquo;ll watch, I&rsquo;ll watch. They shall not hurt you; don&rsquo;t be frightened. When
      you have sat up watching, I have sat up watching too. Aye, aye, I have!&rsquo;
      he piped out, clenching his weak, shrivelled hand. &lsquo;Many a night I have
      been ready!&rsquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      He said this with such trembling gaps and pauses in his want of breath,
      and said it in his jealous secrecy so closely in her ear, that little or
      nothing of it was understood by the visitors. But they had heard and seen
      enough of the old man to be disquieted, and to have left their seats and
      gathered about him; thereby affording Mrs Gamp, whose professional
      coolness was not so easily disturbed, an eligible opportunity for
      concentrating the whole resources of her powerful mind and appetite upon
      the toast and butter, tea and eggs. She had brought them to bear upon
      those viands with such vigour that her face was in the highest state of
      inflammation, when she now (there being nothing left to eat or drink) saw
      fit to interpose.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Why, highty tighty, sir!&rsquo; cried Mrs Gamp, &lsquo;is these your manners? You
      want a pitcher of cold water throw&rsquo;d over you to bring you round; that&rsquo;s
      my belief, and if you was under Betsey Prig you&rsquo;d have it, too, I do
      assure you, Mr Chuffey. Spanish Flies is the only thing to draw this
      nonsense out of you; and if anybody wanted to do you a kindness, they&rsquo;d
      clap a blister of &lsquo;em on your head, and put a mustard poultige on your
      back. &lsquo;Who&rsquo;s dead, indeed! It wouldn&rsquo;t be no grievous loss if some one
      was, I think!&rsquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;He&rsquo;s quiet now, Mrs Gamp,&rsquo; said Merry. &lsquo;Don&rsquo;t disturb him.&rsquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Oh, bother the old wictim, Mrs Chuzzlewit,&rsquo; replied that zealous lady, &lsquo;I
      ain&rsquo;t no patience with him. You give him his own way too much by half. A
      worritin&rsquo; wexagious creetur!&rsquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      No doubt with the view of carrying out the precepts she enforced, and
      &lsquo;bothering the old wictim&rsquo; in practice as well as in theory, Mrs Gamp took
      him by the collar of his coat, and gave him some dozen or two of hearty
      shakes backward and forward in his chair; that exercise being considered
      by the disciples of the Prig school of nursing (who are very numerous
      among professional ladies) as exceedingly conducive to repose, and highly
      beneficial to the performance of the nervous functions. Its effect in this
      instance was to render the patient so giddy and addle-headed, that he
      could say nothing more; which Mrs Gamp regarded as the triumph of her art.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;There!&rsquo; she said, loosening the old man&rsquo;s cravat, in consequence of his
      being rather black in the face, after this scientific treatment. &lsquo;Now, I
      hope, you&rsquo;re easy in your mind. If you should turn at all faint we can
      soon rewive you, sir, I promige you. Bite a person&rsquo;s thumbs, or turn their
      fingers the wrong way,&rsquo; said Mrs Gamp, smiling with the consciousness of
      at once imparting pleasure and instruction to her auditors, &lsquo;and they
      comes to, wonderful, Lord bless you!&rsquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      As this excellent woman had been formerly entrusted with the care of Mr
      Chuffey on a previous occasion, neither Mrs Jonas nor anybody else had the
      resolution to interfere directly with her mode of treatment; though all
      present (Tom Pinch and his sister especially) appeared to be disposed to
      differ from her views. For such is the rash boldness of the uninitiated,
      that they will frequently set up some monstrous abstract principle, such
      as humanity, or tenderness, or the like idle folly, in obstinate defiance
      of all precedent and usage; and will even venture to maintain the same
      against the persons who have made the precedents and established the
      usage, and who must therefore be the best and most impartial judges of the
      subject.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Ah, Mr Pinch!&rsquo; said Miss Pecksniff. &lsquo;It all comes of this unfortunate
      marriage. If my sister had not been so precipitate, and had not united
      herself to a Wretch, there would have been no Mr Chuffey in the house.&rsquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Hush!&rsquo; cried Tom. &lsquo;She&rsquo;ll hear you.&rsquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;I should be very sorry if she did hear me, Mr Pinch,&rsquo; said Cherry,
      raising her voice a little; &lsquo;for it is not in my nature to add to the
      uneasiness of any person; far less of my own sister. I know what a
      sister&rsquo;s duties are, Mr Pinch, and I hope I always showed it in my
      practice. Augustus, my dear child, find my pocket-handkerchief, and give
      it to me.&rsquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      Augustus obeyed, and took Mrs Todgers aside to pour his griefs into her
      friendly bosom.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;I am sure, Mr Pinch,&rsquo; said Charity, looking after her betrothed and
      glancing at her sister, &lsquo;that I ought to be very grateful for the
      blessings I enjoy, and those which are yet in store for me. When I
      contrast Augustus&rsquo;&mdash;here she was modest and embarrased&mdash;&lsquo;who, I
      don&rsquo;t mind saying to you, is all softness, mildness, and devotion, with
      the detestable man who is my sister&rsquo;s husband; and when I think, Mr Pinch,
      that in the dispensations of this world, our cases might have been
      reversed; I have much to be thankful for, indeed, and much to make me
      humble and contented.&rsquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      Contented she might have been, but humble she assuredly was not. Her face
      and manner experienced something so widely different from humility, that
      Tom could not help understanding and despising the base motives that were
      working in her breast. He turned away, and said to Ruth, that it was time
      for them to go.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;I will write to your husband,&rsquo; said Tom to Merry, &lsquo;and explain to him, as
      I would have done if I had met him here, that if he has sustained any
      inconvenience through my means, it is not my fault; a postman not being
      more innocent of the news he brings, than I was when I handed him that
      letter.&rsquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;I thank you!&rsquo; said Merry. &lsquo;It may do some good.&rsquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      She parted tenderly from Ruth, who with her brother was in the act of
      leaving the room, when a key was heard in the lock of the door below, and
      immediately afterwards a quick footstep in the passage. Tom stopped, and
      looked at Merry.
    </p>
    <p>
      It was Jonas, she said timidly.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;I had better not meet him on the stairs, perhaps,&rsquo; said Tom, drawing his
      sister&rsquo;s arm through his, and coming back a step or two. &lsquo;I&rsquo;ll wait for
      him here, a moment.&rsquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      He had scarcely said it when the door opened, and Jonas entered. His wife
      came forward to receive him; but he put her aside with his hand, and said
      in a surly tone:
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;I didn&rsquo;t know you&rsquo;d got a party.&rsquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      As he looked, at the same time, either by accident or design, towards Miss
      Pecksniff; and as Miss Pecksniff was only too delighted to quarrel with
      him, she instantly resented it.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Oh dear!&rsquo; she said, rising. &lsquo;Pray don&rsquo;t let us intrude upon your domestic
      happiness! That would be a pity. We have taken tea here, sir, in your
      absence; but if you will have the goodness to send us a note of the
      expense, receipted, we shall be happy to pay it. Augustus, my love, we
      will go, if you please. Mrs Todgers, unless you wish to remain here, we
      shall be happy to take you with us. It would be a pity, indeed, to spoil
      the bliss which this gentleman always brings with him, especially into his
      own home.&rsquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Charity! Charity!&rsquo; remonstrated her sister, in such a heartfelt tone that
      she might have been imploring her to show the cardinal virtue whose name
      she bore.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Merry, my dear, I am much obliged to you for your advice,&rsquo; returned Miss
      Pecksniff, with a stately scorn&mdash;by the way, she had not been offered
      any&mdash;&lsquo;but I am not his slave&mdash;&rsquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;No, nor wouldn&rsquo;t have been if you could,&rsquo; interrupted Jonas. &lsquo;We know all
      about it.&rsquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;<i>What </i>did you say, sir?&rsquo; cried Miss Pecksniff, sharply.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Didn&rsquo;t you hear?&rsquo; retorted Jonas, lounging down upon a chair. &lsquo;I am not
      a-going to say it again. If you like to stay, you may stay. If you like to
      go, you may go. But if you stay, please to be civil.&rsquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Beast!&rsquo; cried Miss Pecksniff, sweeping past him. &lsquo;Augustus! He is beneath
      your notice!&rsquo; Augustus had been making some faint and sickly demonstration
      of shaking his fist. &lsquo;Come away, child,&rsquo; screamed Miss Pecksniff, &lsquo;I
      command you!&rsquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      The scream was elicited from her by Augustus manifesting an intention to
      return and grapple with him. But Miss Pecksniff giving the fiery youth a
      pull, and Mrs Todgers giving him a push they all three tumbled out of the
      room together, to the music of Miss Pecksniff&rsquo;s shrill remonstrances.
    </p>
    <p>
      All this time Jonas had seen nothing of Tom and his sister; for they were
      almost behind the door when he opened it, and he had sat down with his
      back towards them, and had purposely kept his eyes upon the opposite side
      of the street during his altercation with Miss Pecksniff, in order that
      his seeming carelessness might increase the exasperation of that wronged
      young damsel. His wife now faltered out that Tom had been waiting to see
      him; and Tom advanced.
    </p>
    <p>
      The instant he presented himself, Jonas got up from his chair, and
      swearing a great oath, caught it in his grasp, as if he would have felled
      Tom to the ground with it. As he most unquestionably would have done, but
      that his very passion and surprise made him irresolute, and gave Tom, in
      his calmness, an opportunity of being heard.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;You have no cause to be violent, sir,&rsquo; said Tom. &lsquo;Though what I wish to
      say relates to your own affairs, I know nothing of them, and desire to
      know nothing of them.&rsquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      Jonas was too enraged to speak. He held the door open; and stamping his
      foot upon the ground, motioned Tom away.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;As you cannot suppose,&rsquo; said Tom, &lsquo;that I am here with any view of
      conciliating you or pleasing myself, I am quite indifferent to your
      reception of me, or your dismissal of me. Hear what I have to say, if you
      are not a madman! I gave you a letter the other day, when you were about
      to go abroad.&rsquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;You Thief, you did!&rsquo; retorted Jonas. &lsquo;I&rsquo;ll pay you for the carriage of it
      one day, and settle an old score besides. I will!&rsquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Tut, tut,&rsquo; said Tom, &lsquo;you needn&rsquo;t waste words or threats. I wish you to
      understand&mdash;plainly because I would rather keep clear of you and
      everything that concerns you: not because I have the least apprehension of
      your doing me any injury: which would be weak indeed&mdash;that I am no
      party to the contents of that letter. That I know nothing of it. That I
      was not even aware that it was to be delivered to you; and that I had it
      from&mdash;&rsquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;By the Lord!&rsquo; cried Jonas, fiercely catching up the chair, &lsquo;I&rsquo;ll knock
      your brains out, if you speak another word.&rsquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      Tom, nevertheless, persisting in his intention, and opening his lips to
      speak again, Jonas set upon him like a savage; and in the quickness and
      ferocity of his attack would have surely done him some grievous injury,
      defenceless as he was, and embarrassed by having his frightened sister
      clinging to his arm, if Merry had not run between them, crying to Tom for
      the love of Heaven to leave the house. The agony of this poor creature,
      the terror of his sister, the impossibility of making himself audible, and
      the equal impossibility of bearing up against Mrs Gamp, who threw herself
      upon him like a feather-bed, and forced him backwards down the stairs by
      the mere oppression of her dead weight, prevailed. Tom shook the dust of
      that house off his feet, without having mentioned Nadgett&rsquo;s name.
    </p>
    <p>
      If the name could have passed his lips; if Jonas, in the insolence of his
      vile nature, had never roused him to do that old act of manliness, for
      which (and not for his last offence) he hated him with such malignity; if
      Jonas could have learned, as then he could and would have learned, through
      Tom&rsquo;s means, what unsuspected spy there was upon him; he would have been
      saved from the commission of a Guilty Deed, then drawing on towards its
      black accomplishment. But the fatality was of his own working; the pit was
      of his own digging; the gloom that gathered round him was the shadow of
      his own life.
    </p>
    <p>
      His wife had closed the door, and thrown herself before it, on the ground,
      upon her knees. She held up her hands to him now, and besought him not to
      be harsh with her, for she had interposed in fear of bloodshed.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;So, so!&rsquo; said Jonas, looking down upon her, as he fetched his breath.
      &lsquo;These are your friends, are they, when I am away? You plot and tamper
      with this sort of people, do you?&rsquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;No, indeed! I have no knowledge of these secrets, and no clue to their
      meaning. I have never seen him since I left home but once&mdash;but twice&mdash;before
      to-day.&rsquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Oh!&rsquo; sneered Jonas, catching at this correction. &lsquo;But once, but twice,
      eh? Which do you mean? Twice and once, perhaps. Three times! How many
      more, you lying jade?&rsquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      As he made an angry motion with his hand, she shrunk down hastily. A
      suggestive action! Full of a cruel truth!
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;How many more times?&rsquo; he repeated.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;No more. The other morning, and to-day, and once besides.&rsquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      He was about to retort upon her, when the clock struck. He started
      stopped, and listened; appearing to revert to some engagement, or to some
      other subject, a secret within his own breast, recalled to him by this
      record of the progress of the hours.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Don&rsquo;t lie there! Get up!&rsquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      Having helped her to rise, or rather hauled her up by the arm, he went on
      to say:
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Listen to me, young lady; and don&rsquo;t whine when you have no occasion, or I
      may make some for you. If I find him in my house again, or find that you
      have seen him in anybody else&rsquo;s house, you&rsquo;ll repent it. If you are not
      deaf and dumb to everything that concerns me, unless you have my leave to
      hear and speak, you&rsquo;ll repent it. If you don&rsquo;t obey exactly what I order,
      you&rsquo;ll repent it. Now, attend. What&rsquo;s the time?&rsquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;It struck eight a minute ago.&rsquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      He looked towards her intently; and said, with a laboured distinctness, as
      if he had got the words off by heart:
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;I have been travelling day and night, and am tired. I have lost some
      money, and that don&rsquo;t improve me. Put my supper in the little off-room
      below, and have the truckle-bed made. I shall sleep there to-night, and
      maybe to-morrow night; and if I can sleep all day to-morrow, so much the
      better, for I&rsquo;ve got trouble to sleep off, if I can. Keep the house quiet,
      and don&rsquo;t call me. Mind! Don&rsquo;t call me. Don&rsquo;t let anybody call me. Let me
      lie there.&rsquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      She said it should be done. Was that all?
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;All what? You must be prying and questioning!&rsquo; he angrily retorted. &lsquo;What
      more do you want to know?&rsquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;I want to know nothing, Jonas, but what you tell me. All hope of
      confidence between us has long deserted me!&rsquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Ecod, I should hope so!&rsquo; he muttered.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;But if you will tell me what you wish, I will be obedient and will try to
      please you. I make no merit of that, for I have no friend in my father or
      my sister, but am quite alone. I am very humble and submissive. You told
      me you would break my spirit, and you have done so. Do not break my heart
      too!&rsquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      She ventured, as she said these words, to lay her hand upon his shoulder.
      He suffered it to rest there, in his exultation; and the whole mean,
      abject, sordid, pitiful soul of the man, looked at her, for the moment,
      through his wicked eyes.
    </p>
    <p>
      For the moment only; for, with the same hurried return to something within
      himself, he bade her, in a surly tone, show her obedience by executing his
      commands without delay. When she had withdrawn he paced up and down the
      room several times; but always with his right hand clenched, as if it held
      something; which it did not, being empty. When he was tired of this, he
      threw himself into a chair, and thoughtfully turned up the sleeve of his
      right arm, as if he were rather musing about its strength than examining
      it; but, even then, he kept the hand clenched.
    </p>
    <p>
      He was brooding in this chair, with his eyes cast down upon the ground,
      when Mrs Gamp came in to tell him that the little room was ready. Not
      being quite sure of her reception after interfering in the quarrel, Mrs
      Gamp, as a means of interesting and propitiating her patron, affected a
      deep solicitude in Mr Chuffey.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;How is he now, sir?&rsquo; she said.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Who?&rsquo; cried Jonas, raising his head, and staring at her.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;To be sure!&rsquo; returned the matron with a smile and a curtsey. &lsquo;What am I
      thinking of! You wasn&rsquo;t here, sir, when he was took so strange. I never
      see a poor dear creetur took so strange in all my life, except a patient
      much about the same age, as I once nussed, which his calling was the
      custom-&rsquo;us, and his name was Mrs Harris&rsquo;s own father, as pleasant a
      singer, Mr Chuzzlewit, as ever you heerd, with a voice like a Jew&rsquo;s-harp
      in the bass notes, that it took six men to hold at sech times, foaming
      frightful.&rsquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Chuffey, eh?&rsquo; said Jonas carelessly, seeing that she went up to the old,
      clerk, and looked at him. &lsquo;Ha!&rsquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;The creetur&rsquo;s head&rsquo;s so hot,&rsquo; said Mrs Gamp, &lsquo;that you might heat a
      flat-iron at it. And no wonder I am sure, considerin&rsquo; the things he said!&rsquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Said!&rsquo; cried Jonas. &lsquo;What did he say?&rsquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      Mrs Gamp laid her hand upon her heart, to put some check upon its
      palpitations, and turning up her eyes replied in a faint voice:
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;The awfulest things, Mr Chuzzlewit, as ever I heerd! Which Mrs Harris&rsquo;s
      father never spoke a word when took so, some does and some don&rsquo;t, except
      sayin&rsquo; when he come round, &ldquo;Where is Sairey Gamp?&rdquo; But raly, sir, when Mr
      Chuffey comes to ask who&rsquo;s lyin&rsquo; dead upstairs, and&mdash;&rsquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Who&rsquo;s lying dead upstairs!&rsquo; repeated Jonas, standing aghast.
    </p>
    <p>
      Mrs Gamp nodded, made as if she were swallowing, and went on.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Who&rsquo;s lying dead upstairs; sech was his Bible language; and where was Mr
      Chuzzlewit as had the only son; and when he goes upstairs a-looking in the
      beds and wandering about the rooms, and comes down again a-whisperin&rsquo;
      softly to his-self about foul play and that; it gives me sech a turn, I
      don&rsquo;t deny it, Mr Chuzzlewit, that I never could have kep myself up but
      for a little drain o&rsquo; spirits, which I seldom touches, but could always
      wish to know where to find, if so dispoged, never knowin&rsquo; wot may happen
      next, the world bein&rsquo; so uncertain.&rsquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Why, the old fool&rsquo;s mad!&rsquo; cried Jonas, much disturbed.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;That&rsquo;s my opinion, sir,&rsquo; said Mrs Gamp, &lsquo;and I will not deceive you. I
      believe as Mr Chuffey, sir, rekwires attention (if I may make so bold),
      and should not have his liberty to wex and worrit your sweet lady as he
      does.&rsquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Why, who minds what he says?&rsquo; retorted Jonas.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Still he is worritin&rsquo; sir,&rsquo; said Mrs Gamp. &lsquo;No one don&rsquo;t mind him, but he
      <i>is</i> a ill conwenience.&rsquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Ecod you&rsquo;re right,&rsquo; said Jonas, looking doubtfully at the subject of this
      conversation. &lsquo;I have half a mind to shut him up.&rsquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      Mrs Gamp rubbed her hands, and smiled, and shook her head, and sniffed
      expressively, as scenting a job.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Could you&mdash;could you take care of such an idiot, now, in some spare
      room upstairs?&rsquo; asked Jonas.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Me and a friend of mine, one off, one on, could do it, Mr Chuzzlewit,&rsquo;
      replied the nurse; &lsquo;our charges not bein&rsquo; high, but wishin&rsquo; they was
      lower, and allowance made considerin&rsquo; not strangers. Me and Betsey Prig,
      sir, would undertake Mr Chuffey reasonable,&rsquo; said Mrs Gamp, looking at him
      with her head on one side, as if he had been a piece of goods, for which
      she was driving a bargain; &lsquo;and give every satigefaction. Betsey Prig has
      nussed a many lunacies, and well she knows their ways, which puttin&rsquo; &lsquo;em
      right close afore the fire, when fractious, is the certainest and most
      compoging.&rsquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      While Mrs Gamp discoursed to this effect, Jonas was walking up and down
      the room again, glancing covertly at the old clerk, as he did so. He now
      made a stop, and said:
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;I must look after him, I suppose, or I may have him doing some mischief.
      What say you?&rsquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Nothin&rsquo; more likely!&rsquo; Mrs Gamp replied. &lsquo;As well I have experienged, I do
      assure you, sir.&rsquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Well! Look after him for the present, and&mdash;let me see&mdash;three
      days from this time let the other woman come here, and we&rsquo;ll see if we can
      make a bargain of it. About nine or ten o&rsquo;clock at night, say. Keep your
      eye upon him in the meanwhile, and don&rsquo;t talk about it. He&rsquo;s as mad as a
      March hare!&rsquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Madder!&rsquo; cried Mrs Gamp. &lsquo;A deal madder!&rsquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;See to him, then; take care that he does no harm; and recollect what I
      have told you.&rsquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      Leaving Mrs Gamp in the act of repeating all she had been told, and of
      producing in support of her memory and trustworthiness, many commendations
      selected from among the most remarkable opinions of the celebrated Mrs
      Harris, he descended to the little room prepared for him, and pulling off
      his coat and his boots, put them outside the door before he locked it. In
      locking it, he was careful so to adjust the key as to baffle any curious
      person who might try to peep in through the key-hole; and when he had
      taken these precautions, he sat down to his supper.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Mr Chuff,&rsquo; he muttered, &lsquo;it&rsquo;ll be pretty easy to be even with <i>you</i>. It&rsquo;s
      of no use doing things by halves, and as long as I stop here, I&rsquo;ll take
      good care of you. When I&rsquo;m off you may say what you please. But it&rsquo;s a d&mdash;d
      strange thing,&rsquo; he added, pushing away his untouched plate, and striding
      moodily to and fro, &lsquo;that his drivellings should have taken this turn just
      now.&rsquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      After pacing the little room from end to end several times, he sat down in
      another chair.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;I say just now, but for anything I know, he may have been carrying on the
      same game all along. Old dog! He shall be gagged!&rsquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      He paced the room again in the same restless and unsteady way; and then
      sat down upon the bedstead, leaning his chin upon his hand, and looking at
      the table. When he had looked at it for a long time, he remembered his
      supper; and resuming the chair he had first occupied, began to eat with
      great rapacity; not like a hungry man, but as if he were determined to do
      it. He drank too, roundly; sometimes stopping in the middle of a draught
      to walk, and change his seat and walk again, and dart back to the table
      and fall to, in a ravenous hurry, as before.
    </p>
    <p>
      It was now growing dark. As the gloom of evening, deepening into night,
      came on, another dark shade emerging from within him seemed to overspread
      his face, and slowly change it. Slowly, slowly; darker and darker; more
      and more haggard; creeping over him by little and little, until it was
      black night within him and without.
    </p>
    <p>
      The room in which he had shut himself up, was on the ground floor, at the
      back of the house. It was lighted by a dirty skylight, and had a door in
      the wall, opening into a narrow covered passage or blind-alley, very
      little frequented after five or six o&rsquo;clock in the evening, and not in
      much use as a thoroughfare at any hour. But it had an outlet in a
      neighbouring street.
    </p>
    <p>
      The ground on which this chamber stood had, at one time, not within his
      recollection, been a yard; and had been converted to its present purpose
      for use as an office. But the occasion for it died with the man who built
      it; and saving that it had sometimes served as an apology for a spare
      bedroom, and that the old clerk had once held it (but that was years ago)
      as his recognized apartment, it had been little troubled by Anthony
      Chuzzlewit and Son. It was a blotched, stained, mouldering room, like a
      vault; and there were water-pipes running through it, which at unexpected
      times in the night, when other things were quiet, clicked and gurgled
      suddenly, as if they were choking.
    </p>
    <p>
      The door into the court had not been open for a long, long time; but the
      key had always hung in one place, and there it hung now. He was prepared
      for its being rusty; for he had a little bottle of oil in his pocket and
      the feather of a pen, with which he lubricated the key and the lock too,
      carefully. All this while he had been without his coat, and had nothing on
      his feet but his stockings. He now got softly into bed in the same state,
      and tossed from side to side to tumble it. In his restless condition that
      was easily done.
    </p>
    <p>
      When he arose, he took from his portmanteau, which he had caused to be
      carried into that place when he came home, a pair of clumsy shoes, and put
      them on his feet; also a pair of leather leggings, such as countrymen are
      used to wear, with straps to fasten them to the waistband. In these he
      dressed himself at leisure. Lastly, he took out a common frock of coarse
      dark jean, which he drew over his own under-clothing; and a felt hat&mdash;he
      had purposely left his own upstairs. He then sat himself down by the door,
      with the key in his hand, waiting.
    </p>
    <p>
      He had no light; the time was dreary, long, and awful. The ringers were
      practicing in a neighbouring church, and the clashing of the bells was
      almost maddening. Curse the clamouring bells, they seemed to know that he
      was listening at the door, and to proclaim it in a crowd of voices to all
      the town! Would they never be still?
    </p>
    <p>
      They ceased at last, and then the silence was so new and terrible that it
      seemed the prelude to some dreadful noise. Footsteps in the court! Two
      men. He fell back from the door on tiptoe, as if they could have seen him
      through its wooden panels.
    </p>
    <p>
      They passed on, talking (he could make out) about a skeleton which had
      been dug up yesterday, in some work of excavation near at hand, and was
      supposed to be that of a murdered man. &lsquo;So murder is not always found out,
      you see,&rsquo; they said to one another as they turned the corner.
    </p>
    <p>
      Hush!
    </p>
    <p>
      He put the key into the lock, and turned it. The door resisted for a
      while, but soon came stiffly open; mingling with the sense of fever in his
      mouth, a taste of rust, and dust, and earth, and rotting wood. He looked
      out; passed out; locked it after him.
    </p>
    <p>
      All was clear and quiet, as he fled away.

    <h3>
      CONCLUSION OF THE ENTERPRISE OF MR JONAS AND HIS FRIEND
    </h3>
    <p>
      Did no men passing through the dim streets shrink without knowing why,
      when he came stealing up behind them? As he glided on, had no child in its
      sleep an indistinct perception of a guilty shadow falling on its bed, that
      troubled its innocent rest? Did no dog howl, and strive to break its
      rattling chain, that it might tear him; no burrowing rat, scenting the
      work he had in hand, essay to gnaw a passage after him, that it might hold
      a greedy revel at the feast of his providing? When he looked back, across
      his shoulder, was it to see if his quick footsteps still fell dry upon the
      dusty pavement, or were already moist and clogged with the red mire that
      stained the naked feet of Cain!
    </p>
    <p>
      He shaped his course for the main western road, and soon reached it;
      riding a part of the way, then alighting and walking on again. He
      travelled for a considerable distance upon the roof of a stage-coach,
      which came up while he was afoot; and when it turned out of his road,
      bribed the driver of a return post-chaise to take him on with him; and
      then made across the country at a run, and saved a mile or two before he
      struck again into the road. At last, as his plan was, he came up with a
      certain lumbering, slow, night-coach, which stopped wherever it could, and
      was stopping then at a public-house, while the guard and coachman ate and
      drank within.
    </p>
    <p>
      He bargained for a seat outside this coach, and took it. And he quitted it
      no more until it was within a few miles of its destination, but occupied
      the same place all night.
    </p>
    <p>
      All night! It is a common fancy that nature seems to sleep by night. It is
      a false fancy, as who should know better than he?
    </p>
    <p>
      The fishes slumbered in the cold, bright, glistening streams and rivers,
      perhaps; and the birds roosted on the branches of the trees; and in their
      stalls and pastures beasts were quiet; and human creatures slept. But what
      of that, when the solemn night was watching, when it never winked, when
      its darkness watched no less than its light! The stately trees, the moon
      and shining stars, the softly stirring wind, the over-shadowed lane, the
      broad, bright countryside, they all kept watch. There was not a blade of
      growing grass or corn, but watched; and the quieter it was, the more
      intent and fixed its watch upon him seemed to be.
    </p>
    <p>
      And yet he slept. Riding on among those sentinels of God, he slept, and
      did not change the purpose of his journey. If he forgot it in his troubled
      dreams, it came up steadily, and woke him. But it never woke him to
      remorse, or to abandonment of his design.
    </p>
    <p>
      He dreamed at one time that he was lying calmly in his bed, thinking of a
      moonlight night and the noise of wheels, when the old clerk put his head
      in at the door, and beckoned him. At this signal he arose immediately&mdash;being
      already dressed in the clothes he actually wore at that time&mdash;and
      accompanied him into a strange city, where the names of the streets were
      written on the walls in characters quite new to him; which gave him no
      surprise or uneasiness, for he remembered in his dream to have been there
      before. Although these streets were very precipitous, insomuch that to get
      from one to another it was necessary to descend great heights by ladders
      that were too short, and ropes that moved deep bells, and swung and swayed
      as they were clung to, the danger gave him little emotion beyond the first
      thrill of terror; his anxieties being concentrated on his dress which was
      quite unfitted for some festival that was about to be holden there, and in
      which he had come to take a part. Already, great crowds began to fill the
      streets, and in one direction myriads of people came rushing down an
      interminable perspective, strewing flowers and making way for others on
      white horses, when a terrible figure started from the throng, and cried
      out that it was the Last Day for all the world. The cry being spread,
      there was a wild hurrying on to Judgment; and the press became so great
      that he and his companion (who was constantly changing, and was never the
      same man two minutes together, though he never saw one man come or another
      go), stood aside in a porch, fearfully surveying the multitude; in which
      there were many faces that he knew, and many that he did not know, but
      dreamed he did; when all at once a struggling head rose up among the rest&mdash;livid
      and deadly, but the same as he had known it&mdash;and denounced him as
      having appointed that direful day to happen. They closed together. As he
      strove to free the hand in which he held a club, and strike the blow he
      had so often thought of, he started to the knowledge of his waking purpose
      and the rising of the sun.
    </p>
    <p>
      The sun was welcome to him. There were life and motion, and a world astir,
      to divide the attention of Day. It was the eye of Night&mdash;of wakeful,
      watchful, silent, and attentive Night, with so much leisure for the
      observation of his wicked thoughts&mdash;that he dreaded most. There is no
      glare in the night. Even Glory shows to small advantage in the night, upon
      a crowded battle-field. How then shows Glory&rsquo;s blood-relation, bastard
      Murder!
    </p>
    <p>
      Aye! He made no compromise, and held no secret with himself now. Murder.
      He had come to do it.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Let me get down here&rsquo; he said
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Short of the town, eh!&rsquo; observed the coachman.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;I may get down where I please, I suppose?&rsquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;You got up to please yourself, and may get down to please yourself. It
      won&rsquo;t break our hearts to lose you, and it wouldn&rsquo;t have broken &lsquo;em if
      we&rsquo;d never found you. Be a little quicker. That&rsquo;s all.&rsquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      The guard had alighted, and was waiting in the road to take his money. In
      the jealousy and distrust of what he contemplated, he thought this man
      looked at him with more than common curiosity.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;What are you staring at?&rsquo; said Jonas.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Not at a handsome man,&rsquo; returned the guard. &lsquo;If you want your fortune
      told, I&rsquo;ll tell you a bit of it. You won&rsquo;t be drowned. That&rsquo;s a
      consolation for you.&rsquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      Before he could retort or turn away, the coachman put an end to the
      dialogue by giving him a cut with his whip, and bidding him get out for a
      surly dog. The guard jumped up to his seat at the same moment, and they
      drove off, laughing; leaving him to stand in the road and shake his fist
      at them. He was not displeased though, on second thoughts, to have been
      taken for an ill-conditioned common country fellow; but rather
      congratulated himself upon it as a proof that he was well disguised.
    </p>
    <p>
      Wandering into a copse by the road-side&mdash;but not in that place; two
      or three miles off&mdash;he tore out from a fence a thick, hard, knotted
      stake; and, sitting down beneath a hayrick, spent some time in shaping it,
      in peeling off the bark, and fashioning its jagged head with his knife.
    </p>
    <p>
      The day passed on. Noon, afternoon, evening. Sunset.
    </p>
    <p>
      At that serene and peaceful time two men, riding in a gig, came out of the
      city by a road not much frequented. It was the day on which Mr Pecksniff
      had agreed to dine with Montague. He had kept his appointment, and was now
      going home. His host was riding with him for a short distance; meaning to
      return by a pleasant track, which Mr Pecksniff had engaged to show him,
      through some fields. Jonas knew their plans. He had hung about the
      inn-yard while they were at dinner and had heard their orders given.
    </p>
    <p>
      They were loud and merry in their conversation, and might have been heard
      at some distance; far above the sound of their carriage wheels or horses&rsquo;
      hoofs. They came on noisily, to where a stile and footpath indicated their
      point of separation. Here they stopped.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;It&rsquo;s too soon. Much too soon,&rsquo; said Mr Pecksniff. &lsquo;But this is the place,
      my dear sir. Keep the path, and go straight through the little wood you&rsquo;ll
      come to. The path is narrower there, but you can&rsquo;t miss it. When shall I
      see you again? Soon I hope?&rsquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;I hope so,&rsquo; replied Montague.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Good night!&rsquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Good night. And a pleasant ride!&rsquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      So long as Mr Pecksniff was in sight, and turned his head at intervals to
      salute him, Montague stood in the road smiling, and waving his hand. But
      when his new partner had disappeared, and this show was no longer
      necessary, he sat down on the stile with looks so altered, that he might
      have grown ten years older in the meantime.
    </p>
    <p>
      He was flushed with wine, but not gay. His scheme had succeeded, but he
      showed no triumph. The effort of sustaining his difficult part before his
      late companion had fatigued him, perhaps, or it may be that the evening
      whispered to his conscience, or it may be (as it <i>has </i>been) that a shadowy
      veil was dropping round him, closing out all thoughts but the presentiment
      and vague foreknowledge of impending doom.
    </p>
    <p>
      If there be fluids, as we know there are, which, conscious of a coming
      wind, or rain, or frost, will shrink and strive to hide themselves in
      their glass arteries; may not that subtle liquor of the blood perceive, by
      properties within itself, that hands are raised to waste and spill it; and
      in the veins of men run cold and dull as his did, in that hour!
    </p>
    <p>
      So cold, although the air was warm; so dull, although the sky was bright;
      that he rose up shivering from his seat, and hastily resumed his walk. He
      checked himself as hastily; undecided whether to pursue the footpath,
      which was lonely and retired, or to go back by the road.
    </p>
    <p>
      He took the footpath.
    </p>
    <p>
      The glory of the departing sun was on his face. The music of the birds was
      in his ears. Sweet wild flowers bloomed about him. Thatched roofs of poor
      men&rsquo;s homes were in the distance; and an old grey spire, surmounted by a
      Cross, rose up between him and the coming night.
    </p>
    <p>
      He had never read the lesson which these things conveyed; he had ever
      mocked and turned away from it; but, before going down into a hollow
      place, he looked round, once, upon the evening prospect, sorrowfully. Then
      he went down, down, down, into the dell.
    </p>
    <p>
      It brought him to the wood; a close, thick, shadowy wood, through which
      the path went winding on, dwindling away into a slender sheep-track. He
      paused before entering; for the stillness of this spot almost daunted him.
    </p>
    <p>
      The last rays of the sun were shining in, aslant, making a path of golden
      light along the stems and branches in its range, which, even as he looked,
      began to die away, yielding gently to the twilight that came creeping on.
      It was so very quiet that the soft and stealthy moss about the trunks of
      some old trees, seemed to have grown out of the silence, and to be its
      proper offspring. Those other trees which were subdued by blasts of wind
      in winter time, had not quite tumbled down, but being caught by others,
      lay all bare and scathed across their leafy arms, as if unwilling to
      disturb the general repose by the crash of their fall. Vistas of silence
      opened everywhere, into the heart and innermost recesses of the wood;
      beginning with the likeness of an aisle, a cloister, or a ruin open to the
      sky; then tangling off into a deep green rustling mystery, through which
      gnarled trunks, and twisted boughs, and ivy-covered stems, and trembling
      leaves, and bark-stripped bodies of old trees stretched out at length,
      were faintly seen in beautiful confusion.
    </p>
    <p>
      As the sunlight died away, and evening fell upon the wood, he entered it.
      Moving, here and there a bramble or a drooping bough which stretched
      across his path, he slowly disappeared. At intervals a narrow opening
      showed him passing on, or the sharp cracking of some tender branch denoted
      where he went; then, he was seen or heard no more.
    </p>
    <p>
      Never more beheld by mortal eye or heard by mortal ear; one man excepted.
      That man, parting the leaves and branches on the other side, near where
      the path emerged again, came leaping out soon afterwards.
    </p>
    <p>
      What had he left within the wood, that he sprang out of it as if it were a
      hell!
    </p>
    <p>
      The body of a murdered man. In one thick solitary spot, it lay among the
      last year&rsquo;s leaves of oak and beech, just as it had fallen headlong down.
      Sopping and soaking in among the leaves that formed its pillow; oozing
      down into the boggy ground, as if to cover itself from human sight;
      forcing its way between and through the curling leaves, as if those
      senseless things rejected and forswore it and were coiled up in
      abhorrence; went a dark, dark stain that dyed the whole summer night from
      earth to heaven.
    </p>
    <p>
      The doer of this deed came leaping from the wood so fiercely, that he cast
      into the air a shower of fragments of young boughs, torn away in his
      passage, and fell with violence upon the grass. But he quickly gained his
      feet again, and keeping underneath a hedge with his body bent, went
      running on towards the road. The road once reached, he fell into a rapid
      walk, and set on toward London.
    </p>
    <p>
      And he was not sorry for what he had done. He was frightened when he
      thought of it&mdash;when did he not think of it!&mdash;but he was not
      sorry. He had had a terror and dread of the wood when he was in it; but
      being out of it, and having committed the crime, his fears were now
      diverted, strangely, to the dark room he had left shut up at home. He had
      a greater horror, infinitely greater, of that room than of the wood. Now
      that he was on his return to it, it seemed beyond comparison more dismal
      and more dreadful than the wood. His hideous secret was shut up in the
      room, and all its terrors were there; to his thinking it was not in the
      wood at all.
    </p>
    <p>
      He walked on for ten miles; and then stopped at an ale-house for a coach,
      which he knew would pass through, on its way to London, before long; and
      which he also knew was not the coach he had travelled down by, for it came
      from another place. He sat down outside the door here, on a bench, beside
      a man who was smoking his pipe. Having called for some beer, and drunk, he
      offered it to this companion, who thanked him, and took a draught. He
      could not help thinking that, if the man had known all, he might scarcely
      have relished drinking out of the same cup with him.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;A fine night, master!&rsquo; said this person. &lsquo;And a rare sunset.&rsquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;I didn&rsquo;t see it,&rsquo; was his hasty answer.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Didn&rsquo;t see it?&rsquo; returned the man.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;How the devil could I see it, if I was asleep?&rsquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Asleep! Aye, aye.&rsquo; The man appeared surprised by his unexpected
      irritability, and saying no more, smoked his pipe in silence. They had not
      sat very long, when there was a knocking within.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;What&rsquo;s that?&rsquo; cried Jonas.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Can&rsquo;t say, I&rsquo;m sure,&rsquo; replied the man.
    </p>
    <p>
      He made no further inquiry, for the last question had escaped him in spite
      of himself. But he was thinking, at the moment, of the closed-up room; of
      the possibility of their knocking at the door on some special occasion; of
      their being alarmed at receiving no answer; of their bursting it open; of
      their finding the room empty; of their fastening the door into the court,
      and rendering it impossible for him to get into the house without showing
      himself in the garb he wore, which would lead to rumour, rumour to
      detection, detection to death. At that instant, as if by some design and
      order of circumstances, the knocking had come.
    </p>
    <p>
      It still continued; like a warning echo of the dread reality he had
      conjured up. As he could not sit and hear it, he paid for his beer and
      walked on again. And having slunk about, in places unknown to him all day;
      and being out at night, in a lonely road, in an unusual dress and in that
      wandering and unsettled frame of mind; he stopped more than once to look
      about him, hoping he might be in a dream.
    </p>
    <p>
      Still he was not sorry. No. He had hated the man too much, and had been
      bent, too desperately and too long, on setting himself free. If the thing
      could have come over again, he would have done it again. His malignant and
      revengeful passions were not so easily laid. There was no more penitence
      or remorse within him now than there had been while the deed was brewing.
    </p>
    <p>
      Dread and fear were upon him, to an extent he had never counted on, and
      could not manage in the least degree. He was so horribly afraid of that
      infernal room at home. This made him, in a gloomy murderous, mad way, not
      only fearful <i>for </i>himself, but <i>of</i> himself; for being, as it were, a part of
      the room: a something supposed to be there, yet missing from it: he
      invested himself with its mysterious terrors; and when he pictured in his
      mind the ugly chamber, false and quiet, false and quiet, through the dark
      hours of two nights; and the tumbled bed, and he not in it, though
      believed to be; he became in a manner his own ghost and phantom, and was
      at once the haunting spirit and the haunted man.
    </p>
    <p>
      When the coach came up, which it soon did, he got a place outside and was
      carried briskly onward towards home. Now, in taking his seat among the
      people behind, who were chiefly country people, he conceived a fear that
      they knew of the murder, and would tell him that the body had been found;
      which, considering the time and place of the commission of the crime, were
      events almost impossible to have happened yet, as he very well knew. But
      although he did know it, and had therefore no reason to regard their
      ignorance as anything but the natural sequence to the facts, still this
      very ignorance of theirs encouraged him. So far encouraged him, that he
      began to believe the body never would be found, and began to speculate on
      that probability. Setting off from this point, and measuring time by the
      rapid hurry of his guilty thoughts, and what had gone before the
      bloodshed, and the troops of incoherent and disordered images of which he
      was the constant prey; he came by daylight to regard the murder as an old
      murder, and to think himself comparatively safe because it had not been
      discovered yet. Yet! When the sun which looked into the wood, and gilded
      with its rising light a dead man&rsquo;s lace, had seen that man alive, and
      sought to win him to a thought of Heaven, on its going down last night!
    </p>
    <p>
      But here were London streets again. Hush!
    </p>
    <p>
      It was but five o&rsquo;clock. He had time enough to reach his own house
      unobserved, and before there were many people in the streets, if nothing
      had happened so far, tending to his discovery. He slipped down from the
      coach without troubling the driver to stop his horses; and hurrying across
      the road, and in and out of every by-way that lay near his course, at
      length approached his own dwelling. He used additional caution in his
      immediate neighbourhood; halting first to look all down the street before
      him; then gliding swiftly through that one, and stopping to survey the
      next, and so on.
    </p>
    <p>
      The passage-way was empty when his murderer&rsquo;s face looked into it. He
      stole on, to the door on tiptoe, as if he dreaded to disturb his own
      imaginary rest.
    </p>
    <p>
      He listened. Not a sound. As he turned the key with a trembling hand, and
      pushed the door softly open with his knee, a monstrous fear beset his
      mind.
    </p>
    <p>
      What if the murdered man were there before him!
    </p>
    <p>
      He cast a fearful glance all round. But there was nothing there.
    </p>
    <p>
      He went in, locked the door, drew the key through and through the dust and
      damp in the fire-place to sully it again, and hung it up as of old. He
      took off his disguise, tied it up in a bundle ready for carrying away and
      sinking in the river before night, and locked it up in a cupboard. These
      precautions taken, he undressed and went to bed.
    </p>
    <p>
      The raging thirst, the fire that burnt within him as he lay beneath the
      clothes, the augmented horror of the room when they shut it out from his
      view; the agony of listening, in which he paid enforced regard to every
      sound, and thought the most unlikely one the prelude to that knocking
      which should bring the news; the starts with which he left his couch, and
      looking in the glass, imagined that his deed was broadly written in his
      face, and lying down and burying himself once more beneath the blankets,
      heard his own heart beating Murder, Murder, Murder, in the bed; what words
      can paint tremendous truths like these!
    </p>
    <p>
      The morning advanced. There were footsteps in the house. He heard the
      blinds drawn up, and shutters opened; and now and then a stealthy tread
      outside his own door. He tried to call out, more than once, but his mouth
      was dry as if it had been filled with sand. At last he sat up in his bed,
      and cried:
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Who&rsquo;s there?&rsquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      It was his wife.
    </p>
    <p>
      He asked her what it was o&rsquo;clock? Nine.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Did&mdash;did no one knock at my door yesterday?&rsquo; he faltered. &lsquo;Something
      disturbed me; but unless you had knocked the door down, you would have got
      no notice from me.&rsquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;No one,&rsquo; she replied. That was well. He had waited, almost breathless,
      for her answer. It was a relief to him, if anything could be.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Mr Nadgett wanted to see you,&rsquo; she said, &lsquo;but I told him you were tired,
      and had requested not to be disturbed. He said it was of little
      consequence, and went away. As I was opening my window to let in the cool
      air, I saw him passing through the street this morning, very early; but he
      hasn&rsquo;t been again.&rsquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      Passing through the street that morning? Very early! Jonas trembled at the
      thought of having had a narrow chance of seeing him himself; even him, who
      had no object but to avoid people, and sneak on unobserved, and keep his
      own secrets; and who saw nothing.
    </p>
    <p>
      He called to her to get his breakfast ready, and prepared to go upstairs;
      attiring himself in the clothes he had taken off when he came into that
      room, which had been, ever since, outside the door. In his secret dread of
      meeting the household for the first time, after what he had done, he
      lingered at the door on slight pretexts that they might see him without
      looking in his face; and left it ajar while he dressed; and called out to
      have the windows opened, and the pavement watered, that they might become
      accustomed to his voice. Even when he had put off the time, by one means
      or other, so that he had seen or spoken to them all, he could not muster
      courage for a long while to go in among them, but stood at his own door
      listening to the murmur of their distant conversation.
    </p>
    <p>
      He could not stop there for ever, and so joined them. His last glance at
      the glass had seen a tell-tale face, but that might have been because of
      his anxious looking in it. He dared not look at them to see if they
      observed him, but he thought them very silent.
    </p>
    <p>
      And whatsoever guard he kept upon himself, he could not help listening,
      and showing that he listened. Whether he attended to their talk, or tried
      to think of other things, or talked himself, or held his peace, or
      resolutely counted the dull tickings of a hoarse clock at his back, he
      always lapsed, as if a spell were on him, into eager listening. For he
      knew it must come. And his present punishment, and torture and
      distraction, were, to listen for its coming.
    </p>
    <p>
      Hush!

      CHAPTER FORTY-EIGHT
    </h2>
    <p>
      BEARS TIDINGS OF MARTIN AND OF MARK, AS WELL AS OF A THIRD PERSON NOT
      QUITE UNKNOWN TO THE READER. EXHIBITS FILIAL PIETY IN AN UGLY ASPECT; AND
      CASTS A DOUBTFUL RAY OF LIGHT UPON A VERY DARK PLACE
    </p>
    <p>
      Tom Pinch and Ruth were sitting at their early breakfast, with the window
      open, and a row of the freshest little plants ranged before it on the
      inside by Ruth&rsquo;s own hands; and Ruth had fastened a sprig of geranium in
      Tom&rsquo;s button-hole, to make him very smart and summer-like for the day (it
      was obliged to be fastened in, or that dear old Tom was certain to lose
      it); and people were crying flowers up and down the street; and a
      blundering bee, who had got himself in between the two sashes of the
      window, was bruising his head against the glass, endeavouring to force
      himself out into the fine morning, and considering himself enchanted
      because he couldn&rsquo;t do it; and the morning was as fine a morning as ever
      was seen; and the fragrant air was kissing Ruth and rustling about Tom, as
      if it said, &lsquo;how are you, my dears; I came all this way on purpose to
      salute you;&rsquo; and it was one of those glad times when we form, or ought to
      form, the wish that every one on earth were able to be happy, and catching
      glimpses of the summer of the heart, to feel the beauty of the summer of
      the year.
    </p>
    <p>
      It was even a pleasanter breakfast than usual; and it was always a
      pleasant one. For little Ruth had now two pupils to attend, each three
      times a week; and each two hours at a time; and besides this, she had
      painted some screens and card-racks, and, unknown to Tom (was there ever
      anything so delightful!), had walked into a certain shop which dealt in
      such articles, after often peeping through the window; and had taken
      courage to ask the Mistress of that shop whether she would buy them. And
      the mistress had not only bought them, but had ordered more, and that very
      morning Ruth had made confession of these facts to Tom, and had handed him
      the money in a little purse she had worked expressly for the purpose. They
      had been in a flutter about this, and perhaps had shed a happy tear or two
      for anything the history knows to the contrary; but it was all over now;
      and a brighter face than Tom&rsquo;s, or a brighter face than Ruth&rsquo;s, the bright
      sun had not looked on since he went to bed last night.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;My dear girl,&rsquo; said Tom, coming so abruptly on the subject, that he
      interrupted himself in the act of cutting a slice of bread, and left the
      knife sticking in the loaf, &lsquo;what a queer fellow our landlord is! I don&rsquo;t
      believe he has been home once since he got me into that unsatisfactory
      scrape. I begin to think he will never come home again. What a mysterious
      life that man does lead, to be sure!&rsquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Very strange. Is it not, Tom?&rsquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Really,&rsquo; said Tom, &lsquo;I hope it is only strange. I hope there may be
      nothing wrong in it. Sometimes I begin to be doubtful of that. I must have
      an explanation with him,&rsquo; said Tom, shaking his head as if this were a
      most tremendous threat, &lsquo;when I can catch him!&rsquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      A short double knock at the door put Tom&rsquo;s menacing looks to flight, and
      awakened an expression of surprise instead.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Heyday!&rsquo; said Tom. &lsquo;An early hour for visitors! It must be John, I
      suppose.&rsquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;I&mdash;I&mdash;don&rsquo;t think it was his knock, Tom,&rsquo; observed his little
      sister.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;No?&rsquo; said Tom. &lsquo;It surely can&rsquo;t be my employer suddenly arrived in town;
      directed here by Mr Fips; and come for the key of the office. It&rsquo;s
      somebody inquiring for me, I declare! Come in, if you please!&rsquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      But when the person came in, Tom Pinch, instead of saying, &lsquo;Did you wish
      to speak with me, sir?&rsquo; or, &lsquo;My name is Pinch, sir; what is your business,
      may I ask?&rsquo; or addressing him in any such distant terms; cried out, &lsquo;Good
      gracious Heaven!&rsquo; and seized him by both hands, with the liveliest
      manifestations of astonishment and pleasure.
    </p>
    <p>
      The visitor was not less moved than Tom himself, and they shook hands a
      great many times, without another word being spoken on either side. Tom
      was the first to find his voice.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Mark Tapley, too!&rsquo; said Tom, running towards the door, and shaking hands
      with somebody else. &lsquo;My dear Mark, come in. How are you, Mark? He don&rsquo;t
      look a day older than he used to do at the Dragon. How <i>are </i>you, Mark?&rsquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Uncommonly jolly, sir, thank&rsquo;ee,&rsquo; returned Mr Tapley, all smiles and
      bows. &lsquo;I hope I see you well, sir.&rsquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Good gracious me!&rsquo; cried Tom, patting him tenderly on the back. &lsquo;How
      delightful it is to hear his old voice again! My dear Martin, sit down. My
      sister, Martin. Mr Chuzzlewit, my love. Mark Tapley from the Dragon, my
      dear. Good gracious me, what a surprise this is! Sit down. Lord, bless
      me!&rsquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      Tom was in such a state of excitement that he couldn&rsquo;t keep himself still
      for a moment, but was constantly running between Mark and Martin, shaking
      hands with them alternately, and presenting them over and over again to
      his sister.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;I remember the day we parted, Martin, as well as if it were yesterday,&rsquo;
      said Tom. &lsquo;What a day it was! and what a passion you were in! And don&rsquo;t
      you remember my overtaking you in the road that morning, Mark, when I was
      going to Salisbury in the gig to fetch him, and you were looking out for a
      situation? And don&rsquo;t you recollect the dinner we had at Salisbury, Martin,
      with John Westlock, eh! Good gracious me! Ruth, my dear, Mr Chuzzlewit.
      Mark Tapley, my love, from the Dragon. More cups and saucers, if you
      please. Bless my soul, how glad I am to see you both!&rsquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      And then Tom (as John Westlock had done on his arrival) ran off to the
      loaf to cut some bread and butter for them; and before he had spread a
      single slice, remembered something else, and came running back again to
      tell it; and then he shook hands with them again; and then he introduced
      his sister again; and then he did everything he had done already all over
      again; and nothing Tom could do, and nothing Tom could say, was half
      sufficient to express his joy at their safe return.
    </p>
    <p>
      Mr Tapley was the first to resume his composure. In a very short space of
      time he was discovered to have somehow installed himself in office as
      waiter, or attendant upon the party; a fact which was first suggested to
      them by his temporary absence in the kitchen, and speedy return with a
      kettle of boiling water, from which he replenished the tea-pot with a
      self-possession that was quite his own.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Sit down, and take your breakfast, Mark,&rsquo; said Tom. &lsquo;Make him sit down
      and take his breakfast, Martin.&rsquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Oh! I gave him up, long ago, as incorrigible,&rsquo; Martin replied. &lsquo;He takes
      his own way, Tom. You would excuse him, Miss Pinch, if you knew his
      value.&rsquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;She knows it, bless you!&rsquo; said Tom. &lsquo;I have told her all about Mark
      Tapley. Have I not, Ruth?&rsquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Yes, Tom.&rsquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Not all,&rsquo; returned Martin, in a low voice. &lsquo;The best of Mark Tapley is
      only known to one man, Tom; and but for Mark he would hardly be alive to
      tell it!&rsquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Mark!&rsquo; said Tom Pinch energetically; &lsquo;if you don&rsquo;t sit down this minute,
      I&rsquo;ll swear at you!&rsquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Well, sir,&rsquo; returned Mr Tapley, &lsquo;sooner than you should do that, I&rsquo;ll
      com-ply. It&rsquo;s a considerable invasion of a man&rsquo;s jollity to be made so
      partickler welcome, but a Werb is a word as signifies to be, to do, or to
      suffer (which is all the grammar, and enough too, as ever I wos taught);
      and if there&rsquo;s a Werb alive, I&rsquo;m it. For I&rsquo;m always a-bein&rsquo;, sometimes
      a-doin&rsquo;, and continually a-sufferin&rsquo;.&rsquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Not jolly yet?&rsquo; asked Tom, with a smile.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Why, I was rather so, over the water, sir,&rsquo; returned Mr Tapley; &lsquo;and not
      entirely without credit. But Human Natur&rsquo; is in a conspiracy again&rsquo; me; I
      can&rsquo;t get on. I shall have to leave it in my will, sir, to be wrote upon
      my tomb: &ldquo;He was a man as might have come out strong if he could have got
      a chance. But it was denied him.&rdquo;&rsquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      Mr Tapley took this occasion of looking about him with a grin, and
      subsequently attacking the breakfast, with an appetite not at all
      expressive of blighted hopes, or insurmountable despondency.
    </p>
    <p>
      In the meanwhile, Martin drew his chair a little nearer to Tom and his
      sister, and related to them what had passed at Mr Pecksniff&rsquo;s house;
      adding in few words a general summary of the distresses and
      disappointments he had undergone since he left England.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;For your faithful stewardship in the trust I left with you, Tom,&rsquo; he
      said, &lsquo;and for all your goodness and disinterestedness, I can never thank
      you enough. When I add Mary&rsquo;s thanks to mine&mdash;&rsquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      Ah, Tom! The blood retreated from his cheeks, and came rushing back, so
      violently, that it was pain to feel it; ease though, ease, compared with
      the aching of his wounded heart.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;When I add Mary&rsquo;s thanks to mine,&rsquo; said Martin, &lsquo;I have made the only
      poor acknowledgment it is in our power to offer; but if you knew how much
      we feel, Tom, you would set some store by it, I am sure.&rsquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      And if they had known how much Tom felt&mdash;but that no human creature
      ever knew&mdash;they would have set some store by him. Indeed they would.
    </p>
    <p>
      Tom changed the topic of discourse. He was sorry he could not pursue it,
      as it gave Martin pleasure; but he was unable, at that moment. No drop of
      envy or bitterness was in his soul; but he could not master the firm
      utterance of her name.
    </p>
    <p>
      He inquired what Martin&rsquo;s projects were.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;No longer to make your fortune, Tom,&rsquo; said Martin, &lsquo;but to try to live. I
      tried that once in London, Tom; and failed. If you will give me the
      benefit of your advice and friendly counsel, I may succeed better under
      your guidance. I will do anything Tom, anything, to gain a livelihood by
      my own exertions. My hopes do not soar above that, now.&rsquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      High-hearted, noble Tom! Sorry to find the pride of his old companion
      humbled, and to hear him speaking in this altered strain at once, at once,
      he drove from his breast the inability to contend with its deep emotions,
      and spoke out bravely.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Your hopes do not soar above that!&rsquo; cried Tom. &lsquo;Yes they do. How can you
      talk so! They soar up to the time when you will be happy with her, Martin.
      They soar up to the time when you will be able to claim her, Martin. They
      soar up to the time when you will not be able to believe that you were
      ever cast down in spirit, or poor in pocket, Martin. Advice, and friendly
      counsel! Why, of course. But you shall have better advice and counsel
      (though you cannot have more friendly) than mine. You shall consult John
      Westlock. We&rsquo;ll go there immediately. It is yet so early that I shall have
      time to take you to his chambers before I go to business; they are in my
      way; and I can leave you there, to talk over your affairs with him. So
      come along. Come along. I am a man of occupation now, you know,&rsquo; said Tom,
      with his pleasantest smile; &lsquo;and have no time to lose. Your hopes don&rsquo;t
      soar higher than that? I dare say they don&rsquo;t. I know you, pretty well.
      They&rsquo;ll be soaring out of sight soon, Martin, and leaving all the rest of
      us leagues behind.&rsquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Aye! But I may be a little changed,&rsquo; said Martin, &lsquo;since you knew me
      pretty well, Tom.&rsquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;What nonsense!&rsquo; exclaimed Tom. &lsquo;Why should you be changed? You talk as if
      you were an old man. I never heard such a fellow! Come to John Westlock&rsquo;s,
      come. Come along, Mark Tapley. It&rsquo;s Mark&rsquo;s doing, I have no doubt; and it
      serves you right for having such a grumbler for your companion.&rsquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;There&rsquo;s no credit to be got through being jolly with <i>you</i>, Mr Pinch,
      anyways,&rsquo; said Mark, with his face all wrinkled up with grins. &lsquo;A parish
      doctor might be jolly with you. There&rsquo;s nothing short of goin&rsquo; to the
      U-nited States for a second trip, as would make it at all creditable to be
      jolly, arter seein&rsquo; you again!&rsquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      Tom laughed, and taking leave of his sister, hurried Mark and Martin out
      into the street, and away to John Westlock&rsquo;s by the nearest road; for his
      hour of business was very near at hand, and he prided himself on always
      being exact to his time.
    </p>
    <p>
      John Westlock was at home, but, strange to say, was rather embarrassed to
      see them; and when Tom was about to go into the room where he was
      breakfasting, said he had a stranger there. It appeared to be a mysterious
      stranger, for John shut that door as he said it, and led them into the
      next room.
    </p>
    <p>
      He was very much delighted, though, to see Mark Tapley; and received
      Martin with his own frank courtesy. But Martin felt that he did not
      inspire John Westlock with any unusual interest; and twice or thrice
      observed that he looked at Tom Pinch doubtfully; not to say
      compassionately. He thought, and blushed to think, that he knew the cause
      of this.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;I apprehend you are engaged,&rsquo; said Martin, when Tom had announced the
      purport of their visit. &lsquo;If you will allow me to come again at your own
      time, I shall be glad to do so.&rsquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;I <i>am</i> engaged,&rsquo; replied John, with some reluctance; &lsquo;but the matter on
      which I am engaged is one, to say the truth, more immediately demanding
      your knowledge than mine.&rsquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Indeed!&rsquo; cried Martin.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;It relates to a member of your family, and is of a serious nature. If you
      will have the kindness to remain here, it will be a satisfaction to me to
      have it privately communicated to you, in order that you may judge of its
      importance for yourself.&rsquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;And in the meantime,&rsquo; said Tom, &lsquo;I must really take myself off, without
      any further ceremony.&rsquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Is your business so very particular,&rsquo; asked Martin, &lsquo;that you cannot
      remain with us for half an hour? I wish you could. What <i>is</i> your business,
      Tom?&rsquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      It was Tom&rsquo;s turn to be embarrassed now; but he plainly said, after a
      little hesitation:
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Why, I am not at liberty to say what it is, Martin; though I hope soon to
      be in a condition to do so, and am aware of no other reason to prevent my
      doing so now, than the request of my employer. It&rsquo;s an awkward position to
      be placed in,&rsquo; said Tom, with an uneasy sense of seeming to doubt his
      friend, &lsquo;as I feel every day; but I really cannot help it, can I, John?&rsquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      John Westlock replied in the negative; and Martin, expressing himself
      perfectly satisfied, begged them not to say another word; though he could
      not help wondering very much what curious office Tom held, and why he was
      so secret, and embarrassed, and unlike himself, in reference to it. Nor
      could he help reverting to it, in his own mind, several times after Tom
      went away, which he did as soon as this conversation was ended, taking Mr
      Tapley with him, who, as he laughingly said, might accompany him as far as
      Fleet Street without injury.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;And what do you mean to do, Mark?&rsquo; asked Tom, as they walked on together.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Mean to do, sir?&rsquo; returned Mr Tapley.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Aye. What course of life do you mean to pursue?&rsquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Well, sir,&rsquo; said Mr Tapley. &lsquo;The fact is, that I have been a-thinking
      rather of the matrimonial line, sir.&rsquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;You don&rsquo;t say so, Mark!&rsquo; cried Tom.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Yes, sir. I&rsquo;ve been a-turnin&rsquo; of it over.&rsquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;And who is the lady, Mark?&rsquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;The which, sir?&rsquo; said Mr Tapley.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;The lady. Come! You know what I said,&rsquo; replied Tom, laughing, &lsquo;as well as
      I do!&rsquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      Mr Tapley suppressed his own inclination to laugh; and with one of his
      most whimsically-twisted looks, replied:
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;You couldn&rsquo;t guess, I suppose, Mr Pinch?&rsquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;How is it possible?&rsquo; said Tom. &lsquo;I don&rsquo;t know any of your flames, Mark.
      Except Mrs Lupin, indeed.&rsquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Well, sir!&rsquo; retorted Mr Tapley. &lsquo;And supposing it was her!&rsquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      Tom stopping in the street to look at him, Mr Tapley for a moment
      presented to his view an utterly stolid and expressionless face; a perfect
      dead wall of countenance. But opening window after window in it with
      astonishing rapidity, and lighting them all up as for a general
      illumination, he repeated:
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Supposin&rsquo;, for the sake of argument, as it was her, sir!&rsquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Why I thought such a connection wouldn&rsquo;t suit you, Mark, on any terms!&rsquo;
      cried Tom.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Well, sir! I used to think so myself, once,&rsquo; said Mark. &lsquo;But I ain&rsquo;t so
      clear about it now. A dear, sweet creetur, sir!&rsquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;A dear, sweet creature? To be sure she is,&rsquo; cried Tom. &lsquo;But she always
      was a dear, sweet creature, was she not?&rsquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;<i>Was </i>she not!&rsquo; assented Mr Tapley.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Then why on earth didn&rsquo;t you marry her at first, Mark, instead of
      wandering abroad, and losing all this time, and leaving her alone by
      herself, liable to be courted by other people?&rsquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Why, sir,&rsquo; retorted Mr Tapley, in a spirit of unbounded confidence, &lsquo;I&rsquo;ll
      tell you how it come about. You know me, Mr Pinch, sir; there ain&rsquo;t a
      gentleman alive as knows me better. You&rsquo;re acquainted with my
      constitution, and you&rsquo;re acquainted with my weakness. My constitution is,
      to be jolly; and my weakness is, to wish to find a credit in it. Wery
      good, sir. In this state of mind, I gets a notion in my head that she
      looks on me with a eye of&mdash;with what you may call a favourable sort
      of a eye in fact,&rsquo; said Mr Tapley, with modest hesitation.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;No doubt,&rsquo; replied Tom. &lsquo;We knew that perfectly well when we spoke on
      this subject long ago; before you left the Dragon.&rsquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      Mr Tapley nodded assent. &lsquo;Well, sir! But bein&rsquo; at that time full of
      hopeful wisions, I arrives at the conclusion that no credit is to be got
      out of such a way of life as that, where everything agreeable would be
      ready to one&rsquo;s hand. Lookin&rsquo; on the bright side of human life in short,
      one of my hopeful wisions is, that there&rsquo;s a deal of misery awaitin&rsquo; for
      me; in the midst of which I may come out tolerable strong, and be jolly
      under circumstances as reflects some credit. I goes into the world, sir,
      wery boyant, and I tries this. I goes aboard ship first, and wery soon
      discovers (by the ease with which I&rsquo;m jolly, mind you) as there&rsquo;s no
      credit to be got <i>there</i>. I might have took warning by this, and gave it up;
      but I didn&rsquo;t. I gets to the U-nited States; and then I <i>do</i> begin, I won&rsquo;t
      deny it, to feel some little credit in sustaining my spirits. What
      follows? Jest as I&rsquo;m a-beginning to come out, and am a-treadin&rsquo; on the
      werge, my master deceives me.&rsquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Deceives you!&rsquo; cried Tom.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Swindles me,&rsquo; retorted Mr Tapley with a beaming face. &lsquo;Turns his back on
      everything as made his service a creditable one, and leaves me high and
      dry, without a leg to stand upon. In which state I returns home. Wery
      good. Then all my hopeful wisions bein&rsquo; crushed; and findin&rsquo; that there
      ain&rsquo;t no credit for me nowhere; I abandons myself to despair, and says,
      &ldquo;Let me do that as has the least credit in it of all; marry a dear, sweet
      creetur, as is wery fond of me; me bein&rsquo;, at the same time, wery fond of
      her; lead a happy life, and struggle no more again&rsquo; the blight which
      settles on my prospects.&rdquo;&rsquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;If your philosophy, Mark,&rsquo; said Tom, who laughed heartily at this speech,
      &lsquo;be the oddest I ever heard of, it is not the least wise. Mrs Lupin has
      said &ldquo;yes,&rdquo; of course?&rsquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Why, no, sir,&rsquo; replied Mr Tapley; &lsquo;she hasn&rsquo;t gone so far as that yet.
      Which I attribute principally to my not havin&rsquo; asked her. But we was wery
      agreeable together&mdash;comfortable, I may say&mdash;the night I come
      home. It&rsquo;s all right, sir.&rsquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Well!&rsquo; said Tom, stopping at the Temple Gate. &lsquo;I wish you joy, Mark, with
      all my heart. I shall see you again to-day, I dare say. Good-bye for the
      present.&rsquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Good-bye, sir! Good-bye, Mr Pinch!&rsquo; he added by way of soliloquy, as he
      stood looking after him. &lsquo;Although you <i>are </i>a damper to a honourable
      ambition. You little think it, but you was the first to dash my hopes.
      Pecksniff would have built me up for life, but your sweet temper pulled me
      down. Good-bye, Mr Pinch!&rsquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      While these confidences were interchanged between Tom Pinch and Mark,
      Martin and John Westlock were very differently engaged. They were no
      sooner left alone together than Martin said, with an effort he could not
      disguise:
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Mr Westlock, we have met only once before, but you have known Tom a long
      while, and that seems to render you familiar to me. I cannot talk freely
      with you on any subject unless I relieve my mind of what oppresses it just
      now. I see with pain that you so far mistrust me that you think me likely
      to impose on Tom&rsquo;s regardlessness of himself, or on his kind nature, or
      some of his good qualities.&rsquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;I had no intention,&rsquo; replied John, &lsquo;of conveying any such impression to
      you, and am exceedingly sorry to have done so.&rsquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;But you entertain it?&rsquo; said Martin.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;You ask me so pointedly and directly,&rsquo; returned the other, &lsquo;that I cannot
      deny the having accustomed myself to regard you as one who, not in
      wantonness but in mere thoughtlessness of character, did not sufficiently
      consider his nature and did not quite treat it as it deserves to be
      treated. It is much easier to slight than to appreciate Tom Pinch.&rsquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      This was not said warmly, but was energetically spoken too; for there was
      no subject in the world (but one) on which the speaker felt so strongly.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;I grew into the knowledge of Tom,&rsquo; he pursued, &lsquo;as I grew towards
      manhood; and I have learned to love him as something, infinitely better
      than myself. I did not think that you understood him when we met before. I
      did not think that you greatly cared to understand him. The instances of
      this which I observed in you were, like my opportunities for observation,
      very trivial&mdash;and were very harmless, I dare say. But they were not
      agreeable to me, and they forced themselves upon me; for I was not upon
      the watch for them, believe me. You will say,&rsquo; added John, with a smile,
      as he subsided into more of his accustomed manner, &lsquo;that I am not by any
      means agreeable to you. I can only assure you, in reply, that I would not
      have originated this topic on any account.&rsquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;I originated it,&rsquo; said Martin; &lsquo;and so far from having any complaint to
      make against you, highly esteem the friendship you entertain for Tom, and
      the very many proofs you have given him of it. Why should I endeavour to
      conceal from you&rsquo;&mdash;he coloured deeply though&mdash;&lsquo;that I neither
      understood him nor cared to understand him when I was his companion; and
      that I am very truly sorry for it now!&rsquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      It was so sincerely said, at once so modestly and manfully, that John
      offered him his hand as if he had not done so before; and Martin giving
      his in the same open spirit, all constraint between the young men
      vanished.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Now pray,&rsquo; said John, &lsquo;when I tire your patience very much in what I am
      going to say, recollect that it has an end to it, and that the end is the
      point of the story.&rsquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      With this preface, he related all the circumstances connected with his
      having presided over the illness and slow recovery of the patient at the
      Bull; and tacked on to the skirts of that narrative Tom&rsquo;s own account of
      the business on the wharf. Martin was not a little puzzled when he came to
      an end, for the two stories seemed to have no connection with each other,
      and to leave him, as the phrase is, all abroad.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;If you will excuse me for one moment,&rsquo; said John, rising, &lsquo;I will beg you
      almost immediately to come into the next room.&rsquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      Upon that, he left Martin to himself, in a state of considerable
      astonishment; and soon came back again to fulfil his promise. Accompanying
      him into the next room, Martin found there a third person; no doubt the
      stranger of whom his host had spoken when Tom Pinch introduced him.
    </p>
    <p>
      He was a young man; with deep black hair and eyes. He was gaunt and pale;
      and evidently had not long recovered from a severe illness. He stood as
      Martin entered, but sat again at John&rsquo;s desire. His eyes were cast
      downward; and but for one glance at them both, half in humiliation and
      half in entreaty, he kept them so, and sat quite still and silent.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;This person&rsquo;s name is Lewsome,&rsquo; said John Westlock, &lsquo;whom I have
      mentioned to you as having been seized with an illness at the inn near
      here, and undergone so much. He has had a very hard time of it, ever since
      he began to recover; but, as you see, he is now doing well.&rsquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      As he did not move or speak, and John Westlock made a pause, Martin, not
      knowing what to say, said that he was glad to hear it.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;The short statement that I wish you to hear from his own lips, Mr
      Chuzzlewit,&rsquo; John pursued&mdash;looking attentively at him, and not at
      Martin&mdash;&lsquo;he made to me for the first time yesterday, and repeated to
      me this morning, without the least variation of any essential particular.
      I have already told you that he informed me before he was removed from the
      Inn, that he had a secret to disclose to me which lay heavy on his mind.
      But, fluctuating between sickness and health and between his desire to
      relieve himself of it, and his dread of involving himself by revealing it,
      he has, until yesterday, avoided the disclosure. I never pressed him for
      it (having no idea of its weight or import, or of my right to do so),
      until within a few days past; when, understanding from him, on his own
      voluntary avowal, in a letter from the country, that it related to a
      person whose name was Jonas Chuzzlewit; and thinking that it might throw
      some light on that little mystery which made Tom anxious now and then; I
      urged the point upon him, and heard his statement, as you will now, from
      his own lips. It is due to him to say, that in the apprehension of death,
      he committed it to writing sometime since, and folded it in a sealed
      paper, addressed to me; which he could not resolve, however, to place of
      his own act in my hands. He has the paper in his breast, I believe, at
      this moment.&rsquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      The young man touched it hastily; in corroboration of the fact.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;It will be well to leave that in our charge, perhaps,&rsquo; said John. &lsquo;But do
      not mind it now.&rsquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      As he said this, he held up his hand to bespeak Martin&rsquo;s attention. It was
      already fixed upon the man before him, who, after a short silence said, in
      a low, weak, hollow voice:
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;What relation was Mr Anthony Chuzzlewit, who&mdash;&rsquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;&mdash;Who died&mdash;to me?&rsquo; said Martin. &lsquo;He was my grandfather&rsquo;s
      brother.&rsquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;I fear he was made away with. Murdered!&rsquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;My God!&rsquo; said Martin. &lsquo;By whom?&rsquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      The young man, Lewsome, looked up in his face, and casting down his eyes
      again, replied:
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;I fear, by me.&rsquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;By you?&rsquo; cried Martin.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Not by my act, but I fear by my means.&rsquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Speak out!&rsquo; said Martin, &lsquo;and speak the truth.&rsquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;I fear this <i>is</i> the truth.&rsquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      Martin was about to interrupt him again, but John Westlock saying softly,
      &lsquo;Let him tell his story in his own way,&rsquo; Lewsome went on thus:
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;I have been bred a surgeon, and for the last few years have served a
      general practitioner in the City, as his assistant. While I was in his
      employment I became acquainted with Jonas Chuzzlewit. He is the principal
      in this deed.&rsquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;What do you mean?&rsquo; demanded Martin, sternly. &lsquo;Do you know he is the son
      of the old man of whom you have spoken?&rsquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;I do,&rsquo; he answered.
    </p>
    <p>
      He remained silent for some moments, when he resumed at the point where he
      had left off.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;I have reason to know it; for I have often heard him wish his old father
      dead, and complain of his being wearisome to him, and a drag upon him. He
      was in the habit of doing so, at a place of meeting we had&mdash;three or
      four of us&mdash;at night. There was no good in the place you may suppose,
      when you hear that he was the chief of the party. I wish I had died
      myself, and never seen it!&rsquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      He stopped again; and again resumed as before.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;We met to drink and game; not for large sums, but for sums that were
      large to us. He generally won. Whether or no, he lent money at interest to
      those who lost; and in this way, though I think we all secretly hated him,
      he came to be the master of us. To propitiate him we made a jest of his
      father; it began with his debtors; I was one; and we used to toast a
      quicker journey to the old man, and a swift inheritance to the young one.&rsquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      He paused again.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;One night he came there in a very bad humour. He had been greatly tried,
      he said, by the old man that day. He and I were alone together; and he
      angrily told me, that the old man was in his second childhood; that he was
      weak, imbecile, and drivelling; as unbearable to himself as he was to
      other people; and that it would be a charity to put him out of the way. He
      swore that he had often thought of mixing something with the stuff he took
      for his cough, which should help him to die easily. People were sometimes
      smothered who were bitten by mad dogs, he said; and why not help these
      lingering old men out of their troubles too? He looked full at me as he
      said so, and I looked full at him; but it went no farther that night.&rsquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      He stopped once more, and was silent for so long an interval that John
      Westlock said &lsquo;Go on.&rsquo; Martin had never removed his eyes from his face,
      but was so absorbed in horror and astonishment that he could not speak.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;It may have been a week after that, or it may have been less or more&mdash;the
      matter was in my mind all the time, but I cannot recollect the time, as I
      should any other period&mdash;when he spoke to me again. We were alone
      then, too; being there before the usual hour of assembling. There was no
      appointment between us; but I think I went there to meet him, and I know
      he came there to meet me. He was there first. He was reading a newspaper
      when I went in, and nodded to me without looking up, or leaving off
      reading. I sat down opposite and close to him. He said, immediately, that
      he wanted me to get him some of two sorts of drugs. One that was
      instantaneous in its effect; of which he wanted very little. One that was
      slow and not suspicious in appearance; of which he wanted more. While he
      was speaking to me he still read the newspaper. He said &ldquo;Drugs,&rdquo; and never
      used any other word. Neither did I.&rsquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;This all agrees with what I have heard before,&rsquo; observed John Westlock.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;I asked him what he wanted the drugs for? He said for no harm; to physic
      cats; what did it matter to me? I was going out to a distant colony (I had
      recently got the appointment, which, as Mr Westlock knows, I have since
      lost by my sickness, and which was my only hope of salvation from ruin),
      and what did it matter to me? He could get them without my aid at half a
      hundred places, but not so easily as he could get them of me. This was
      true. He might not want them at all, he said, and he had no present idea
      of using them; but he wished to have them by him. All this time he still
      read the newspaper. We talked about the price. He was to forgive me a
      small debt&mdash;I was quite in his power&mdash;and to pay me five pounds;
      and there the matter dropped, through others coming in. But, next night,
      under exactly similar circumstances, I gave him the drugs, on his saying I
      was a fool to think that he should ever use them for any harm; and he gave
      me the money. We have never met since. I only know that the poor old
      father died soon afterwards, just as he would have died from this cause;
      and that I have undergone, and suffer now, intolerable misery. Nothing&rsquo; he
      added, stretching out his hands, &lsquo;can paint my misery! It is well
      deserved, but nothing can paint it.&rsquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      With that he hung his head, and said no more, wasted and wretched, he was
      not a creature upon whom to heap reproaches that were unavailing.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Let him remain at hand,&rsquo; said Martin, turning from him; &lsquo;but out of
      sight, in Heaven&rsquo;s name!&rsquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;He will remain here,&rsquo; John whispered. &lsquo;Come with me!&rsquo; Softly turning the
      key upon him as they went out, he conducted Martin into the adjoining
      room, in which they had been before.
    </p>
    <p>
      Martin was so amazed, so shocked, and confounded by what he had heard that
      it was some time before he could reduce it to any order in his mind, or
      could sufficiently comprehend the bearing of one part upon another, to
      take in all the details at one view. When he, at length, had the whole
      narrative clearly before him, John Westlock went on to point out the great
      probability of the guilt of Jonas being known to other people, who traded
      in it for their own benefit, and who were, by such means, able to exert
      that control over him which Tom Pinch had accidentally witnessed, and
      unconsciously assisted. This appeared so plain, that they agreed upon it
      without difficulty; but instead of deriving the least assistance from this
      source, they found that it embarrassed them the more.
    </p>
    <p>
      They knew nothing of the real parties who possessed this power. The only
      person before them was Tom&rsquo;s landlord. They had no right to question Tom&rsquo;s
      landlord, even if they could find him, which, according to Tom&rsquo;s account,
      it would not be easy to do. And granting that they did question him, and
      he answered (which was taking a good deal for granted), he had only to
      say, with reference to the adventure on the wharf, that he had been sent
      from such and such a place to summon Jonas back on urgent business, and
      there was an end of it.
    </p>
    <p>
      Besides, there was the great difficulty and responsibility of moving at
      all in the matter. Lewsome&rsquo;s story might be false; in his wretched state
      it might be greatly heightened by a diseased brain; or admitting it to be
      entirely true, the old man might have died a natural death. Mr Pecksniff
      had been there at the time; as Tom immediately remembered, when he came
      back in the afternoon, and shared their counsels; and there had been no
      secrecy about it. Martin&rsquo;s grandfather was of right the person to decide
      upon the course that should be taken; but to get at his views would be
      impossible, for Mr Pecksniff&rsquo;s views were certain to be his. And the
      nature of Mr Pecksniff&rsquo;s views in reference to his own son-in-law might be
      easily reckoned upon.
    </p>
    <p>
      Apart from these considerations, Martin could not endure the thought of
      seeming to grasp at this unnatural charge against his relative, and using
      it as a stepping-stone to his grandfather&rsquo;s favour. But that he would seem
      to do so, if he presented himself before his grandfather in Mr Pecksniff&rsquo;s
      house again, for the purpose of declaring it; and that Mr Pecksniff, of
      all men, would represent his conduct in that despicable light, he
      perfectly well knew. On the other hand to be in possession of such a
      statement, and take no measures of further inquiry in reference to it, was
      tantamount to being a partner in the guilt it professed to disclose.
    </p>
    <p>
      In a word, they were wholly unable to discover any outlet from this maze
      of difficulty, which did not lie through some perplexed and entangled
      thicket. And although Mr Tapley was promptly taken into their confidence;
      and the fertile imagination of that gentleman suggested many bold
      expedients, which, to do him justice, he was quite ready to carry into
      instant operation on his own personal responsibility; still &lsquo;bating the
      general zeal of Mr Tapley&rsquo;s nature, nothing was made particularly clearer
      by these offers of service.
    </p>
    <p>
      It was in this position of affairs that Tom&rsquo;s account of the strange
      behaviour of the decayed clerk, on the night of the tea-party, became of
      great moment, and finally convinced them that to arrive at a more accurate
      knowledge of the workings of that old man&rsquo;s mind and memory, would be to
      take a most important stride in their pursuit of the truth. So, having
      first satisfied themselves that no communication had ever taken place
      between Lewsome and Mr Chuffey (which would have accounted at once for any
      suspicions the latter might entertain), they unanimously resolved that the
      old clerk was the man they wanted.
    </p>
    <p>
      But, like the unanimous resolution of a public meeting, which will
      oftentimes declare that this or that grievance is not to be borne a moment
      longer, which is nevertheless borne for a century or two afterwards,
      without any modification, they only reached in this the conclusion that
      they were all of one mind. For it was one thing to want Mr Chuffey, and
      another thing to get at him; and to do that without alarming him, or
      without alarming Jonas, or without being discomfited by the difficulty of
      striking, in an instrument so out of tune and so unused, the note they
      sought, was an end as far from their reach as ever.
    </p>
    <p>
      The question then became, who of those about the old clerk had had most
      influence with him that night? Tom said his young mistress clearly. But
      Tom and all of them shrunk from the thought of entrapping her, and making
      her the innocent means of bringing retribution on her cruel husband. Was
      there nobody else? Why yes. In a very different way, Tom said, he was
      influenced by Mrs Gamp, the nurse; who had once had the control of him, as
      he understood, for some time.
    </p>
    <p>
      They caught at this immediately. Here was a new way out, developed in a
      quarter until then overlooked. John Westlock knew Mrs Gamp; he had given
      her employment; he was acquainted with her place of residence: for that
      good lady had obligingly furnished him, at parting, with a pack of her
      professional cards for general distribution. It was decided that Mrs Gamp
      should be approached with caution, but approached without delay; and that
      the depths of that discreet matron&rsquo;s knowledge of Mr Chuffey, and means of
      bringing them, or one of them, into communication with him, should be
      carefully sounded.
    </p>
    <p>
      On this service, Martin and John Westlock determined to proceed that
      night; waiting on Mrs Gamp first, at her lodgings; and taking their chance
      of finding her in the repose of private life, or of having to seek her
      out, elsewhere, in the exercise of her professional duties. Tom returned
      home, that he might lose no opportunity of having an interview with
      Nadgett, by being absent in the event of his reappearance. And Mr Tapley
      remained (by his own particular desire) for the time being in Furnival&rsquo;s
      Inn, to look after Lewsome; who might safely have been left to himself,
      however, for any thought he seemed to entertain of giving them the slip.
    </p>
    <p>
      Before they parted on their several errands, they caused him to read
      aloud, in the presence of them all, the paper which he had about him, and
      the declaration he had attached to it, which was to the effect that he had
      written it voluntarily, in the fear of death and in the torture of his
      mind. And when he had done so, they all signed it, and taking it from him,
      of his free will, locked it in a place of safety.
    </p>
    <p>
      Martin also wrote, by John&rsquo;s advice, a letter to the trustees of the
      famous Grammar School, boldly claiming the successful design as his, and
      charging Mr Pecksniff with the fraud he had committed. In this proceeding
      also, John was hotly interested; observing, with his usual irreverance,
      that Mr Pecksniff had been a successful rascal all his life through, and
      that it would be a lasting source of happiness to him (John) if he could
      help to do him justice in the smallest particular.
    </p>
    <p>
      A busy day! But Martin had no lodgings yet; so when these matters were
      disposed of, he excused himself from dining with John Westlock and was
      fain to wander out alone, and look for some. He succeeded, after great
      trouble, in engaging two garrets for himself and Mark, situated in a court
      in the Strand, not far from Temple Bar. Their luggage, which was waiting
      for them at a coach-office, he conveyed to this new place of refuge; and
      it was with a glow of satisfaction, which as a selfish man he never could
      have known and never had, that, thinking how much pains and trouble he had
      saved Mark, and how pleased and astonished Mark would be, he afterwards
      walked up and down, in the Temple, eating a meat-pie for his dinner.

    <h2>
      CHAPTER FORTY-NINE
    </h2>
    <p>
      IN WHICH MRS HARRIS ASSISTED BY A TEAPOT, IS THE CAUSE OF A DIVISION
      BETWEEN FRIENDS
    </p>
    <p>
      Mrs Gamp&rsquo;s apartment in Kingsgate Street, High Holborn, wore,
      metaphorically speaking, a robe of state. It was swept and garnished for
      the reception of a visitor. That visitor was Betsey Prig; Mrs Prig, of
      Bartlemy&rsquo;s; or as some said Barklemy&rsquo;s, or as some said Bardlemy&rsquo;s; for by
      all these endearing and familiar appellations, had the hospital of Saint
      Bartholomew become a household word among the sisterhood which Betsey Prig
      adorned.
    </p>
    <p>
      Mrs Gamp&rsquo;s apartment was not a spacious one, but, to a contented mind, a
      closet is a palace; and the first-floor front at Mr Sweedlepipe&rsquo;s may have
      been, in the imagination of Mrs Gamp, a stately pile. If it were not
      exactly that, to restless intellects, it at least comprised as much
      accommodation as any person, not sanguine to insanity, could have looked
      for in a room of its dimensions. For only keep the bedstead always in your
      mind; and you were safe. That was the grand secret. Remembering the
      bedstead, you might even stoop to look under the little round table for
      anything you had dropped, without hurting yourself much against the chest
      of drawers, or qualifying as a patient of Saint Bartholomew, by falling
      into the fire.
    </p>
    <p>
      Visitors were much assisted in their cautious efforts to preserve an
      unflagging recollection of this piece of furniture, by its size; which was
      great. It was not a turn-up bedstead, nor yet a French bedstead, nor yet a
      four-post bedstead, but what is poetically called a tent; the sacking
      whereof was low and bulgy, insomuch that Mrs Gamp&rsquo;s box would not go under
      it, but stopped half-way, in a manner which, while it did violence to the
      reason, likewise endangered the legs of a stranger. The frame too, which
      would have supported the canopy and hangings if there had been any, was
      ornamented with divers pippins carved in timber, which on the slightest
      provocation, and frequently on none at all, came tumbling down; harassing
      the peaceful guest with inexplicable terrors.
    </p>
    <p>
      The bed itself was decorated with a patchwork quilt of great antiquity;
      and at the upper end, upon the side nearest to the door, hung a scanty
      curtain of blue check, which prevented the Zephyrs that were abroad in
      Kingsgate Street, from visiting Mrs Gamp&rsquo;s head too roughly. Some rusty
      gowns and other articles of that lady&rsquo;s wardrobe depended from the posts;
      and these had so adapted themselves by long usage to her figure, that more
      than one impatient husband coming in precipitately, at about the time of
      twilight, had been for an instant stricken dumb by the supposed discovery
      that Mrs Gamp had hanged herself. One gentleman, coming on the usual hasty
      errand, had said indeed, that they looked like guardian angels &lsquo;watching
      of her in her sleep.&rsquo; But that, as Mrs Gamp said, &lsquo;was his first;&rsquo; and he
      never repeated the sentiment, though he often repeated his visit.
    </p>
    <p>
      The chairs in Mrs Gamp&rsquo;s apartment were extremely large and broad-backed,
      which was more than a sufficient reason for there being but two in number.
      They were both elbow-chairs, of ancient mahogany; and were chiefly
      valuable for the slippery nature of their seats, which had been originally
      horsehair, but were now covered with a shiny substance of a bluish tint,
      from which the visitor began to slide away with a dismayed countenance,
      immediately after sitting down. What Mrs Gamp wanted in chairs she made up
      in bandboxes; of which she had a great collection, devoted to the
      reception of various miscellaneous valuables, which were not, however, as
      well protected as the good woman, by a pleasant fiction, seemed to think;
      for, though every bandbox had a carefully closed lid, not one among them
      had a bottom; owing to which cause the property within was merely, as it
      were, extinguished. The chest of drawers having been originally made to
      stand upon the top of another chest, had a dwarfish, elfin look, alone;
      but in regard of its security it had a great advantage over the bandboxes,
      for as all the handles had been long ago pulled off, it was very difficult
      to get at its contents. This indeed was only to be done by one or two
      devices; either by tilting the whole structure forward until all the
      drawers fell out together, or by opening them singly with knives, like
      oysters.
    </p>
    <p>
      Mrs Gamp stored all her household matters in a little cupboard by the
      fire-place; beginning below the surface (as in nature) with the coals, and
      mounting gradually upwards to the spirits, which, from motives of
      delicacy, she kept in a teapot. The chimney-piece was ornamented with a
      small almanack, marked here and there in Mrs Gamp&rsquo;s own hand with a
      memorandum of the date at which some lady was expected to fall due. It was
      also embellished with three profiles: one, in colours, of Mrs Gamp herself
      in early life; one, in bronze, of a lady in feathers, supposed to be Mrs
      Harris, as she appeared when dressed for a ball; and one, in black, of Mr
      Gamp, deceased. The last was a full length, in order that the likeness
      might be rendered more obvious and forcible by the introduction of the
      wooden leg.
    </p>
    <p>
      A pair of bellows, a pair of pattens, a toasting-fork, a kettle, a
      pap-boat, a spoon for the administration of medicine to the refractory,
      and lastly, Mrs Gamp&rsquo;s umbrella, which as something of great price and
      rarity, was displayed with particular ostentation, completed the
      decorations of the chimney-piece and adjacent wall. Towards these objects
      Mrs Gamp raised her eyes in satisfaction when she had arranged the
      tea-board, and had concluded her arrangements for the reception of Betsey
      Prig, even unto the setting forth of two pounds of Newcastle salmon,
      intensely pickled.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;There! Now drat you, Betsey, don&rsquo;t be long!&rsquo; said Mrs Gamp,
      apostrophizing her absent friend. &lsquo;For I can&rsquo;t abear to wait, I do assure
      you. To wotever place I goes, I sticks to this one mortar, &ldquo;I&rsquo;m easy
      pleased; it is but little as I wants; but I must have that little of the
      best, and to the minute when the clock strikes, else we do not part as I
      could wish, but bearin&rsquo; malice in our arts.&rdquo;&rsquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      Her own preparations were of the best, for they comprehended a delicate
      new loaf, a plate of fresh butter, a basin of fine white sugar, and other
      arrangements on the same scale. Even the snuff with which she now
      refreshed herself, was so choice in quality that she took a second pinch.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;There&rsquo;s the little bell a-ringing now,&rsquo; said Mrs Gamp, hurrying to the
      stair-head and looking over. &lsquo;Betsey Prig, my&mdash;why it&rsquo;s that there
      disapintin&rsquo; Sweedlepipes, I do believe.&rsquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Yes, it&rsquo;s me,&rsquo; said the barber in a faint voice; &lsquo;I&rsquo;ve just come in.&rsquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;You&rsquo;re always a-comin&rsquo; in, I think,&rsquo; muttered Mrs Gamp to herself,
      &lsquo;except wen you&rsquo;re a-goin&rsquo; out. I ha&rsquo;n&rsquo;t no patience with that man!&rsquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Mrs Gamp,&rsquo; said the barber. &lsquo;I say! Mrs Gamp!&rsquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Well,&rsquo; cried Mrs Gamp, impatiently, as she descended the stairs. &lsquo;What is
      it? Is the Thames a-fire, and cooking its own fish, Mr Sweedlepipes? Why
      wot&rsquo;s the man gone and been a-doin&rsquo; of to himself? He&rsquo;s as white as
      chalk!&rsquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      She added the latter clause of inquiry, when she got downstairs, and found
      him seated in the shaving-chair, pale and disconsolate.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;You recollect,&rsquo; said Poll. &lsquo;You recollect young&mdash;&rsquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Not young Wilkins!&rsquo; cried Mrs Gamp. &lsquo;Don&rsquo;t say young Wilkins, wotever you
      do. If young Wilkins&rsquo;s wife is took&mdash;&rsquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;It isn&rsquo;t anybody&rsquo;s wife,&rsquo; exclaimed the little barber. &lsquo;Bailey, young
      Bailey!&rsquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Why, wot do you mean to say that chit&rsquo;s been a-doin&rsquo; of?&rsquo; retorted Mrs
      Gamp, sharply. &lsquo;Stuff and nonsense, Mrs Sweedlepipes!&rsquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;He hasn&rsquo;t been a-doing anything!&rsquo; exclaimed poor Poll, quite desperate.
      &lsquo;What do you catch me up so short for, when you see me put out to that
      extent that I can hardly speak? He&rsquo;ll never do anything again. He&rsquo;s done
      for. He&rsquo;s killed. The first time I ever see that boy,&rsquo; said Poll, &lsquo;I
      charged him too much for a red-poll. I asked him three-halfpence for a
      penny one, because I was afraid he&rsquo;d beat me down. But he didn&rsquo;t. And now
      he&rsquo;s dead; and if you was to crowd all the steam-engines and electric
      fluids that ever was, into this shop, and set &lsquo;em every one to work their
      hardest, they couldn&rsquo;t square the account, though it&rsquo;s only a ha&rsquo;penny!&rsquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      Mr Sweedlepipe turned aside to the towel, and wiped his eyes with it.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;And what a clever boy he was!&rsquo; he said. &lsquo;What a surprising young chap he
      was! How he talked! and what a deal he know&rsquo;d! Shaved in this very chair
      he was; only for fun; it was all his fun; he was full of it. Ah! to think
      that he&rsquo;ll never be shaved in earnest! The birds might every one have
      died, and welcome,&rsquo; cried the little barber, looking round him at the
      cages, and again applying to the towel, &lsquo;sooner than I&rsquo;d have heard this
      news!&rsquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;How did you ever come to hear it?&rsquo; said Mrs Gamp, &lsquo;who told you?&rsquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;I went out,&rsquo; returned the little barber, &lsquo;into the City, to meet a
      sporting gent upon the Stock Exchange, that wanted a few slow pigeons to
      practice at; and when I&rsquo;d done with him, I went to get a little drop of
      beer, and there I heard everybody a-talking about it. It&rsquo;s in the papers.&rsquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;You are in a nice state of confugion, Mr Sweedlepipes, you are!&rsquo; said Mrs
      Gamp, shaking her head; &lsquo;and my opinion is, as half-a-dudgeon fresh young
      lively leeches on your temples, wouldn&rsquo;t be too much to clear your mind,
      which so I tell you. Wot were they a-talkin&rsquo; on, and wot was in the
      papers?&rsquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;All about it!&rsquo; cried the barber. &lsquo;What else do you suppose? Him and his
      master were upset on a journey, and he was carried to Salisbury, and was
      breathing his last when the account came away. He never spoke afterwards.
      Not a single word. That&rsquo;s the worst of it to me; but that ain&rsquo;t all. His
      master can&rsquo;t be found. The other manager of their office in the city,
      Crimple, David Crimple, has gone off with the money, and is advertised
      for, with a reward, upon the walls. Mr Montague, poor young Bailey&rsquo;s
      master (what a boy he was!) is advertised for, too. Some say he&rsquo;s slipped
      off, to join his friend abroad; some say he mayn&rsquo;t have got away yet; and
      they&rsquo;re looking for him high and low. Their office is a smash; a swindle
      altogether. But what&rsquo;s a Life Assurance office to a Life! And what a Life
      Young Bailey&rsquo;s was!&rsquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;He was born into a wale,&rsquo; said Mrs Gamp, with philosophical coolness.
      &lsquo;and he lived in a wale; and he must take the consequences of sech a
      sitiwation. But don&rsquo;t you hear nothink of Mr Chuzzlewit in all this?&rsquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;No,&rsquo; said Poll, &lsquo;nothing to speak of. His name wasn&rsquo;t printed as one of
      the board, though some people say it was just going to be. Some believe he
      was took in, and some believe he was one of the takers-in; but however
      that may be, they can&rsquo;t prove nothing against him. This morning he went up
      of his own accord afore the Lord Mayor or some of them City big-wigs, and
      complained that he&rsquo;d been swindled, and that these two persons had gone
      off and cheated him, and that he had just found out that Montague&rsquo;s name
      wasn&rsquo;t even Montague, but something else. And they do say that he looked
      like Death, owing to his losses. But, Lord forgive me,&rsquo; cried the barber,
      coming back again to the subject of his individual grief, &lsquo;what&rsquo;s his
      looks to me! He might have died and welcome, fifty times, and not been
      such a loss as Bailey!&rsquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      At this juncture the little bell rang, and the deep voice of Mrs Prig
      struck into the conversation.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Oh! You&rsquo;re a-talkin&rsquo; about it, are you!&rsquo; observed that lady. &lsquo;Well, I
      hope you&rsquo;ve got it over, for I ain&rsquo;t interested in it myself.&rsquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;My precious Betsey,&rsquo; said Mrs Gamp, &lsquo;how late you are!&rsquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      The worthy Mrs Prig replied, with some asperity, &lsquo;that if perwerse people
      went off dead, when they was least expected, it warn&rsquo;t no fault of her&rsquo;n.&rsquo;
      And further, &lsquo;that it was quite aggrawation enough to be made late when
      one was dropping for one&rsquo;s tea, without hearing on it again.&rsquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      Mrs Gamp, deriving from this exhibition of repartee some clue to the state
      of Mrs Prig&rsquo;s feelings, instantly conducted her upstairs; deeming that the
      sight of pickled salmon might work a softening change.
    </p>
    <p>
      But Betsey Prig expected pickled salmon. It was obvious that she did; for
      her first words, after glancing at the table, were:
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;I know&rsquo;d she wouldn&rsquo;t have a cowcumber!&rsquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      Mrs Gamp changed colour, and sat down upon the bedstead.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Lord bless you, Betsey Prig, your words is true. I quite forgot it!&rsquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      Mrs Prig, looking steadfastly at her friend, put her hand in her pocket,
      and with an air of surly triumph drew forth either the oldest of lettuces
      or youngest of cabbages, but at any rate, a green vegetable of an
      expansive nature, and of such magnificent proportions that she was obliged
      to shut it up like an umbrella before she could pull it out. She also
      produced a handful of mustard and cress, a trifle of the herb called
      dandelion, three bunches of radishes, an onion rather larger than an
      average turnip, three substantial slices of beetroot, and a short prong or
      antler of celery; the whole of this garden-stuff having been publicly
      exhibited, but a short time before, as a twopenny salad, and purchased by
      Mrs Prig on condition that the vendor could get it all into her pocket.
      Which had been happily accomplished, in High Holborn, to the breathless
      interest of a hackney-coach stand. And she laid so little stress on this
      surprising forethought, that she did not even smile, but returning her
      pocket into its accustomed sphere, merely recommended that these
      productions of nature should be sliced up, for immediate consumption, in
      plenty of vinegar.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;And don&rsquo;t go a-droppin&rsquo; none of your snuff in it,&rsquo; said Mrs Prig. &lsquo;In
      gruel, barley-water, apple-tea, mutton-broth, and that, it don&rsquo;t signify.
      It stimulates a patient. But I don&rsquo;t relish it myself.&rsquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Why, Betsey Prig!&rsquo; cried Mrs Gamp, &lsquo;how <i>can </i>you talk so!&rsquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Why, ain&rsquo;t your patients, wotever their diseases is, always asneezin&rsquo;
      their wery heads off, along of your snuff?&rsquo; said Mrs Prig.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;And wot if they are!&rsquo; said Mrs Gamp
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Nothing if they are,&rsquo; said Mrs Prig. &lsquo;But don&rsquo;t deny it, Sairah.&rsquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Who deniges of it?&rsquo; Mrs Gamp inquired.
    </p>
    <p>
      Mrs Prig returned no answer.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;<i>Who </i>deniges of it, Betsey?&rsquo; Mrs Gamp inquired again. Then Mrs Gamp, by
      reversing the question, imparted a deeper and more awful character of
      solemnity to the same. &lsquo;Betsey, who deniges of it?&rsquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      It was the nearest possible approach to a very decided difference of
      opinion between these ladies; but Mrs Prig&rsquo;s impatience for the meal being
      greater at the moment than her impatience of contradiction, she replied,
      for the present, &lsquo;Nobody, if you don&rsquo;t, Sairah,&rsquo; and prepared herself for
      tea. For a quarrel can be taken up at any time, but a limited quantity of
      salmon cannot.
    </p>
    <p>
      Her toilet was simple. She had merely to &lsquo;chuck&rsquo; her bonnet and shawl upon
      the bed; give her hair two pulls, one upon the right side and one upon the
      left, as if she were ringing a couple of bells; and all was done. The tea
      was already made, Mrs Gamp was not long over the salad, and they were soon
      at the height of their repast.
    </p>
    <p>
      The temper of both parties was improved, for the time being, by the
      enjoyments of the table. When the meal came to a termination (which it was
      pretty long in doing), and Mrs Gamp having cleared away, produced the
      teapot from the top shelf, simultaneously with a couple of wine-glasses,
      they were quite amiable.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Betsey,&rsquo; said Mrs Gamp, filling her own glass and passing the teapot, &lsquo;I
      will now propoge a toast. My frequent pardner, Betsey Prig!&rsquo;
    </p>

    </h5>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Which, altering the name to Sairah Gamp; I drink,&rsquo; said Mrs Prig, &lsquo;with
      love and tenderness.&rsquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      From this moment symptoms of inflammation began to lurk in the nose of
      each lady; and perhaps, notwithstanding all appearances to the contrary,
      in the temper also.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Now, Sairah,&rsquo; said Mrs Prig, &lsquo;joining business with pleasure, wot is this
      case in which you wants me?&rsquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      Mrs Gamp betraying in her face some intention of returning an evasive
      answer, Betsey added:
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;<i>Is</i> it Mrs Harris?&rsquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;No, Betsey Prig, it ain&rsquo;t,&rsquo; was Mrs Gamp&rsquo;s reply.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Well!&rsquo; said Mrs Prig, with a short laugh. &lsquo;I&rsquo;m glad of that, at any
      rate.&rsquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Why should you be glad of that, Betsey?&rsquo; Mrs Gamp retorted, warmly. &lsquo;She
      is unbeknown to you except by hearsay, why should you be glad? If you have
      anythink to say contrairy to the character of Mrs Harris, which well I
      knows behind her back, afore her face, or anywheres, is not to be
      impeaged, out with it, Betsey. I have know&rsquo;d that sweetest and best of
      women,&rsquo; said Mrs Gamp, shaking her head, and shedding tears, &lsquo;ever since
      afore her First, which Mr Harris who was dreadful timid went and stopped
      his ears in a empty dog-kennel, and never took his hands away or come out
      once till he was showed the baby, wen bein&rsquo; took with fits, the doctor
      collared him and laid him on his back upon the airy stones, and she was
      told to ease her mind, his owls was organs. And I have know&rsquo;d her, Betsey
      Prig, when he has hurt her feelin&rsquo; art by sayin&rsquo; of his Ninth that it was
      one too many, if not two, while that dear innocent was cooin&rsquo; in his face,
      which thrive it did though bandy, but I have never know&rsquo;d as you had
      occagion to be glad, Betsey, on accounts of Mrs Harris not requiring you.
      Require she never will, depend upon it, for her constant words in sickness
      is, and will be, &ldquo;Send for Sairey?&rdquo;&rsquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      During this touching address, Mrs Prig adroitly feigning to be the victim
      of that absence of mind which has its origin in excessive attention to one
      topic, helped herself from the teapot without appearing to observe it. Mrs
      Gamp observed it, however, and came to a premature close in consequence.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Well, it ain&rsquo;t her, it seems,&rsquo; said Mrs Prig, coldly; &lsquo;who is it then?&rsquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;You have heerd me mention, Betsey,&rsquo; Mrs Gamp replied, after glancing in
      an expressive and marked manner at the tea-pot, &lsquo;a person as I took care
      on at the time as you and me was pardners off and on, in that there fever
      at the Bull?&rsquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Old Snuffey,&rsquo; Mrs Prig observed.
    </p>
    <p>
      Sarah Gamp looked at her with an eye of fire, for she saw in this mistake
      of Mrs Prig, another willful and malignant stab at that same weakness or
      custom of hers, an ungenerous allusion to which, on the part of Betsey,
      had first disturbed their harmony that evening. And she saw it still more
      clearly, when, politely but firmly correcting that lady by the distinct
      enunciation of the word &lsquo;Chuffey,&rsquo; Mrs Prig received the correction with a
      diabolical laugh.
    </p>
    <p>
      The best among us have their failings, and it must be conceded of Mrs
      Prig, that if there were a blemish in the goodness of her disposition, it
      was a habit she had of not bestowing all its sharp and acid properties
      upon her patients (as a thoroughly amiable woman would have done), but of
      keeping a considerable remainder for the service of her friends. Highly
      pickled salmon, and lettuces chopped up in vinegar, may, as viands
      possessing some acidity of their own, have encouraged and increased this
      failing in Mrs Prig; and every application to the teapot certainly did;
      for it was often remarked of her by her friends, that she was most
      contradictory when most elevated. It is certain that her countenance
      became about this time derisive and defiant, and that she sat with her
      arms folded, and one eye shut up, in a somewhat offensive, because
      obstrusively intelligent, manner.
    </p>
    <p>
      Mrs Gamp observing this, felt it the more necessary that Mrs Prig should
      know her place, and be made sensible of her exact station in society, as
      well as of her obligations to herself. She therefore assumed an air of
      greater patronage and importance, as she went on to answer Mrs Prig a
      little more in detail.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Mr Chuffey, Betsey,&rsquo; said Mrs Gamp, &lsquo;is weak in his mind. Excuge me if I
      makes remark, that he may neither be so weak as people thinks, nor people
      may not think he is so weak as they pretends, and what I knows, I knows;
      and what you don&rsquo;t, you don&rsquo;t; so do not ask me, Betsey. But Mr Chuffey&rsquo;s
      friends has made propojals for his bein&rsquo; took care on, and has said to me,
      &ldquo;Mrs Gamp, <i>will </i>you undertake it? We couldn&rsquo;t think,&rdquo; they says, &ldquo;of
      trusting him to nobody but you, for, Sairey, you are gold as has passed
      the furnage. Will you undertake it, at your own price, day and night, and
      by your own self?&rdquo; &ldquo;No,&rdquo; I says, &ldquo;I will not. Do not reckon on it. There
      is,&rdquo; I says, &ldquo;but one creetur in the world as I would undertake on sech
      terms, and her name is Harris. But,&rdquo; I says, &ldquo;I am acquainted with a
      friend, whose name is Betsey Prig, that I can recommend, and will assist
      me. Betsey,&rdquo; I says, &ldquo;is always to be trusted under me, and will be guided
      as I could desire.&rdquo;&rsquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      Here Mrs Prig, without any abatement of her offensive manner again
      counterfeited abstraction of mind, and stretched out her hand to the
      teapot. It was more than Mrs Gamp could bear. She stopped the hand of Mrs
      Prig with her own, and said, with great feeling:
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;No, Betsey! Drink fair, wotever you do!&rsquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      Mrs Prig, thus baffled, threw herself back in her chair, and closing the
      same eye more emphatically, and folding her arms tighter, suffered her
      head to roll slowly from side to side, while she surveyed her friend with
      a contemptuous smile.
    </p>
    <p>
      Mrs Gamp resumed:
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Mrs Harris, Betsey&mdash;&rsquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Bother Mrs Harris!&rsquo; said Betsey Prig.
    </p>
    <p>
      Mrs Gamp looked at her with amazement, incredulity, and indignation; when
      Mrs Prig, shutting her eye still closer, and folding her arms still
      tighter, uttered these memorable and tremendous words:
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;I don&rsquo;t believe there&rsquo;s no sich a person!&rsquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      After the utterance of which expressions, she leaned forward, and snapped
      her fingers once, twice, thrice; each time nearer to the face of Mrs Gamp,
      and then rose to put on her bonnet, as one who felt that there was now a
      gulf between them, which nothing could ever bridge across.
    </p>
    <p>
      The shock of this blow was so violent and sudden, that Mrs Gamp sat
      staring at nothing with uplifted eyes, and her mouth open as if she were
      gasping for breath, until Betsey Prig had put on her bonnet and her shawl,
      and was gathering the latter about her throat. Then Mrs Gamp rose&mdash;morally
      and physically rose&mdash;and denounced her.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;What!&rsquo; said Mrs Gamp, &lsquo;you bage creetur, have I know&rsquo;d Mrs Harris five
      and thirty year, to be told at last that there ain&rsquo;t no sech a person
      livin&rsquo;! Have I stood her friend in all her troubles, great and small, for
      it to come at last to sech a end as this, which her own sweet picter
      hanging up afore you all the time, to shame your Bragian words! But well
      you mayn&rsquo;t believe there&rsquo;s no sech a creetur, for she wouldn&rsquo;t demean
      herself to look at you, and often has she said, when I have made mention
      of your name, which, to my sinful sorrow, I have done, &ldquo;What, Sairey Gamp!
      debage yourself to <i>her</i>!&rdquo; Go along with you!&rsquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;I&rsquo;m a-goin&rsquo;, ma&rsquo;am, ain&rsquo;t I?&rsquo; said Mrs Prig, stopping as she said it.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;You had better, ma&rsquo;am,&rsquo; said Mrs Gamp.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Do you know who you&rsquo;re talking to, ma&rsquo;am?&rsquo; inquired her visitor.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Aperiently,&rsquo; said Mrs Gamp, surveying her with scorn from head to foot,
      &lsquo;to Betsey Prig. Aperiently so. I know her. No one better. Go along with
      you!&rsquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;And <i>you </i>was a-goin&rsquo; to take me under you!&rsquo; cried Mrs Prig, surveying Mrs
      Gamp from head to foot in her turn. &lsquo;<i>You </i>was, was you? Oh, how kind! Why,
      deuce take your imperence,&rsquo; said Mrs Prig, with a rapid change from banter
      to ferocity, &lsquo;what do you mean?&rsquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Go along with you!&rsquo; said Mrs Gamp. &lsquo;I blush for you.&rsquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;You had better blush a little for yourself, while you <i>are </i>about it!&rsquo; said
      Mrs Prig. &lsquo;You and your Chuffeys! What, the poor old creetur isn&rsquo;t mad
      enough, isn&rsquo;t he? Aha!&rsquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;He&rsquo;d very soon be mad enough, if you had anything to do with him,&rsquo; said
      Mrs Gamp.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;And that&rsquo;s what I was wanted for, is it?&rsquo; cried Mrs Prig, triumphantly.
      &lsquo;Yes. But you&rsquo;ll find yourself deceived. I won&rsquo;t go near him. We shall see
      how you get on without me. I won&rsquo;t have nothink to do with him.&rsquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;You never spoke a truer word than that!&rsquo; said Mrs Gamp. &lsquo;Go along with
      you!&rsquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      She was prevented from witnessing the actual retirement of Mrs Prig from
      the room, notwithstanding the great desire she had expressed to behold it,
      by that lady, in her angry withdrawal, coming into contact with the
      bedstead, and bringing down the previously mentioned pippins; three or
      four of which came rattling on the head of Mrs Gamp so smartly, that when
      she recovered from this wooden shower-bath, Mrs Prig was gone.
    </p>
    <p>
      She had the satisfaction, however, of hearing the deep voice of Betsey,
      proclaiming her injuries and her determination to have nothing to do with
      Mr Chuffey, down the stairs, and along the passage, and even out in
      Kingsgate Street. Likewise of seeing in her own apartment, in the place of
      Mrs Prig, Mr Sweedlepipe and two gentlemen.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Why, bless my life!&rsquo; exclaimed the little barber, &lsquo;what&rsquo;s amiss? The
      noise you ladies have been making, Mrs Gamp! Why, these two gentlemen have
      been standing on the stairs, outside the door, nearly all the time, trying
      to make you hear, while you were pelting away, hammer and tongs! It&rsquo;ll be
      the death of the little bullfinch in the shop, that draws his own water.
      In his fright, he&rsquo;s been a-straining himself all to bits, drawing more
      water than he could drink in a twelvemonth. He must have thought it was
      Fire!&rsquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      Mrs Gamp had in the meanwhile sunk into her chair, from whence, turning up
      her overflowing eyes, and clasping her hands, she delivered the following
      lamentation:
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Oh, Mr Sweedlepipes, which Mr Westlock also, if my eyes do not deceive,
      and a friend not havin&rsquo; the pleasure of bein&rsquo; beknown, wot I have took
      from Betsey Prig this blessed night, no mortial creetur knows! If she had
      abuged me, bein&rsquo; in liquor, which I thought I smelt her wen she come, but
      could not so believe, not bein&rsquo; used myself&rsquo;&mdash;Mrs Gamp, by the way,
      was pretty far gone, and the fragrance of the teapot was strong in the
      room&mdash;&lsquo;I could have bore it with a thankful art. But the words she
      spoke of Mrs Harris, lambs could not forgive. No, Betsey!&rsquo; said Mrs Gamp,
      in a violent burst of feeling, &lsquo;nor worms forget!&rsquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      The little barber scratched his head, and shook it, and looked at the
      teapot, and gradually got out of the room. John Westlock, taking a chair,
      sat down on one side of Mrs Gamp. Martin, taking the foot of the bed,
      supported her on the other.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;You wonder what we want, I daresay,&rsquo; observed John. &lsquo;I&rsquo;ll tell you
      presently, when you have recovered. It&rsquo;s not pressing, for a few minutes
      or so. How do you find yourself? Better?&rsquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      Mrs Gamp shed more tears, shook her head and feebly pronounced Mrs
      Harris&rsquo;s name.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Have a little&mdash;&rsquo; John was at a loss what to call it.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Tea,&rsquo; suggested Martin.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;It ain&rsquo;t tea,&rsquo; said Mrs Gamp.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Physic of some sort, I suppose,&rsquo; cried John. &lsquo;Have a little.&rsquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      Mrs Gamp was prevailed upon to take a glassful. &lsquo;On condition,&rsquo; she
      passionately observed, &lsquo;as Betsey never has another stroke of work from
      me.&rsquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Certainly not,&rsquo; said John. &lsquo;She shall never help to nurse <i>me</i>.&rsquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;To think,&rsquo; said Mrs Gamp, &lsquo;as she should ever have helped to nuss that
      friend of yourn, and been so near of hearing things that&mdash;Ah!&rsquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      John looked at Martin.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Yes,&rsquo; he said. &lsquo;That was a narrow escape, Mrs Gamp.&rsquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Narrer, in-deed!&rsquo; she returned. &lsquo;It was only my having the night, and
      hearin&rsquo; of him in his wanderins; and her the day, that saved it. Wot would
      she have said and done, if she had know&rsquo;d what I know; that perfeejus
      wretch! Yet, oh good gracious me!&rsquo; cried Mrs Gamp, trampling on the floor,
      in the absence of Mrs Prig, &lsquo;that I should hear from that same woman&rsquo;s
      lips what I have heerd her speak of Mrs Harris!&rsquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Never mind,&rsquo; said John. &lsquo;You know it is not true.&rsquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Isn&rsquo;t true!&rsquo; cried Mrs Gamp. &lsquo;True! Don&rsquo;t I know as that dear woman is
      expecting of me at this minnit, Mr Westlock, and is a-lookin&rsquo; out of
      window down the street, with little Tommy Harris in her arms, as calls me
      his own Gammy, and truly calls, for bless the mottled little legs of that
      there precious child (like Canterbury Brawn his own dear father says,
      which so they are) his own I have been, ever since I found him, Mr
      Westlock, with his small red worsted shoe a-gurglin&rsquo; in his throat, where
      he had put it in his play, a chick, wile they was leavin&rsquo; of him on the
      floor a-lookin&rsquo; for it through the ouse and him a-choakin&rsquo; sweetly in the
      parlour! Oh, Betsey Prig, what wickedness you&rsquo;ve showed this night, but
      never shall you darken Sairey&rsquo;s doors agen, you twining serpiant!&rsquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;You were always so kind to her, too!&rsquo; said John, consolingly.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;That&rsquo;s the cutting part. That&rsquo;s where it hurts me, Mr Westlock,&rsquo; Mrs Gamp
      replied; holding out her glass unconsciously, while Martin filled it.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Chosen to help you with Mr Lewsome!&rsquo; said John. &lsquo;Chosen to help you with
      Mr Chuffey!&rsquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Chose once, but chose no more,&rsquo; cried Mrs Gamp. &lsquo;No pardnership with
      Betsey Prig agen, sir!&rsquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;No, no,&rsquo; said John. &lsquo;That would never do.&rsquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;I don&rsquo;t know as it ever would have done, sir,&rsquo; Mrs Gamp replied, with a
      solemnity peculiar to a certain stage of intoxication. &lsquo;Now that the
      marks,&rsquo; by which Mrs Gamp is supposed to have meant mask, &lsquo;is off that
      creetur&rsquo;s face, I do not think it ever would have done. There are reagions
      in families for keeping things a secret, Mr Westlock, and havin&rsquo; only them
      about you as you knows you can repoge in. Who could repoge in Betsey Prig,
      arter her words of Mrs Harris, setting in that chair afore my eyes!&rsquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Quite true,&rsquo; said John; &lsquo;quite. I hope you have time to find another
      assistant, Mrs Gamp?&rsquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      Between her indignation and the teapot, her powers of comprehending what
      was said to her began to fail. She looked at John with tearful eyes, and
      murmuring the well-remembered name which Mrs Prig had challenged&mdash;as
      if it were a talisman against all earthly sorrows&mdash;seemed to wander
      in her mind.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;I hope,&rsquo; repeated John, &lsquo;that you have time to find another assistant?&rsquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Which short it is, indeed,&rsquo; cried Mrs Gamp, turning up her languid eyes,
      and clasping Mr Westlock&rsquo;s wrist with matronly affection. &lsquo;To-morrow
      evenin&rsquo;, sir, I waits upon his friends. Mr Chuzzlewit apinted it from nine
      to ten.&rsquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;From nine to ten,&rsquo; said John, with a significant glance at Martin. &lsquo;and
      then Mr Chuffey retires into safe keeping, does he?&rsquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;He needs to be kep safe, I do assure you,&rsquo; Mrs Gamp replied with a
      mysterious air. &lsquo;Other people besides me has had a happy deliverance from
      Betsey Prig. I little know&rsquo;d that woman. She&rsquo;d have let it out!&rsquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Let <i>him </i>out, you mean,&rsquo; said John.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Do I!&rsquo; retorted Mrs Gamp. &lsquo;Oh!&rsquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      The severely ironical character of this reply was strengthened by a very
      slow nod, and a still slower drawing down of the corners of Mrs Gamp&rsquo;s
      mouth. She added with extreme stateliness of manner after indulging in a
      short doze:
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;But I am a-keepin&rsquo; of you gentlemen, and time is precious.&rsquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      Mingling with that delusion of the teapot which inspired her with the
      belief that they wanted her to go somewhere immediately, a shrewd
      avoidance of any further reference to the topics into which she had lately
      strayed, Mrs Gamp rose; and putting away the teapot in its accustomed
      place, and locking the cupboard with much gravity proceeded to attire
      herself for a professional visit.
    </p>
    <p>
      This preparation was easily made, as it required nothing more than the
      snuffy black bonnet, the snuffy black shawl, the pattens and the
      indispensable umbrella, without which neither a lying-in nor a laying-out
      could by any possibility be attempted. When Mrs Gamp had invested herself
      with these appendages she returned to her chair, and sitting down again,
      declared herself quite ready.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;It&rsquo;s a &lsquo;appiness to know as one can benefit the poor sweet creetur,&rsquo; she
      observed, &lsquo;I&rsquo;m sure. It isn&rsquo;t all as can. The torters Betsey Prig inflicts
      is frightful!&rsquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      Closing her eyes as she made this remark, in the acuteness of her
      commiseration for Betsey&rsquo;s patients, she forgot to open them again until
      she dropped a patten. Her nap was also broken at intervals like the fabled
      slumbers of Friar Bacon, by the dropping of the other patten, and of the
      umbrella. But when she had got rid of those incumbrances, her sleep was
      peaceful.
    </p>
    <p>
      The two young men looked at each other, ludicrously enough; and Martin,
      stifling his disposition to laugh, whispered in John Westlock&rsquo;s ear,
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;What shall we do now?&rsquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Stay here,&rsquo; he replied.
    </p>
    <p>
      Mrs Gamp was heard to murmur &lsquo;Mrs Harris&rsquo; in her sleep.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Rely upon it,&rsquo; whispered John, looking cautiously towards her, &lsquo;that you
      shall question this old clerk, though you go as Mrs Harris herself. We
      know quite enough to carry her our own way now, at all events; thanks to
      this quarrel, which confirms the old saying that when rogues fall out,
      honest people get what they want. Let Jonas Chuzzlewit look to himself;
      and let her sleep as long as she likes. We shall gain our end in good
      time.&rsquo;

    <h2>
      CHAPTER FIFTY
    </h2>
    <p>
      SURPRISES TOM PINCH VERY MUCH, AND SHOWS HOW CERTAIN CONFIDENCES PASSED
      BETWEEN HIM AND HIS SISTER
    </p>
    <p>
      It was the next evening; and Tom and his sister were sitting together
      before tea, talking, in their usual quiet way, about a great many things,
      but not at all about Lewsome&rsquo;s story or anything connected with it; for
      John Westlock&mdash;really John, for so young a man, was one of the most
      considerate fellows in the world&mdash;had particularly advised Tom not to
      mention it to his sister just yet, in case it should disquiet her. &lsquo;And I
      wouldn&rsquo;t, Tom,&rsquo; he said, with a little hesitation, &lsquo;I wouldn&rsquo;t have a
      shadow on her happy face, or an uneasy thought in her gentle heart, for
      all the wealth and honours of the universe!&rsquo; Really John was uncommonly
      kind; extraordinarily kind. If he had been her father, Tom said, he could
      not have taken a greater interest in her.
    </p>
    <p>
      But although Tom and his sister were extremely conversational, they were
      less lively, and less cheerful, than usual. Tom had no idea that this
      originated with Ruth, but took it for granted that he was rather dull
      himself. In truth he was; for the lightest cloud upon the Heaven of her
      quiet mind, cast its shadow upon Tom.
    </p>
    <p>
      And there was a cloud on little Ruth that evening. Yes, indeed. When Tom
      was looking in another direction, her bright eyes, stealing on towards his
      face, would sparkle still more brightly than their custom was, and then
      grow dim. When Tom was silent, looking out upon the summer weather, she
      would sometimes make a hasty movement, as if she were about to throw
      herself upon his neck; then check the impulse, and when he looked round,
      show a laughing face, and speak to him very merrily; when she had anything
      to give Tom, or had any excuse for coming near him, she would flutter
      about him, and lay her bashful hand upon his shoulder, and not be willing
      to withdraw it; and would show by all such means that there was something
      on her heart which in her great love she longed to say to him, but had not
      the courage to utter.
    </p>
    <p>
      So they were sitting, she with her work before her, but not working, and
      Tom with his book beside him, but not reading, when Martin knocked at the
      door. Anticipating who it was, Tom went to open it; and he and Martin came
      back into the room together. Tom looked surprised, for in answer to his
      cordial greeting Martin had hardly spoken a word.
    </p>
    <p>
      Ruth also saw that there was something strange in the manner of their
      visitor, and raised her eyes inquiringly to Tom&rsquo;s face, as if she were
      seeking an explanation there. Tom shook his head, and made the same mute
      appeal to Martin.
    </p>
    <p>
      Martin did not sit down but walked up to the window, and stood there
      looking out. He turned round after a few moments to speak, but hastily
      averted his head again, without doing so.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;What has happened, Martin?&rsquo; Tom anxiously inquired. &lsquo;My dear fellow, what
      bad news do you bring?&rsquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Oh, Tom!&rsquo; replied Martin, in a tone of deep reproach. &lsquo;To hear you feign
      that interest in anything that happens to me, hurts me even more than your
      ungenerous dealing.&rsquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;My ungenerous dealing! Martin! My&mdash;&rsquo; Tom could say no more.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;How could you, Tom, how could you suffer me to thank you so fervently and
      sincerely for your friendship; and not tell me, like a man, that you had
      deserted me! Was it true, Tom! Was it honest! Was it worthy of what you
      used to be&mdash;of what I am sure you used to be&mdash;to tempt me, when
      you had turned against me, into pouring out my heart! Oh, Tom!&rsquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      His tone was one of such strong injury and yet of so much grief for the
      loss of a friend he had trusted in&mdash;it expressed such high past love
      for Tom, and so much sorrow and compassion for his supposed unworthiness&mdash;that
      Tom, for a moment, put his hand before his face, and had no more power of
      justifying himself, than if he had been a monster of deceit and falsehood.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;I protest, as I must die,&rsquo; said Martin, &lsquo;that I grieve over the loss of
      what I thought you; and have no anger in the recollection of my own
      injuries. It is only at such a time, and after such a discovery, that we
      know the full measure of our old regard for the subject of it. I swear,
      little as I showed it&mdash;little as I know I showed it&mdash;that when I
      had the least consideration for you, Tom, I loved you like a brother.&rsquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      Tom was composed by this time, and might have been the Spirit of Truth, in
      a homely dress&mdash;it very often wears a homely dress, thank God!&mdash;when
      he replied to him.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Martin,&rsquo; he said, &lsquo;I don&rsquo;t know what is in your mind, or who has abused
      it, or by what extraordinary means. But the means are false. There is no
      truth whatever in the impression under which you labour. It is a delusion
      from first to last; and I warn you that you will deeply regret the wrong
      you do me. I can honestly say that I have been true to you, and to myself.
      You will be very sorry for this. Indeed, you will be very sorry for it,
      Martin.&rsquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;I <i>am</i> sorry,&rsquo; returned Martin, shaking his head. &lsquo;I think I never knew
      what it was to be sorry in my heart, until now.&rsquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;At least,&rsquo; said Tom, &lsquo;if I had always been what you charge me with being
      now, and had never had a place in your regard, but had always been
      despised by you, and had always deserved it, you should tell me in what
      you have found me to be treacherous; and on what grounds you proceed. I do
      not intreat you, therefore, to give me that satisfaction as a favour,
      Martin, but I ask it of you as a right.&rsquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;My own eyes are my witnesses,&rsquo; returned Martin. &lsquo;Am I to believe them?&rsquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;No,&rsquo; said Tom, calmly. &lsquo;Not if they accuse me.&rsquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Your own words. Your own manner,&rsquo; pursued Martin. &lsquo;Am I to believe <i>them</i>?&rsquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;No,&rsquo; replied Tom, calmly. &lsquo;Not if they accuse me. But they never have
      accused me. Whoever has perverted them to such a purpose, has wronged me
      almost as cruelly&rsquo;&mdash;his calmness rather failed him here&mdash;&lsquo;as you
      have done.&rsquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;I came here,&rsquo; said Martin; &lsquo;and I appeal to your good sister to hear me&mdash;&rsquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Not to her,&rsquo; interrupted Tom. &lsquo;Pray, do not appeal to her. She will never
      believe you.&rsquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      He drew her arm through his own, as he said it.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;I believe it, Tom!&rsquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;No, no,&rsquo; cried Tom, &lsquo;of course not. I said so. Why, tut, tut, tut. What a
      silly little thing you are!&rsquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;I never meant,&rsquo; said Martin, hastily, &lsquo;to appeal to you against your
      brother. Do not think me so unmanly and unkind. I merely appealed to you
      to hear my declaration, that I came here for no purpose of reproach&mdash;I
      have not one reproach to vent&mdash;but in deep regret. You could not know
      in what bitterness of regret, unless you knew how often I have thought of
      Tom; how long in almost hopeless circumstances, I have looked forward to
      the better estimation of his friendship; and how steadfastly I have
      believed and trusted in him.&rsquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Tut, tut,&rsquo; said Tom, stopping her as she was about to speak. &lsquo;He is
      mistaken. He is deceived. Why should you mind? He is sure to be set right
      at last.&rsquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Heaven bless the day that sets me right!&rsquo; cried Martin, &lsquo;if it could ever
      come!&rsquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Amen!&rsquo; said Tom. &lsquo;And it will!&rsquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      Martin paused, and then said in a still milder voice:
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;You have chosen for yourself, Tom, and will be relieved by our parting.
      It is not an angry one. There is no anger on my side&mdash;&rsquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;There is none on mine,&rsquo; said Tom.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;&mdash;It is merely what you have brought about, and worked to bring
      about. I say again, you have chosen for yourself. You have made the choice
      that might have been expected in most people situated as you are, but
      which I did not expect in you. For that, perhaps, I should blame my own
      judgment more than you. There is wealth and favour worth having, on one
      side; and there is the worthless friendship of an abandoned, struggling
      fellow, on the other. You were free to make your election, and you made
      it; and the choice was not difficult. But those who have not the courage
      to resist such temptations, should have the courage to avow what they have
      yielded to them; and I <i>do</i> blame you for this, Tom: that you received me
      with a show of warmth, encouraged me to be frank and plain-spoken, tempted
      me to confide in you, and professed that you were able to be mine; when
      you had sold yourself to others. I do not believe,&rsquo; said Martin, with
      emotion&mdash;&lsquo;hear me say it from my heart&mdash;I <i>cannot </i>believe, Tom,
      now that I am standing face to face with you, that it would have been in
      your nature to do me any serious harm, even though I had not discovered,
      by chance, in whose employment you were. But I should have encumbered you;
      I should have led you into more double-dealing; I should have hazarded
      your retaining the favour for which you have paid so high a price,
      bartering away your former self; and it is best for both of us that I have
      found out what you so much desired to keep secret.&rsquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Be just,&rsquo; said Tom; who, had not removed his mild gaze from Martin&rsquo;s face
      since the commencement of this last address; &lsquo;be just even in your
      injustice, Martin. You forget. You have not yet told me what your
      accusation is!&rsquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Why should I?&rsquo; returned Martin, waving his hand, and moving towards the
      door. &lsquo;You could not know it the better for my dwelling on it, and though
      it would be really none the worse, it might seem to me to be. No, Tom.
      Bygones shall be bygones between us. I can take leave of you at this
      moment, and in this place&mdash;in which you are so amiable and so good&mdash;as
      heartily, if not as cheerfully, as ever I have done since we first met.
      All good go with you, Tom!&mdash;I&mdash;&rsquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;You leave me so? You can leave me so, can you?&rsquo; said Tom.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;I&mdash;you&mdash;you have chosen for yourself, Tom! I&mdash;I hope it
      was a rash choice,&rsquo; Martin faltered. &lsquo;I think it was. I am sure it was!
      Good-bye!&rsquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      And he was gone.
    </p>
    <p>
      Tom led his little sister to her chair, and sat down in his own. He took
      his book, and read, or seemed to read. Presently he said aloud, turning a
      leaf as he spoke: &lsquo;He will be very sorry for this.&rsquo; And a tear stole down
      his face, and dropped upon the page.
    </p>
    <p>
      Ruth nestled down beside him on her knees, and clasped her arms about his
      neck.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;No, Tom! No, no! Be comforted! Dear Tom!&rsquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;I am quite&mdash;comforted,&rsquo; said Tom. &lsquo;It will be set right.&rsquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Such a cruel, bad return!&rsquo; cried Ruth.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;No, no,&rsquo; said Tom. &lsquo;He believes it. I cannot imagine why. But it will be
      set right.&rsquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      More closely yet, she nestled down about him; and wept as if her heart
      would break.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Don&rsquo;t. Don&rsquo;t,&rsquo; said Tom. &lsquo;Why do you hide your face, my dear!&rsquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      Then in a burst of tears, it all broke out at last.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Oh Tom, dear Tom, I know your secret heart. I have found it out; you
      couldn&rsquo;t hide the truth from me. Why didn&rsquo;t you tell me? I am sure I could
      have made you happier, if you had! You love her, Tom, so dearly!&rsquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      Tom made a motion with his hand as if he would have put his sister
      hurriedly away; but it clasped upon hers, and all his little history was
      written in the action. All its pathetic eloquence was in the silent touch.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;In spite of that,&rsquo; said Ruth, &lsquo;you have been so faithful and so good,
      dear; in spite of that, you have been so true and self-denying, and have
      struggled with yourself; in spite of that, you have been so gentle, and so
      kind, and even-tempered, that I have never seen you give a hasty look, or
      heard you say one irritable word. In spite of all, you have been so
      cruelly mistaken. Oh Tom, dear Tom, will <i>this </i>be set right too! Will it,
      Tom? Will you always have this sorrow in your breast; you who deserve to
      be so happy; or is there any hope?&rsquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      And still she hid her face from Tom, and clasped him round the neck, and
      wept for him, and poured out all her woman&rsquo;s heart and soul in the relief
      and pain of this disclosure.
    </p>
    <p>
      It was not very long before she and Tom were sitting side by side, and she
      was looking with an earnest quietness in Tom&rsquo;s face. Then Tom spoke to her
      thus, cheerily, though gravely:
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;I am very glad, my dear, that this has passed between us. Not because it
      assures me of your tender affection (for I was well assured of that
      before), but because it relieves my mind of a great weight.&rsquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      Tom&rsquo;s eyes glistened when he spoke of her affection; and he kissed her on
      the cheek.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;My dear girl,&rsquo; said Tom; &lsquo;with whatever feeling I regard her&rsquo;&mdash;they
      seemed to avoid the name by mutual consent&mdash;&lsquo;I have long ago&mdash;I
      am sure I may say from the very first&mdash;looked upon it as a dream. As
      something that might possibly have happened under very different
      circumstances, but which can never be. Now, tell me. What would you have
      set right?&rsquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      She gave Tom such a significant little look, that he was obliged to take
      it for an answer whether he would or no; and to go on.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;By her own choice and free consent, my love, she is betrothed to Martin;
      and was, long before either of them knew of my existence. You would have
      her betrothed to me?&rsquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Yes,&rsquo; she said directly.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Yes,&rsquo; rejoined Tom, &lsquo;but that might be setting it wrong, instead of
      right. Do you think,&rsquo; said Tom, with a grave smile, &lsquo;that even if she had
      never seen him, it is very likely she would have fallen in love with Me?&rsquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Why not, dear Tom?&rsquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      Tom shook his head, and smiled again.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;You think of me, Ruth,&rsquo; said Tom, &lsquo;and it is very natural that you
      should, as if I were a character in a book; and you make it a sort of
      poetical justice that I should, by some impossible means or other, come,
      at last, to marry the person I love. But there is a much higher justice
      than poetical justice, my dear, and it does not order events upon the same
      principle. Accordingly, people who read about heroes in books, and choose
      to make heroes of themselves out of books, consider it a very fine thing
      to be discontented and gloomy, and misanthropical, and perhaps a little
      blasphemous, because they cannot have everything ordered for their
      individual accommodation. Would you like me to become one of that sort of
      people?&rsquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;No, Tom. But still I know,&rsquo; she added timidly, &lsquo;that this is a sorrow to
      you in your own better way.&rsquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      Tom thought of disputing the position. But it would have been mere folly,
      and he gave it up.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;My dear,&rsquo; said Tom, &lsquo;I will repay your affection with the Truth and all
      the Truth. It is a sorrow to me. I have proved it to be so sometimes,
      though I have always striven against it. But somebody who is precious to
      you may die, and you may dream that you are in heaven with the departed
      spirit, and you may find it a sorrow to wake to the life on earth, which
      is no harder to be borne than when you fell asleep. It is sorrowful to me
      to contemplate my dream which I always knew was a dream, even when it
      first presented itself; but the realities about me are not to blame. They
      are the same as they were. My sister, my sweet companion, who makes this
      place so dear, is she less devoted to me, Ruth, than she would have been,
      if this vision had never troubled me? My old friend John, who might so
      easily have treated me with coldness and neglect, is he less cordial to
      me? The world about me, is there less good in that? Are my words to be
      harsh and my looks to be sour, and is my heart to grow cold, because there
      has fallen in my way a good and beautiful creature, who but for the
      selfish regret that I cannot call her my own, would, like all other good
      and beautiful creatures, make me happier and better! No, my dear sister.
      No,&rsquo; said Tom stoutly. &lsquo;Remembering all my means of happiness, I hardly
      dare to call this lurking something a sorrow; but whatever name it may
      justly bear, I thank Heaven that it renders me more sensible of affection
      and attachment, and softens me in fifty ways. Not less happy. Not less
      happy, Ruth!&rsquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      She could not speak to him, but she loved him, as he well deserved. Even
      as he deserved, she loved him.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;She will open Martin&rsquo;s eyes,&rsquo; said Tom, with a glow of pride, &lsquo;and that
      (which is indeed wrong) will be set right. Nothing will persuade her, I
      know, that I have betrayed him. It will be set right through her, and he
      will be very sorry for it. Our secret, Ruth, is our own, and lives and
      dies with us. I don&rsquo;t believe I ever could have told it you,&rsquo; said Tom,
      with a smile, &lsquo;but how glad I am to think you have found it out!&rsquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      They had never taken such a pleasant walk as they took that night. Tom
      told her all so freely and so simply, and was so desirous to return her
      tenderness with his fullest confidence, that they prolonged it far beyond
      their usual hour, and sat up late when they came home. And when they
      parted for the night there was such a tranquil, beautiful expression in
      Tom&rsquo;s face, that she could not bear to shut it out, but going back on
      tiptoe to his chamber-door, looked in and stood there till he saw her, and
      then embracing him again, withdrew. And in her prayers and in her sleep&mdash;good
      times to be remembered with such fervour, Tom!&mdash;his name was
      uppermost.
    </p>
    <p>
      When he was left alone, Tom pondered very much on this discovery of hers,
      and greatly wondered what had led her to it. &lsquo;Because,&rsquo; thought Tom, &lsquo;I
      have been so very careful. It was foolish and unnecessary in me, as I
      clearly see now, when I am so relieved by her knowing it; but I have been
      so very careful to conceal it from her. Of course I knew that she was
      intelligent and quick, and for that reason was more upon my guard; but I
      was not in the least prepared for this. I am sure her discovery has been
      sudden too. Dear me!&rsquo; said Tom. &lsquo;It&rsquo;s a most singular instance of
      penetration!&rsquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      Tom could not get it out of his head. There it was, when his head was on
      his pillow.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;How she trembled when she began to tell me she knew it!&rsquo; thought Tom,
      recalling all the little incidents and circumstances; &lsquo;and how her face
      flushed! But that was natural! Oh, quite natural! That needs no accounting
      for.&rsquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      Tom little thought how natural it was. Tom little knew that there was that
      in Ruth&rsquo;s own heart, but newly set there, which had helped her to the
      reading of his mystery. Ah, Tom! He didn&rsquo;t understand the whispers of the
      Temple Fountain, though he passed it every day.
    </p>
    <p>
      Who so lively and cheerful as busy Ruth next morning! Her early tap at
      Tom&rsquo;s door, and her light foot outside, would have been music to him
      though she had not spoken. But she said it was the brightest morning ever
      seen; and so it was; and if it had been otherwise, she would have made it
      so to Tom.
    </p>
    <p>
      She was ready with his neat breakfast when he went downstairs, and had her
      bonnet ready for the early walk, and was so full of news, that Tom was
      lost in wonder. She might have been up all night, collecting it for his
      entertainment. There was Mr Nadgett not come home yet, and there was bread
      down a penny a loaf, and there was twice as much strength in this tea as
      in the last, and the milk-woman&rsquo;s husband had come out of the hospital
      cured, and the curly-headed child over the way had been lost all
      yesterday, and she was going to make all sorts of preserves in a desperate
      hurry, and there happened to be a saucepan in the house which was the very
      saucepan for the purpose; and she knew all about the last book Tom had
      brought home, all through, though it was a teaser to read; and she had so
      much to tell him that she had finished breakfast first. Then she had her
      little bonnet on, and the tea and sugar locked up, and the keys in her
      reticule, and the flower, as usual, in Tom&rsquo;s coat, and was in all respects
      quite ready to accompany him, before Tom knew she had begun to prepare.
      And in short, as Tom said, with a confidence in his own assertion which
      amounted to a defiance of the public in general, there never was such a
      little woman.
    </p>
    <p>
      She made Tom talkative. It was impossible to resist her. She put such
      enticing questions to him; about books, and about dates of churches, and
      about organs and about the Temple, and about all kinds of things. Indeed,
      she lightened the way (and Tom&rsquo;s heart with it) to that degree, that the
      Temple looked quite blank and solitary when he parted from her at the
      gate.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;No Mr Fips&rsquo;s friend to-day, I suppose,&rsquo; thought Tom, as he ascended the
      stairs.
    </p>
    <p>
      Not yet, at any rate, for the door was closed as usual, and Tom opened it
      with his key. He had got the books into perfect order now, and had mended
      the torn leaves, and had pasted up the broken backs, and substituted neat
      labels for the worn-out letterings. It looked a different place, it was so
      orderly and neat. Tom felt some pride in comtemplating the change he had
      wrought, though there was no one to approve or disapprove of it.
    </p>
    <p>
      He was at present occupied in making a fair copy of his draught of the
      catalogue; on which, as there was no hurry, he was painfully concentrating
      all the ingenious and laborious neatness he had ever expended on map or
      plan in Mr Pecksniff&rsquo;s workroom. It was a very marvel of a catalogue; for
      Tom sometimes thought he was really getting his money too easily, and he
      had determined within himself that this document should take a little of
      his superfluous leisure out of him.
    </p>
    <p>
      So with pens and ruler, and compasses and india-rubber, and pencil, and
      black ink, and red ink, Tom worked away all the morning. He thought a good
      deal about Martin, and their interview of yesterday, and would have been
      far easier in his mind if he could have resolved to confide it to his
      friend John, and to have taken his opinion on the subject. But besides
      that he knew what John&rsquo;s boiling indignation would be, he bethought
      himself that he was helping Martin now in a matter of great moment, and
      that to deprive the latter of his assistance at such a crisis of affairs,
      would be to inflict a serious injury upon him.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;So I&rsquo;ll keep it to myself,&rsquo; said Tom, with a sigh. &lsquo;I&rsquo;ll keep it to
      myself.&rsquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      And to work he went again, more assiduously than ever, with the pens, and
      the ruler, and the india-rubber, and the pencils, and the red ink, that he
      might forget it.
    </p>
    <p>
      He had laboured away another hour or more, when he heard a footstep in the
      entry, down below.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Ah!&rsquo; said Tom, looking towards the door; &lsquo;time was, not long ago either,
      when that would have set me wondering and expecting. But I have left off
      now.&rsquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      The footstep came on, up the stairs.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Thirty-six, thirty-seven, thirty-eight,&rsquo; said Tom, counting. &lsquo;Now you&rsquo;ll
      stop. Nobody ever comes past the thirty-eighth stair.&rsquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      The person did, certainly, but only to take breath; for up the footstep
      came again. Forty, forty-one, forty-two, and so on.
    </p>
    <p>
      The door stood open. As the tread advanced, Tom looked impatiently and
      eagerly towards it. When a figure came upon the landing, and arriving in
      the doorway, stopped and gazed at him, he rose up from his chair, and half
      believed he saw a spirit.
    </p>

    <p>
      Old Martin Chuzzlewit! The same whom he had left at Mr Pecksniff&rsquo;s, weak
      and sinking!
    </p>
    <p>
      The same? No, not the same, for this old man, though old, was strong, and
      leaned upon his stick with a vigorous hand, while with the other he signed
      to Tom to make no noise. One glance at the resolute face, the watchful
      eye, the vigorous hand upon the staff, the triumphant purpose in the
      figure, and such a light broke in on Tom as blinded him.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;You have expected me,&rsquo; said Martin, &lsquo;a long time.&rsquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;I was told that my employer would arrive soon,&rsquo; said Tom; &lsquo;but&mdash;&rsquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;I know. You were ignorant who he was. It was my desire. I am glad it has
      been so well observed. I intended to have been with you much sooner. I
      thought the time had come. I thought I could know no more, and no worse,
      of him, than I did on that day when I saw you last. But I was wrong.&rsquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      He had by this time come up to Tom, and now he grasped his hand.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;I have lived in his house, Pinch, and had him fawning on me days and
      weeks and months. You know it. I have suffered him to treat me like his
      tool and instrument. You know it; you have seen me there. I have undergone
      ten thousand times as much as I could have endured if I had been the
      miserable weak old man he took me for. You know it. I have seen him offer
      love to Mary. You know it; who better&mdash;who better, my true heart! I
      have had his base soul bare before me, day by day, and have not betrayed
      myself once. I never could have undergone such torture but for looking
      forward to this time.&rsquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      He stopped, even in the passion of his speech&mdash;if that can be called
      passion which was so resolute and steady&mdash;to press Tom&rsquo;s hand again.
      Then he said, in great excitement:
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Close the door, close the door. He will not be long after me, but may
      come too soon. The time now drawing on,&rsquo; said the old man, hurriedly&mdash;his
      eyes and whole face brightening as he spoke&mdash;&lsquo;will make amends for
      all. I wouldn&rsquo;t have him die or hang himself, for millions of golden
      pieces! Close the door!&rsquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      Tom did so; hardly knowing yet whether he was awake or in a dream.

    <h2>
      CHAPTER FIFTY-ONE
    </h2>
    <p>
      SHEDS NEW AND BRIGHTER LIGHT UPON THE VERY DARK PLACE; AND CONTAINS THE
      SEQUEL OF THE ENTERPRISE OF MR JONAS AND HIS FRIEND
    </p>
    <p>
      The night had now come, when the old clerk was to be delivered over to his
      keepers. In the midst of his guilty distractions, Jonas had not forgotten
      it.
    </p>
    <p>
      It was a part of his guilty state of mind to remember it; for on his
      persistence in the scheme depended one of his precautions for his own
      safety. A hint, a word, from the old man, uttered at such a moment in
      attentive ears, might fire the train of suspicion, and destroy him. His
      watchfulness of every avenue by which the discovery of his guilt might be
      approached, sharpened with his sense of the danger by which he was
      encompassed. With murder on his soul, and its innumerable alarms and
      terrors dragging at him night and day, he would have repeated the crime,
      if he had seen a path of safety stretching out beyond. It was in his
      punishment; it was in his guilty condition. The very deed which his fears
      rendered insupportable, his fears would have impelled him to commit again.
    </p>
    <p>
      But keeping the old man close, according to his design, would serve his
      turn. His purpose was to escape, when the first alarm and wonder had
      subsided; and when he could make the attempt without awakening instant
      suspicion. In the meanwhile these women would keep him quiet; and if the
      talking humour came upon him, would not be easily startled. He knew their
      trade.
    </p>
    <p>
      Nor had he spoken idly when he said the old man should be gagged. He had
      resolved to ensure his silence; and he looked to the end, not the means.
      He had been rough and rude and cruel to the old man all his life; and
      violence was natural to his mind in connection with him. &lsquo;He shall be
      gagged if he speaks, and pinioned if he writes,&rsquo; said Jonas, looking at
      him; for they sat alone together. &lsquo;He is mad enough for that; I&rsquo;ll go
      through with it!&rsquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      Hush!
    </p>
    <p>
      Still listening! To every sound. He had listened ever since, and it had
      not come yet. The exposure of the Assurance office; the flight of Crimple
      and Bullamy with the plunder, and among the rest, as he feared, with his
      own bill, which he had not found in the pocket-book of the murdered man,
      and which with Mr Pecksniff&rsquo;s money had probably been remitted to one or
      other of those trusty friends for safe deposit at the banker&rsquo;s; his
      immense losses, and peril of being still called to account as a partner in
      the broken firm; all these things rose in his mind at one time and always,
      but he could not contemplate them. He was aware of their presence, and of
      the rage, discomfiture, and despair, they brought along with them; but he
      thought&mdash;of his own controlling power and direction he thought&mdash;of
      the one dread question only. When they would find the body in the wood.
    </p>
    <p>
      He tried&mdash;he had never left off trying&mdash;not to forget it was
      there, for that was impossible, but to forget to weary himself by drawing
      vivid pictures of it in his fancy; by going softly about it and about it
      among the leaves, approaching it nearer and nearer through a gap in the
      boughs, and startling the very flies that were thickly sprinkled all over
      it, like heaps of dried currants. His mind was fixed and fastened on the
      discovery, for intelligence of which he listened intently to every cry and
      shout; listened when any one came in or went out; watched from the window
      the people who passed up and down the street; mistrusted his own looks and
      words. And the more his thoughts were set upon the discovery, the stronger
      was the fascination which attracted them to the thing itself; lying alone
      in the wood. He was for ever showing and presenting it, as it were, to
      every creature whom he saw. &lsquo;Look here! Do you know of this? Is it found?
      Do you suspect <i>me</i>?&rsquo; If he had been condemned to bear the body in his arms,
      and lay it down for recognition at the feet of every one he met, it could
      not have been more constantly with him, or a cause of more monotonous and
      dismal occupation than it was in this state of his mind.
    </p>
    <p>
      Still he was not sorry. It was no contrition or remorse for what he had
      done that moved him; it was nothing but alarm for his own security. The
      vague consciousness he possessed of having wrecked his fortune in the
      murderous venture, intensified his hatred and revenge, and made him set
      the greater store by what he had gained The man was dead; nothing could
      undo that. He felt a triumph yet, in the reflection.
    </p>
    <p>
      He had kept a jealous watch on Chuffey ever since the deed; seldom leaving
      him but on compulsion, and then for as short intervals as possible. They
      were alone together now. It was twilight, and the appointed time drew near
      at hand. Jonas walked up and down the room. The old man sat in his
      accustomed corner.
    </p>
    <p>
      The slightest circumstance was matter of disquiet to the murderer, and he
      was made uneasy at this time by the absence of his wife, who had left home
      early in the afternoon, and had not returned yet. No tenderness for her
      was at the bottom of this; but he had a misgiving that she might have been
      waylaid, and tempted into saying something that would criminate him when
      the news came. For anything he knew, she might have knocked at the door of
      his room, while he was away, and discovered his plot. Confound her, it was
      like her pale face to be wandering up and down the house! Where was she
      now?
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;She went to her good friend, Mrs Todgers,&rsquo; said the old man, when he
      asked the question with an angry oath.
    </p>
    <p>
      Aye! To be sure! Always stealing away into the company of that woman. She
      was no friend of his. Who could tell what devil&rsquo;s mischief they might
      hatch together! Let her be fetched home directly.
    </p>
    <p>
      The old man, muttering some words softly, rose as if he would have gone
      himself, but Jonas thrust him back into his chair with an impatient
      imprecation, and sent a servant-girl to fetch her. When he had charged her
      with her errand he walked to and fro again, and never stopped till she
      came back, which she did pretty soon; the way being short, and the woman
      having made good haste.
    </p>
    <p>
      Well! Where was she? Had she come?
    </p>
    <p>
      No. She had left there, full three hours.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Left there! Alone?&rsquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      The messenger had not asked; taking that for granted.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Curse you for a fool. Bring candles!&rsquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      She had scarcely left the room when the old clerk, who had been unusually
      observant of him ever since he had asked about his wife, came suddenly
      upon him.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Give her up!&rsquo; cried the old man. &lsquo;Come! Give her up to me! Tell me what
      you have done with her. Quick! I have made no promises on that score. Tell
      me what you have done with her.&rsquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      He laid his hands upon his collar as he spoke, and grasped it; tightly
      too.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;You shall not leave me!&rsquo; cried the old man. &lsquo;I am strong enough to cry
      out to the neighbours, and I will, unless you give her up. Give her up to
      me!&rsquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      Jonas was so dismayed and conscience-stricken, that he had not even
      hardihood enough to unclench the old man&rsquo;s hands with his own; but stood
      looking at him as well as he could in the darkness, without moving a
      finger. It was as much as he could do to ask him what he meant.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;I will know what you have done with her!&rsquo; retorted Chuffey. &lsquo;If you hurt
      a hair of her head, you shall answer it. Poor thing! Poor thing! Where is
      she?&rsquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Why, you old madman!&rsquo; said Jonas, in a low voice, and with trembling
      lips. &lsquo;What Bedlam fit has come upon you now?&rsquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;It is enough to make me mad, seeing what I have seen in this house!&rsquo;
      cried Chuffey. &lsquo;Where is my dear old master! Where is his only son that I
      have nursed upon my knee, a child! Where is she, she who was the last; she
      that I&rsquo;ve seen pining day by day, and heard weeping in the dead of night!
      She was the last, the last of all my friends! Heaven help me, she was the
      very last!&rsquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      Seeing that the tears were stealing down his face, Jonas mustered courage
      to unclench his hands, and push him off before he answered:
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Did you hear me ask for her? Did you hear me send for her? How can I give
      you up what I haven&rsquo;t got, idiot! Ecod, I&rsquo;d give her up to you and
      welcome, if I could; and a precious pair you&rsquo;d be!&rsquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;If she has come to any harm,&rsquo; cried Chuffey, &lsquo;mind! I&rsquo;m old and silly;
      but I have my memory sometimes; and if she has come to any harm&mdash;&rsquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Devil take you,&rsquo; interrupted Jonas, but in a suppressed voice still;
      &lsquo;what harm do you suppose she has come to? I know no more where she is
      than you do; I wish I did. Wait till she comes home, and see; she can&rsquo;t be
      long. Will that content you?&rsquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Mind!&rsquo; exclaimed the old man. &lsquo;Not a hair of her head! not a hair of her
      head ill-used! I won&rsquo;t bear it. I&mdash;I&mdash;have borne it too long
      Jonas. I am silent, but I&mdash;I&mdash;I can speak. I&mdash;I&mdash;I can
      speak&mdash;&rsquo; he stammered, as he crept back to his chair, and turned a
      threatening, though a feeble, look upon him.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;You can speak, can you!&rsquo; thought Jonas. &lsquo;So, so, we&rsquo;ll stop your
      speaking. It&rsquo;s well I knew of this in good time. Prevention is better than
      cure.&rsquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      He had made a poor show of playing the bully and evincing a desire to
      conciliate at the same time, but was so afraid of the old man that great
      drops had started out upon his brow; and they stood there yet. His unusual
      tone of voice and agitated manner had sufficiently expressed his fear; but
      his face would have done so now, without that aid, as he again walked to
      and fro, glancing at him by the candelight.
    </p>
    <p>
      He stopped at the window to think. An opposite shop was lighted up; and
      the tradesman and a customer were reading some printed bill together
      across the counter. The sight brought him back, instantly, to the
      occupation he had forgotten. &lsquo;Look here! Do you know of this? Is it found?
      Do you suspect <i>me</i>?&rsquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      A hand upon the door. &lsquo;What&rsquo;s that!&rsquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;A pleasant evenin&rsquo;,&rsquo; said the voice of Mrs Gamp, &lsquo;though warm, which,
      bless you, Mr Chuzzlewit, we must expect when cowcumbers is three for
      twopence. How does Mr Chuffey find his self to-night, sir?&rsquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      Mrs Gamp kept particularly close to the door in saying this, and curtseyed
      more than usual. She did not appear to be quite so much at her ease as she
      generally was.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Get him to his room,&rsquo; said Jonas, walking up to her, and speaking in her
      ear. &lsquo;He has been raving to-night&mdash;stark mad. Don&rsquo;t talk while he&rsquo;s
      here, but come down again.&rsquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Poor sweet dear!&rsquo; cried Mrs Gamp, with uncommon tenderness. &lsquo;He&rsquo;s all of
      a tremble.&rsquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Well he may be,&rsquo; said Jonas, &lsquo;after the mad fit he has had. Get him
      upstairs.&rsquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      She was by this time assisting him to rise.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;There&rsquo;s my blessed old chick!&rsquo; cried Mrs Gamp, in a tone that was at once
      soothing and encouraging. &lsquo;There&rsquo;s my darlin&rsquo; Mr Chuffey! Now come up to
      your own room, sir, and lay down on your bed a bit; for you&rsquo;re a-shakin&rsquo;
      all over, as if your precious jints was hung upon wires. That&rsquo;s a good
      creetur! Come with Sairey!&rsquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Is she come home?&rsquo; inquired the old man.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;She&rsquo;ll be here directly minit,&rsquo; returned Mrs Gamp. &lsquo;Come with Sairey, Mr
      Chuffey. Come with your own Sairey!&rsquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      The good woman had no reference to any female in the world in promising
      this speedy advent of the person for whom Mr Chuffey inquired, but merely
      threw it out as a means of pacifying the old man. It had its effect, for
      he permitted her to lead him away; and they quitted the room together.
    </p>
    <p>
      Jonas looked out of the window again. They were still reading the printed
      paper in the shop opposite, and a third man had joined in the perusal.
      What could it be, to interest them so?&rsquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      A dispute or discussion seemed to arise among them, for they all looked up
      from their reading together, and one of the three, who had been glancing
      over the shoulder of another, stepped back to explain or illustrate some
      action by his gestures.
    </p>
    <p>
      Horror! How like the blow he had struck in the wood!
    </p>
    <p>
      It beat him from the window as if it had lighted on himself. As he
      staggered into a chair, he thought of the change in Mrs Gamp exhibited in
      her new-born tenderness to her charge. Was that because it was found?&mdash;because
      she knew of it?&mdash;because she suspected him?
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Mr Chuffey is a-lyin&rsquo; down,&rsquo; said Mrs Gamp, returning, &lsquo;and much good may
      it do him, Mr Chuzzlewit, which harm it can&rsquo;t and good it may; be joyful!&rsquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Sit down,&rsquo; said Jonas, hoarsely, &lsquo;and let us get this business done.
      Where is the other woman?&rsquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;The other person&rsquo;s with him now,&rsquo; she answered.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;That&rsquo;s right,&rsquo; said Jonas. &lsquo;He is not fit to be left to himself. Why, he
      fastened on me to-night; here, upon my coat; like a savage dog. Old as he
      is, and feeble as he is usually, I had some trouble to shake him off. You&mdash;Hush!&mdash;It&rsquo;s
      nothing. You told me the other woman&rsquo;s name. I forget it.&rsquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;I mentioned Betsey Prig,&rsquo; said Mrs Gamp.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;She is to be trusted, is she?&rsquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;That she ain&rsquo;t!&rsquo; said Mrs Gamp; &lsquo;nor have I brought her, Mr Chuzzlewit.
      I&rsquo;ve brought another, which engages to give every satigefaction.&rsquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;What is her name?&rsquo; asked Jonas.
    </p>
    <p>
      Mrs Gamp looked at him in an odd way without returning any answer, but
      appeared to understand the question too.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;What is her name?&rsquo; repeated Jonas.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Her name,&rsquo; said Mrs Gamp, &lsquo;is Harris.&rsquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      It was extraordinary how much effort it cost Mrs Gamp to pronounce the
      name she was commonly so ready with. She made some three or four gasps
      before she could get it out; and, when she had uttered it, pressed her
      hand upon her side, and turned up her eyes, as if she were going to faint
      away. But, knowing her to labour under a complication of internal
      disorders, which rendered a few drops of spirits indispensable at certain
      times to her existence, and which came on very strong when that remedy was
      not at hand, Jonas merely supposed her to be the victim of one of these
      attacks.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Well!&rsquo; he said, hastily, for he felt how incapable he was of confining
      his wandering attention to the subject. &lsquo;You and she have arranged to take
      care of him, have you?&rsquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      Mrs Gamp replied in the affirmative, and softly discharged herself of her
      familiar phrase, &lsquo;Turn and turn about; one off, one on.&rsquo; But she spoke so
      tremulously that she felt called upon to add, &lsquo;which fiddle-strings is
      weakness to expredge my nerves this night!&rsquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      Jonas stopped to listen. Then said, hurriedly:
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;We shall not quarrel about terms. Let them be the same as they were
      before. Keep him close, and keep him quiet. He must be restrained. He has
      got it in his head to-night that my wife&rsquo;s dead, and has been attacking me
      as if I had killed her. It&rsquo;s&mdash;it&rsquo;s common with mad people to take the
      worst fancies of those they like best. Isn&rsquo;t it?&rsquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      Mrs Gamp assented with a short groan.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Keep him close, then, or in one of his fits he&rsquo;ll be doing me a mischief.
      And don&rsquo;t trust him at any time; for when he seems most rational, he&rsquo;s
      wildest in his talk. But that you know already. Let me see the other.&rsquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;The t&rsquo;other person, sir?&rsquo; said Mrs Gamp.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Aye! Go you to him and send the other. Quick! I&rsquo;m busy.&rsquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      Mrs Gamp took two or three backward steps towards the door, and stopped
      there.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;It is your wishes, Mr Chuzzlewit,&rsquo; she said, in a sort of quavering
      croak, &lsquo;to see the t&rsquo;other person. Is it?&rsquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      But the ghastly change in Jonas told her that the other person was already
      seen. Before she could look round towards the door, she was put aside by
      old Martin&rsquo;s hand; and Chuffey and John Westlock entered with him.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Let no one leave the house,&rsquo; said Martin. &lsquo;This man is my brother&rsquo;s son.
      Ill-met, ill-trained, ill-begotten. If he moves from the spot on which he
      stands, or speaks a word above his breath to any person here, open the
      window, and call for help!&rsquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;What right have you to give such directions in this house?&rsquo; asked Jonas
      faintly.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;The right of your wrong-doing. Come in there!&rsquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      An irrepressible exclamation burst from the lips of Jonas, as Lewsome
      entered at the door. It was not a groan, or a shriek, or a word, but was
      wholly unlike any sound that had ever fallen on the ears of those who
      heard it, while at the same time it was the most sharp and terrible
      expression of what was working in his guilty breast, that nature could
      have invented.
    </p>
    <p>
      He had done murder for this! He had girdled himself about with perils,
      agonies of mind, innumerable fears, for this! He had hidden his secret in
      the wood; pressed and stamped it down into the bloody ground; and here it
      started up when least expected, miles upon miles away; known to many;
      proclaiming itself from the lips of an old man who had renewed his
      strength and vigour as by a miracle, to give it voice against him!
    </p>
    <p>
      He leaned his hand on the back of a chair, and looked at them. It was in
      vain to try to do so scornfully, or with his usual insolence. He required
      the chair for his support. But he made a struggle for it.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;I know that fellow,&rsquo; he said, fetching his breath at every word, and
      pointing his trembling finger towards Lewsome. &lsquo;He&rsquo;s the greatest liar
      alive. What&rsquo;s his last tale? Ha, ha! You&rsquo;re rare fellows, too! Why, that
      uncle of mine is childish; he&rsquo;s even a greater child than his brother, my
      father, was, in his old age; or than Chuffey is. What the devil do you
      mean,&rsquo; he added, looking fiercely at John Westlock and Mark Tapley (the
      latter had entered with Lewsome), &lsquo;by coming here, and bringing two idiots
      and a knave with you to take my house by storm? Hallo, there! Open the
      door! Turn these strangers out!&rsquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;I tell you what,&rsquo; cried Mr Tapley, coming forward, &lsquo;if it wasn&rsquo;t for your
      name, I&rsquo;d drag you through the streets of my own accord, and single-handed
      I would! Ah, I would! Don&rsquo;t try and look bold at me. You can&rsquo;t do it! Now
      go on, sir,&rsquo; this was to old Martin. &lsquo;Bring the murderin&rsquo; wagabond upon
      his knees! If he wants noise, he shall have enough of it; for as sure as
      he&rsquo;s a shiverin&rsquo; from head to foot I&rsquo;ll raise a uproar at this winder that
      shall bring half London in. Go on, sir! Let him try me once, and see
      whether I&rsquo;m a man of my word or not.&rsquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      With that, Mark folded his arms, and took his seat upon the window-ledge,
      with an air of general preparation for anything, which seemed to imply
      that he was equally ready to jump out himself, or to throw Jonas out, upon
      receiving the slightest hint that it would be agreeable to the company.
    </p>
    <p>
      Old Martin turned to Lewsome:
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;This is the man,&rsquo; he said, extending his hand towards Jonas. &lsquo;Is it?&rsquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;You need do no more than look at him to be sure of that, or of the truth
      of what I have said,&rsquo; was the reply. &lsquo;He is my witness.&rsquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Oh, brother!&rsquo; cried old Martin, clasping his hands and lifting up his
      eyes. &lsquo;Oh, brother, brother! Were we strangers half our lives that you
      might breed a wretch like this, and I make life a desert by withering
      every flower that grew about me! Is it the natural end of your precepts
      and mine, that this should be the creature of your rearing, training,
      teaching, hoarding, striving for; and I the means of bringing him to
      punishment, when nothing can repair the wasted past!&rsquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      He sat down upon a chair as he spoke, and turning away his face, was
      silent for a few moments. Then with recovered energy he proceeded:
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;But the accursed harvest of our mistaken lives shall be trodden down. It
      is not too late for that. You are confronted with this man, you monster
      there; not to be spared, but to be dealt with justly. Hear what he says!
      Reply, be silent, contradict, repeat, defy, do what you please. My course
      will be the same. Go on! And you,&rsquo; he said to Chuffey, &lsquo;for the love of
      your old friend, speak out, good fellow!&rsquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;I have been silent for his love!&rsquo; cried the old man. &lsquo;He urged me to it.
      He made me promise it upon his dying bed. I never would have spoken, but
      for your finding out so much. I have thought about it ever since; I
      couldn&rsquo;t help that; and sometimes I have had it all before me in a dream;
      but in the day-time, not in sleep. Is there such a kind of dream?&rsquo; said
      Chuffey, looking anxiously in old Martin&rsquo;s face.
    </p>
    <p>
      As Martin made him an encouraging reply, he listened attentively to his
      voice, and smiled.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Ah, aye!&rsquo; he cried. &lsquo;He often spoke to me like that. We were at school
      together, he and I. I couldn&rsquo;t turn against his son, you know&mdash;his
      only son, Mr Chuzzlewit!&rsquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;I would to Heaven you had been his son!&rsquo; said Martin.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;You speak so like my dear old master,&rsquo; cried the old man with a childish
      delight, &lsquo;that I almost think I hear him. I can hear you quite as well as
      I used to hear him. It makes me young again. He never spoke unkindly to
      me, and I always understood him. I could always see him too, though my
      sight was dim. Well, well! He&rsquo;s dead, he&rsquo;s dead. He was very good to me,
      my dear old master!&rsquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      He shook his head mournfully over the brother&rsquo;s hand. At this moment Mark,
      who had been glancing out of the window, left the room.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;I couldn&rsquo;t turn against his only son, you know,&rsquo; said Chuffey. &lsquo;He has
      nearly driven me to do it sometimes; he very nearly did tonight. Ah!&rsquo;
      cried the old man, with a sudden recollection of the cause. &lsquo;Where is she?
      She&rsquo;s not come home!&rsquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Do you mean his wife?&rsquo; said Mr Chuzzlewit.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Yes.&rsquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;I have removed her. She is in my care, and will be spared the present
      knowledge of what is passing here. She has known misery enough, without
      that addition.&rsquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      Jonas heard this with a sinking heart. He knew that they were on his
      heels, and felt that they were resolute to run him to destruction. Inch by
      inch the ground beneath him was sliding from his feet; faster and faster
      the encircling ruin contracted and contracted towards himself, its wicked
      centre, until it should close in and crush him.
    </p>
    <p>
      And now he heard the voice of his accomplice stating to his face, with
      every circumstance of time and place and incident; and openly proclaiming,
      with no reserve, suppression, passion, or concealment; all the truth. The
      truth, which nothing would keep down; which blood would not smother, and
      earth would not hide; the truth, whose terrible inspiration seemed to
      change dotards into strong men; and on whose avenging wings, one whom he
      had supposed to be at the extremest corner of the earth came swooping down
      upon him.
    </p>
    <p>
      He tried to deny it, but his tongue would not move. He conceived some
      desperate thought of rushing away, and tearing through the streets; but
      his limbs would as little answer to his will as his stark, stiff staring
      face. All this time the voice went slowly on, denouncing him. It was as if
      every drop of blood in the wood had found a voice to jeer him with.
    </p>
    <p>
      When it ceased, another voice took up the tale, but strangely; for the old
      clerk, who had watched, and listened to the whole, and had wrung his hands
      from time to time, as if he knew its truth and could confirm it, broke in
      with these words:
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;No, no, no! you&rsquo;re wrong; you&rsquo;re wrong&mdash;all wrong together! Have
      patience, for the truth is only known to me!&rsquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;How can that be,&rsquo; said his old master&rsquo;s brother, &lsquo;after what you have
      heard? Besides, you said just now, above-stairs, when I told you of the
      accusation against him, that you knew he was his father&rsquo;s murderer.&rsquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Aye, yes! and so he was!&rsquo; cried Chuffey, wildly. &lsquo;But not as you suppose&mdash;not
      as you suppose. Stay! Give me a moment&rsquo;s time. I have it all here&mdash;all
      here! It was foul, foul, cruel, bad; but not as you suppose. Stay, stay!&rsquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      He put his hands up to his head, as if it throbbed or pained him. After
      looking about him in a wandering and vacant manner for some moments, his
      eyes rested upon Jonas, when they kindled up with sudden recollection and
      intelligence.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Yes!&rsquo; cried old Chuffey, &lsquo;yes! That&rsquo;s how it was. It&rsquo;s all upon me now.
      He&mdash;he got up from his bed before he died, to be sure, to say that he
      forgave him; and he came down with me into this room; and when he saw him&mdash;his
      only son, the son he loved&mdash;his speech forsook him; he had no speech
      for what he knew&mdash;and no one understood him except me. But I did&mdash;I
      did!&rsquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      Old Martin regarded him in amazement; so did his companions. Mrs Gamp, who
      had said nothing yet; but had kept two-thirds of herself behind the door,
      ready for escape, and one-third in the room, ready for siding with the
      strongest party; came a little further in and remarked, with a sob, that
      Mr Chuffey was &lsquo;the sweetest old creetur goin&rsquo;.&rsquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;He bought the stuff,&rsquo; said Chuffey, stretching out his arm towards Jonas
      while an unwonted fire shone in his eye, and lightened up his face; &lsquo;he
      bought the stuff, no doubt, as you have heard, and brought it home. He
      mixed the stuff&mdash;look at him!&mdash;with some sweetmeat in a jar,
      exactly as the medicine for his father&rsquo;s cough was mixed, and put it in a
      drawer; in that drawer yonder in the desk; he knows which drawer I mean!
      He kept it there locked up. But his courage failed him or his heart was
      touched&mdash;my God! I hope it was his heart! He was his only son!&mdash;and
      he did not put it in the usual place, where my old master would have taken
      it twenty times a day.&rsquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      The trembling figure of the old man shook with the strong emotions that
      possessed him. But, with the same light in his eye, and with his arm
      outstretched, and with his grey hair stirring on his head, he seemed to
      grow in size, and was like a man inspired. Jonas shrunk from looking at
      him, and cowered down into the chair by which he had held. It seemed as if
      this tremendous Truth could make the dumb speak.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;I know it every word now!&rsquo; cried Chuffey. &lsquo;Every word! He put it in that
      drawer, as I have said. He went so often there, and was so secret, that
      his father took notice of it; and when he was out, had it opened. We were
      there together, and we found the mixture&mdash;Mr Chuzzlewit and I. He
      took it into his possession, and made light of it at the time; but in the
      night he came to my bedside, weeping, and told me that his own son had it
      in his mind to poison him. &ldquo;Oh, Chuff,&rdquo; he said, &ldquo;oh, dear old Chuff! a
      voice came into my room to-night, and told me that this crime began with
      me. It began when I taught him to be too covetous of what I have to leave,
      and made the expectation of it his great business!&rdquo; Those were his words;
      aye, they are his very words! If he was a hard man now and then, it was
      for his only son. He loved his only son, and he was always good to me!&rsquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      Jonas listened with increased attention. Hope was breaking in upon him.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;&ldquo;He shall not weary for my death, Chuff;&rdquo; that was what he said next,&rsquo;
      pursued the old clerk, as he wiped his eyes; &lsquo;that was what he said next,
      crying like a little child: &ldquo;He shall not weary for my death, Chuff. He
      shall have it now; he shall marry where he has a fancy, Chuff, although it
      don&rsquo;t please me; and you and I will go away and live upon a little. I
      always loved him; perhaps he&rsquo;ll love me then. It&rsquo;s a dreadful thing to
      have my own child thirsting for my death. But I might have known it. I
      have sown, and I must reap. He shall believe that I am taking this; and
      when I see that he is sorry, and has all he wants, I&rsquo;ll tell him that I
      found it out, and I&rsquo;ll forgive him. He&rsquo;ll make a better man of his own
      son, and be a better man himself, perhaps, Chuff!&rdquo;&rsquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      Poor Chuffey paused to dry his eyes again. Old Martin&rsquo;s face was hidden in
      his hands. Jonas listened still more keenly, and his breast heaved like a
      swollen water, but with hope. With growing hope.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;My dear old master made believe next day,&rsquo; said Chuffey, &lsquo;that he had
      opened the drawer by mistake with a key from the bunch, which happened to
      fit it (we had one made and hung upon it); and that he had been surprised
      to find his fresh supply of cough medicine in such a place, but supposed
      it had been put there in a hurry when the drawer stood open. We burnt it;
      but his son believed that he was taking it&mdash;he knows he did. Once Mr
      Chuzzlewit, to try him, took heart to say it had a strange taste; and he
      got up directly, and went out.&rsquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      Jonas gave a short, dry cough; and, changing his position for an easier
      one, folded his arms without looking at them, though they could now see
      his face.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Mr Chuzzlewit wrote to her father; I mean the father of the poor thing
      who&rsquo;s his wife,&rsquo; said Chuffey; &lsquo;and got him to come up, intending to
      hasten on the marriage. But his mind, like mine, went a little wrong
      through grief, and then his heart broke. He sank and altered from the time
      when he came to me in the night; and never held up his head again. It was
      only a few days, but he had never changed so much in twice the years.
      &ldquo;Spare him, Chuff!&rdquo; he said, before he died. They were the only words he
      could speak. &ldquo;Spare him, Chuff!&rdquo; I promised him I would. I&rsquo;ve tried to do
      it. He&rsquo;s his only son.&rsquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      On his recollection of the last scene in his old friend&rsquo;s life, poor
      Chuffey&rsquo;s voice, which had grown weaker and weaker, quite deserted him.
      Making a motion with his hand, as if he would have said that Anthony had
      taken it, and had died with it in his, he retreated to the corner where he
      usually concealed his sorrows; and was silent.
    </p>
    <p>
      Jonas could look at his company now, and vauntingly too. &lsquo;Well!&rsquo; he said,
      after a pause. &lsquo;Are you satisfied? or have you any more of your plots to
      broach? Why that fellow, Lewsome, can invent &lsquo;em for you by the score. Is
      this all? Have you nothing else?&rsquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      Old Martin looked at him steadily.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Whether you are what you seemed to be at Pecksniff&rsquo;s, or are something
      else and a mountebank, I don&rsquo;t know and I don&rsquo;t care,&rsquo; said Jonas, looking
      downward with a smile, &lsquo;but I don&rsquo;t want you here. You were here so often
      when your brother was alive, and were always so fond of him (your dear,
      dear brother, and you would have been cuffing one another before this,
      ecod!), that I am not surprised at your being attached to the place; but
      the place is not attached to you, and you can&rsquo;t leave it too soon, though
      you may leave it too late. And for my wife, old man, send her home
      straight, or it will be the worse for her. Ha, ha! You carry it with a
      high hand, too! But it isn&rsquo;t hanging yet for a man to keep a penn&rsquo;orth of
      poison for his own purposes, and have it taken from him by two old crazy
      jolter-heads who go and act a play about it. Ha, ha! Do you see the door?&rsquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      His base triumph, struggling with his cowardice, and shame, and guilt, was
      so detestable, that they turned away from him, as if he were some obscene
      and filthy animal, repugnant to the sight. And here that last black crime
      was busy with him too; working within him to his perdition. But for that,
      the old clerk&rsquo;s story might have touched him, though never so lightly; but
      for that, the sudden removal of so great a load might have brought about
      some wholesome change even in him. With that deed done, however; with that
      unnecessary wasteful danger haunting him; despair was in his very triumph
      and relief; wild, ungovernable, raging despair, for the uselessness of the
      peril into which he had plunged; despair that hardened him and maddened
      him, and set his teeth a-grinding in a moment of his exultation.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;My good friend!&rsquo; said old Martin, laying his hand on Chuffey&rsquo;s sleeve.
      &lsquo;This is no place for you to remain in. Come with me.&rsquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Just his old way!&rsquo; cried Chuffey, looking up into his face. &lsquo;I almost
      believe it&rsquo;s Mr Chuzzlewit alive again. Yes! Take me with you! Stay,
      though, stay.&rsquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;For what?&rsquo; asked old Martin.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;I can&rsquo;t leave her, poor thing!&rsquo; said Chuffey. &lsquo;She has been very good to
      me. I can&rsquo;t leave her, Mr Chuzzlewit. Thank you kindly. I&rsquo;ll remain here.
      I haven&rsquo;t long to remain; it&rsquo;s no great matter.&rsquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      As he meekly shook his poor, grey head, and thanked old Martin in these
      words, Mrs Gamp, now entirely in the room, was affected to tears.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;The mercy as it is!&rsquo; she said, &lsquo;as sech a dear, good, reverend creetur
      never got into the clutches of Betsey Prig, which but for me he would have
      done, undoubted; facts bein&rsquo; stubborn and not easy drove!&rsquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;You heard me speak to you just now, old man,&rsquo; said Jonas to his uncle.
      &lsquo;I&rsquo;ll have no more tampering with my people, man or woman. Do you see the
      door?&rsquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Do <i>you </i>see the door?&rsquo; returned the voice of Mark, coming from that
      direction. &lsquo;Look at it!&rsquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      He looked, and his gaze was nailed there. Fatal, ill-omened blighted
      threshold, cursed by his father&rsquo;s footsteps in his dying hour, cursed by
      his young wife&rsquo;s sorrowing tread, cursed by the daily shadow of the old
      clerk&rsquo;s figure, cursed by the crossing of his murderer&rsquo;s feet&mdash;what
      men were standing in the door way!
    </p>
    <p>
      Nadgett foremost.
    </p>
    <p>
      Hark! It came on, roaring like a sea! Hawkers burst into the street,
      crying it up and down; windows were thrown open that the inhabitants might
      hear it; people stopped to listen in the road and on the pavement; the
      bells, the same bells, began to ring; tumbling over one another in a dance
      of boisterous joy at the discovery (that was the sound they had in his
      distempered thoughts), and making their airy play-ground rock.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;That is the man,&rsquo; said Nadgett. &lsquo;By the window!&rsquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      Three others came in, laid hands upon him, and secured him. It was so
      quickly done, that he had not lost sight of the informer&rsquo;s face for an
      instant when his wrists were manacled together.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Murder,&rsquo; said Nadgett, looking round on the astonished group. &lsquo;Let no one
      interfere.&rsquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      The sounding street repeated Murder; barbarous and dreadful Murder.
      Murder, Murder, Murder. Rolling on from house to house, and echoing from
      stone to stone, until the voices died away into the distant hum, which
      seemed to mutter the same word!
    </p>
    <p>
      They all stood silent: listening, and gazing in each other&rsquo;s faces, as the
      noise passed on.
    </p>
    <p>
      Old Martin was the first to speak. &lsquo;What terrible history is this?&rsquo; he
      demanded.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Ask <i>him</i>,&rsquo; said Nadgett. &lsquo;You&rsquo;re his friend, sir. He can tell you, if he
      will. He knows more of it than I do, though I know much.&rsquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;How do you know much?&rsquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;I have not been watching him so long for nothing,&rsquo; returned Nadgett. &lsquo;I
      never watched a man so close as I have watched him.&rsquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      Another of the phantom forms of this terrific Truth! Another of the many
      shapes in which it started up about him, out of vacancy. This man, of all
      men in the world, a spy upon him; this man, changing his identity; casting
      off his shrinking, purblind, unobservant character, and springing up into
      a watchful enemy! The dead man might have come out of his grave, and not
      confounded and appalled him more.
    </p>
    <p>
      The game was up. The race was at an end; the rope was woven for his neck.
      If, by a miracle, he could escape from this strait, he had but to turn his
      face another way, no matter where, and there would rise some new avenger
      front to front with him; some infant in an hour grown old, or old man in
      an hour grown young, or blind man with his sight restored, or deaf man
      with his hearing given him. There was no chance. He sank down in a heap
      against the wall, and never hoped again from that moment.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;I am not his friend, although I have the honour to be his relative,&rsquo; said
      Mr Chuzzlewit. &lsquo;You may speak to me. Where have you watched, and what have
      you seen?&rsquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;I have watched in many places,&rsquo; returned Nadgett, &lsquo;night and day. I have
      watched him lately, almost without rest or relief;&rsquo; his anxious face and
      bloodshot eyes confirmed it. &lsquo;I little thought to what my watching was to
      lead. As little as he did when he slipped out in the night, dressed in
      those clothes which he afterwards sunk in a bundle at London Bridge!&rsquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      Jonas moved upon the ground like a man in bodily torture. He uttered a
      suppressed groan, as if he had been wounded by some cruel weapon; and
      plucked at the iron band upon his wrists, as though (his hands being free)
      he would have torn himself.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Steady, kinsman!&rsquo; said the chief officer of the party. &lsquo;Don&rsquo;t be
      violent.&rsquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Whom do you call kinsman?&rsquo; asked old Martin sternly.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;You,&rsquo; said the man, &lsquo;among others.&rsquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      Martin turned his scrutinizing gaze upon him. He was sitting lazily across
      a chair with his arms resting on the back; eating nuts, and throwing the
      shells out of window as he cracked them, which he still continued to do
      while speaking.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Aye,&rsquo; he said, with a sulky nod. &lsquo;You may deny your nephews till you die;
      but Chevy Slyme is Chevy Slyme still, all the world over. Perhaps even you
      may feel it some disgrace to your own blood to be employed in this way.
      I&rsquo;m to be bought off.&rsquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;At every turn!&rsquo; cried Martin. &lsquo;Self, self, self. Every one among them for
      himself!&rsquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;You had better save one or two among them the trouble then and be for
      them as well as <i>your</i>self,&rsquo; replied his nephew. &lsquo;Look here at me! Can you
      see the man of your family who has more talent in his little finger than
      all the rest in their united brains, dressed as a police officer without
      being ashamed? I took up with this trade on purpose to shame you. I didn&rsquo;t
      think I should have to make a capture in the family, though.&rsquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;If your debauchery, and that of your chosen friends, has really brought
      you to this level,&rsquo; returned the old man, &lsquo;keep it. You are living
      honestly, I hope, and that&rsquo;s something.&rsquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Don&rsquo;t be hard upon my chosen friends,&rsquo; returned Slyme, &lsquo;for they were
      sometimes your chosen friends too. Don&rsquo;t say you never employed my friend
      Tigg, for I know better. We quarrelled upon it.&rsquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;I hired the fellow,&rsquo; retorted Mr Chuzzlewit, &lsquo;and I paid him.&rsquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;It&rsquo;s well you paid him,&rsquo; said his nephew, &lsquo;for it would be too late to do
      so now. He has given his receipt in full; or had it forced from him
      rather.&rsquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      The old man looked at him as if he were curious to know what he meant, but
      scorned to prolong the conversation.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;I have always expected that he and I would be brought together again in
      the course of business,&rsquo; said Slyme, taking a fresh handful of nuts from
      his pocket; &lsquo;but I thought he would be wanted for some swindling job; it
      never entered my head that I should hold a warrant for the apprehension of
      his murderer.&rsquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;<i>His </i>murderer!&rsquo; cried Mr Chuzzlewit, looking from one to another.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;His or Mr Montague&rsquo;s,&rsquo; said Nadgett. &lsquo;They are the same, I am told. I
      accuse him yonder of the murder of Mr Montague, who was found last night,
      killed, in a wood. You will ask me why I accuse him as you have already
      asked me how I know so much. I&rsquo;ll tell you. It can&rsquo;t remain a secret
      long.&rsquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      The ruling passion of the man expressed itself even then, in the tone of
      regret in which he deplored the approaching publicity of what he knew.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;I told you I had watched him,&rsquo; he proceeded. &lsquo;I was instructed to do so
      by Mr Montague, in whose employment I have been for some time. We had our
      suspicions of him; and you know what they pointed at, for you have been
      discussing it since we have been waiting here, outside the room. If you
      care to hear, now it&rsquo;s all over, in what our suspicions began, I&rsquo;ll tell
      you plainly: in a quarrel (it first came to our ears through a hint of his
      own) between him and another office in which his father&rsquo;s life was
      insured, and which had so much doubt and distrust upon the subject, that
      he compounded with them, and took half the money; and was glad to do it.
      Bit by bit, I ferreted out more circumstances against him, and not a few.
      It required a little patience, but it&rsquo;s my calling. I found the nurse&mdash;here
      she is to confirm me; I found the doctor, I found the undertaker, I found
      the undertaker&rsquo;s man. I found out how the old gentleman there, Mr Chuffey,
      had behaved at the funeral; and I found out what this man,&rsquo; touching
      Lewsome on the arm, &lsquo;had talked about in his fever. I found out how he
      conducted himself before his father&rsquo;s death, and how since and how at the
      time; and writing it all down, and putting it carefully together, made
      case enough for Mr Montague to tax him with the crime, which (as he
      himself believed until to-night) he had committed. I was by when this was
      done. You see him now. He is only worse than he was then.&rsquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      Oh, miserable, miserable fool! oh, insupportable, excruciating torture! To
      find alive and active&mdash;a party to it all&mdash;the brain and
      right-hand of the secret he had thought to crush! In whom, though he had
      walled the murdered man up, by enchantment in a rock, the story would have
      lived and walked abroad! He tried to stop his ears with his fettered arms,
      that he might shut out the rest.
    </p>
    <p>
      As he crouched upon the floor, they drew away from him as if a pestilence
      were in his breath. They fell off, one by one, from that part of the room,
      leaving him alone upon the ground. Even those who had him in their keeping
      shunned him, and (with the exception of Slyme, who was still occupied with
      his nuts) kept apart.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;From that garret-window opposite,&rsquo; said Nadgett, pointing across the
      narrow street, &lsquo;I have watched this house and him for days and nights.
      From that garret-window opposite I saw him return home, alone, from a
      journey on which he had set out with Mr Montague. That was my token that
      Mr Montague&rsquo;s end was gained; and I might rest easy on my watch, though I
      was not to leave it until he dismissed me. But, standing at the door
      opposite, after dark that same night, I saw a countryman steal out of this
      house, by a side-door in the court, who had never entered it. I knew his
      walk, and that it was himself, disguised. I followed him immediately. I
      lost him on the western road, still travelling westward.&rsquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      Jonas looked up at him for an instant, and muttered an oath.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;I could not comprehend what this meant,&rsquo; said Nadgett; &lsquo;but, having seen
      so much, I resolved to see it out, and through. And I did. Learning, on
      inquiry at his house from his wife, that he was supposed to be sleeping in
      the room from which I had seen him go out, and that he had given strict
      orders not to be disturbed, I knew that he was coming back; and for his
      coming back I watched. I kept my watch in the street&mdash;in doorways,
      and such places&mdash;all that night; at the same window, all next day;
      and when night came on again, in the street once more. For I knew he would
      come back, as he had gone out, when this part of the town was empty. He
      did. Early in the morning, the same countryman came creeping, creeping,
      creeping home.&rsquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Look sharp!&rsquo; interposed Slyme, who had now finished his nuts. &lsquo;This is
      quite irregular, Mr Nadgett.&rsquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;I kept at the window all day,&rsquo; said Nadgett, without heeding him. &lsquo;I
      think I never closed my eyes. At night, I saw him come out with a bundle.
      I followed him again. He went down the steps at London Bridge, and sunk it
      in the river. I now began to entertain some serious fears, and made a
      communication to the Police, which caused that bundle to be&mdash;&rsquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;To be fished up,&rsquo; interrupted Slyme. &lsquo;Be alive, Mr Nadgett.&rsquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;It contained the dress I had seen him wear,&rsquo; said Nadgett; &lsquo;stained with
      clay, and spotted with blood. Information of the murder was received in
      town last night. The wearer of that dress is already known to have been
      seen near the place; to have been lurking in that neighbourhood; and to
      have alighted from a coach coming from that part of the country, at a time
      exactly tallying with the very minute when I saw him returning home. The
      warrant has been out, and these officers have been with me, some hours. We
      chose our time; and seeing you come in, and seeing this person at the
      window&mdash;&rsquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Beckoned to him,&rsquo; said Mark, taking up the thread of the narrative, on
      hearing this allusion to himself, &lsquo;to open the door; which he did with a
      deal of pleasure.&rsquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;That&rsquo;s all at present,&rsquo; said Nadgett, putting up his great pocketbook,
      which from mere habit he had produced when he began his revelation, and
      had kept in his hand all the time; &lsquo;but there is plenty more to come. You
      asked me for the facts, so far I have related them, and need not detain
      these gentlemen any longer. Are you ready, Mr Slyme?&rsquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;And something more,&rsquo; replied that worthy, rising. &lsquo;If you walk round to
      the office, we shall be there as soon as you. Tom! Get a coach!&rsquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      The officer to whom he spoke departed for that purpose. Old Martin
      lingered for a few moments, as if he would have addressed some words to
      Jonas; but looking round, and seeing him still seated on the floor,
      rocking himself in a savage manner to and fro, took Chuffey&rsquo;s arm, and
      slowly followed Nadgett out. John Westlock and Mark Tapley accompanied
      them. Mrs Gamp had tottered out first, for the better display of her
      feelings, in a kind of walking swoon; for Mrs Gamp performed swoons of
      different sorts, upon a moderate notice, as Mr Mould did Funerals.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Ha!&rsquo; muttered Slyme, looking after them. &lsquo;Upon my soul! As insensible of
      being disgraced by having such a nephew as myself, in such a situation, as
      he was of my being an honour and a credit to the family! That&rsquo;s the return
      I get for having humbled my spirit&mdash;such a spirit as mine&mdash;to
      earn a livelihood, is it?&rsquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      He got up from his chair, and kicked it away indignantly.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;And such a livelihood too! When there are hundreds of men, not fit to
      hold a candle to me, rolling in carriages and living on their fortunes.
      Upon my soul it&rsquo;s a nice world!&rsquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      His eyes encountered Jonas, who looked earnestly towards him, and moved
      his lips as if he were whispering.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Eh?&rsquo; said Slyme.
    </p>
    <p>
      Jonas glanced at the attendant whose back was towards him, and made a
      clumsy motion with his bound hands towards the door.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Humph!&rsquo; said Slyme, thoughtfully. &lsquo;I couldn&rsquo;t hope to disgrace him into
      anything when you have shot so far ahead of me though. I forgot that.&rsquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      Jonas repeated the same look and gesture.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Jack!&rsquo; said Slyme.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Hallo!&rsquo; returned his man.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Go down to the door, ready for the coach. Call out when it comes. I&rsquo;d
      rather have you there. Now then,&rsquo; he added, turning hastily to Jonas, when
      the man was gone. &lsquo;What&rsquo;s the matter?&rsquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      Jonas essayed to rise.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Stop a bit,&rsquo; said Slyme. &lsquo;It&rsquo;s not so easy when your wrists are tight
      together. Now then! Up! What is it?&rsquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Put your hand in my pocket. Here! The breast pocket, on the left!&rsquo; said
      Jonas.
    </p>
    <p>
      He did so; and drew out a purse.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;There&rsquo;s a hundred pound in it,&rsquo; said Jonas, whose words were almost
      unintelligible; as his face, in its pallor and agony, was scarcely human.
    </p>
    <p>
      Slyme looked at him; gave it into his hands; and shook his head.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;I can&rsquo;t. I daren&rsquo;t. I couldn&rsquo;t if I dared. Those fellows below&mdash;&rsquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Escape&rsquo;s impossible,&rsquo; said Jonas. &lsquo;I know it. One hundred pound for only
      five minutes in the next room!&rsquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;What to do?&rsquo; he asked.
    </p>
    <p>
      The face of his prisoner as he advanced to whisper in his ear, made him
      recoil involuntarily. But he stopped and listened to him. The words were
      few, but his own face changed as he heard them.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;I have it about me,&rsquo; said Jonas, putting his hands to his throat, as
      though whatever he referred to were hidden in his neckerchief. &lsquo;How should
      you know of it? How could you know? A hundred pound for only five minutes
      in the next room! The time&rsquo;s passing. Speak!&rsquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;It would be more&mdash;more creditable to the family,&rsquo; observed Slyme,
      with trembling lips. &lsquo;I wish you hadn&rsquo;t told me half so much. Less would
      have served your purpose. You might have kept it to yourself.&rsquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;A hundred pound for only five minutes in the next room! Speak!&rsquo; cried
      Jonas, desperately.
    </p>
    <p>
      He took the purse. Jonas, with a wild unsteady step, retreated to the door
      in the glass partition.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Stop!&rsquo; cried Slyme, catching at his skirts. &lsquo;I don&rsquo;t know about this. Yet
      it must end so at last. Are you guilty?&rsquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Yes!&rsquo; said Jonas.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Are the proofs as they were told just now?&rsquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Yes!&rsquo; said Jonas.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Will you&mdash;will you engage to say a&mdash;a Prayer, now, or something
      of that sort?&rsquo; faltered Slyme.
    </p>
    <p>
      Jonas broke from him without replying, and closed the door between them.
    </p>
    <p>
      Slyme listened at the keyhole. After that, he crept away on tiptoe, as far
      off as he could; and looked awfully towards the place. He was roused by
      the arrival of the coach, and their letting down the steps.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;He&rsquo;s getting a few things together,&rsquo; he said, leaning out of window, and
      speaking to the two men below, who stood in the full light of a
      street-lamp. &lsquo;Keep your eye upon the back, one of you, for form&rsquo;s sake.&rsquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      One of the men withdrew into the court. The other, seating himself self on
      the steps of the coach, remained in conversation with Slyme at the window
      who perhaps had risen to be his superior, in virtue of his old propensity
      (one so much lauded by the murdered man) of being always round the corner.
      A useful habit in his present calling.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Where is he?&rsquo; asked the man.
    </p>
    <p>
      Slyme looked into the room for an instant and gave his head a jerk as much
      as to say, &lsquo;Close at hand. I see him.&rsquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;He&rsquo;s booked,&rsquo; observed the man.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Through,&rsquo; said Slyme.
    </p>
    <p>
      They looked at each other, and up and down the street. The man on the
      coach-steps took his hat off, and put it on again, and whistled a little.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;I say! He&rsquo;s taking his time!&rsquo; he remonstrated.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;I allowed him five minutes,&rsquo; said Slyme. &lsquo;Time&rsquo;s more than up, though.
      I&rsquo;ll bring him down.&rsquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      He withdrew from the window accordingly, and walked on tiptoe to the door
      in the partition. He listened. There was not a sound within. He set the
      candles near it, that they might shine through the glass.
    </p>
    <p>
      It was not easy, he found, to make up his mind to the opening of the door.
      But he flung it wide open suddenly, and with a noise; then retreated.
      After peeping in and listening again, he entered.
    </p>
    <p>
      He started back as his eyes met those of Jonas, standing in an angle of
      the wall, and staring at him. His neckerchief was off; his face was ashy
      pale.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;You&rsquo;re too soon,&rsquo; said Jonas, with an abject whimper. &lsquo;I&rsquo;ve not had time.
      I have not been able to do it. I&mdash;five minutes more&mdash;two minutes
      more!&mdash;only one!&rsquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      Slyme gave him no reply, but thrusting the purse upon him and forcing it
      back into his pocket, called up his men.
    </p>
    <p>
      He whined, and cried, and cursed, and entreated them, and struggled, and
      submitted, in the same breath, and had no power to stand. They got him
      away and into the coach, where they put him on a seat; but he soon fell
      moaning down among the straw at the bottom, and lay there.
    </p>
    <p>
      The two men were with him. Slyme being on the box with the driver; and
      they let him lie. Happening to pass a fruiterer&rsquo;s on their way; the door
      of which was open, though the shop was by this time shut; one of them
      remarked how faint the peaches smelled.
    </p>
    <p>
      The other assented at the moment, but presently stooped down in quick
      alarm, and looked at the prisoner.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Stop the coach! He has poisoned himself! The smell comes from this bottle
      in his hand!&rsquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      The hand had shut upon it tight. With that rigidity of grasp with which no
      living man, in the full strength and energy of life, can clutch a prize he
      has won.
    </p>
    <p>
      They dragged him out into the dark street; but jury, judge, and hangman,
      could have done no more, and could do nothing now. Dead, dead, dead.

      CHAPTER FIFTY-TWO
    </h2>
    <h3>
      IN WHICH THE TABLES ARE TURNED, COMPLETELY UPSIDE DOWN
    </h3>
    <p>
      Old Martin&rsquo;s cherished projects, so long hidden in his own breast, so
      frequently in danger of abrupt disclosure through the bursting forth of
      the indignation he had hoarded up during his residence with Mr Pecksniff,
      were retarded, but not beyond a few hours, by the occurrences just now
      related. Stunned, as he had been at first by the intelligence conveyed to
      him through Tom Pinch and John Westlock, of the supposed manner of his
      brother&rsquo;s death; overwhelmed as he was by the subsequent narratives of
      Chuffey and Nadgett, and the forging of that chain of circumstances ending
      in the death of Jonas, of which catastrophe he was immediately informed;
      scattered as his purposes and hopes were for the moment, by the crowding
      in of all these incidents between him and his end; still their very
      intensity and the tumult of their assemblage nerved him to the rapid and
      unyielding execution of his scheme. In every single circumstance, whether
      it were cruel, cowardly, or false, he saw the flowering of the same
      pregnant seed. Self; grasping, eager, narrow-ranging, overreaching self;
      with its long train of suspicions, lusts, deceits, and all their growing
      consequences; was the root of the vile tree. Mr Pecksniff had so presented
      his character before the old man&rsquo;s eyes, that he&mdash;the good, the
      tolerant, enduring Pecksniff&mdash;had become the incarnation of all
      selfishness and treachery; and the more odious the shapes in which those
      vices ranged themselves before him now, the sterner consolation he had in
      his design of setting Mr Pecksniff right and Mr Pecksniff&rsquo;s victims too.
    </p>
    <p>
      To this work he brought, not only the energy and determination natural to
      his character (which, as the reader may have observed in the beginning of
      his or her acquaintance with this gentleman, was remarkable for the strong
      development of those qualities), but all the forced and unnaturally
      nurtured energy consequent upon their long suppression. And these two
      tides of resolution setting into one and sweeping on, became so strong and
      vigorous, that, to prevent themselves from being carried away before it,
      Heaven knows where, was as much as John Westlock and Mark Tapley together
      (though they were tolerably energetic too) could manage to effect.
    </p>
    <p>
      He had sent for John Westlock immediately on his arrival; and John, under
      the conduct of Tom Pinch, had waited on him. Having a lively recollection
      of Mr Tapley, he had caused that gentleman&rsquo;s attendance to be secured,
      through John&rsquo;s means, without delay; and thus, as we have seen, they had
      all repaired together to the City. But his grandson he had refused to see
      until to-morrow, when Mr Tapley was instructed to summon him to the Temple
      at ten o&rsquo;clock in the forenoon. Tom he would not allow to be employed in
      anything, lest he should be wrongfully suspected; but he was a party to
      all their proceedings, and was with them until late at night&mdash;until
      after they knew of the death of Jonas; when he went home to tell all these
      wonders to little Ruth, and to prepare her for accompanying him to the
      Temple in the morning, agreeably to Mr Chuzzlewit&rsquo;s particular injunction.
    </p>
    <p>
      It was characteristic of old Martin, and his looking on to something which
      he had distinctly before him, that he communicated to them nothing of his
      intentions, beyond such hints of reprisal on Mr Pecksniff as they gathered
      from the game he had played in that gentleman&rsquo;s house, and the brightening
      of his eyes whenever his name was mentioned. Even to John Westlock, in
      whom he was evidently disposed to place great confidence (which may indeed
      be said of every one of them), he gave no explanation whatever. He merely
      requested him to return in the morning; and with this for their utmost
      satisfaction, they left him, when the night was far advanced, alone.
    </p>
    <p>
      The events of such a day might have worn out the body and spirit of a much
      younger man than he, but he sat in deep and painful meditation until the
      morning was bright. Nor did he even then seek any prolonged repose, but
      merely slumbered in his chair, until seven o&rsquo;clock, when Mr Tapley had
      appointed to come to him by his desire; and came&mdash;as fresh and clean
      and cheerful as the morning itself.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;You are punctual,&rsquo; said Mr Chuzzlewit, opening the door to him in reply
      to his light knock, which had roused him instantly.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;My wishes, sir,&rsquo; replied Mr Tapley, whose mind would appear from the
      context to have been running on the matrimonial service, &lsquo;is to love,
      honour, and obey. The clock&rsquo;s a-striking now, sir.&rsquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Come in!&rsquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Thank&rsquo;ee, sir,&rsquo; rejoined Mr Tapley, &lsquo;what could I do for you first, sir?&rsquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;You gave my message to Martin?&rsquo; said the old man, bending his eyes upon
      him.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;I did, sir,&rsquo; returned Mark; &lsquo;and you never see a gentleman more surprised
      in all your born days than he was.&rsquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;What more did you tell him?&rsquo; Mr Chuzzlewit inquired.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Why, sir,&rsquo; said Mr Tapley, smiling, &lsquo;I should have liked to tell him a
      deal more, but not being able, sir, I didn&rsquo;t tell it him.&rsquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;You told him all you knew?&rsquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;But it was precious little, sir,&rsquo; retorted Mr Tapley. &lsquo;There was very
      little respectin&rsquo; you that I was able to tell him, sir. I only mentioned
      my opinion that Mr Pecksniff would find himself deceived, sir, and that
      you would find yourself deceived, and that he would find himself deceived,
      sir.&rsquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;In what?&rsquo; asked Mr Chuzzlewit.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Meaning him, sir?&rsquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Meaning both him and me.&rsquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Well, sir,&rsquo; said Mr Tapley. &lsquo;In your old opinions of each other. As to
      him, sir, and his opinions, I know he&rsquo;s a altered man. I know it. I know&rsquo;d
      it long afore he spoke to you t&rsquo;other day, and I must say it. Nobody don&rsquo;t
      know half as much of him as I do. Nobody can&rsquo;t. There was always a deal of
      good in him, but a little of it got crusted over, somehow. I can&rsquo;t say who
      rolled the paste of that &lsquo;ere crust myself, but&mdash;&rsquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Go on,&rsquo; said Martin. &lsquo;Why do you stop?&rsquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;But it&mdash;well! I beg your pardon, but I think it may have been you,
      sir. Unintentional I think it may have been you. I don&rsquo;t believe that
      neither of you gave the other quite a fair chance. There! Now I&rsquo;ve got rid
      on it,&rsquo; said Mr Tapley in a fit of desperation: &lsquo;I can&rsquo;t go a-carryin&rsquo; it
      about in my own mind, bustin&rsquo; myself with it; yesterday was quite long
      enough. It&rsquo;s out now. I can&rsquo;t help it. I&rsquo;m sorry for it. Don&rsquo;t wisit on
      him, sir, that&rsquo;s all.&rsquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      It was clear that Mark expected to be ordered out immediately, and was
      quite prepared to go.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;So you think,&rsquo; said Martin, &lsquo;that his old faults are, in some degree, of
      my creation, do you?&rsquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Well, sir,&rsquo; retorted Mr Tapley, &lsquo;I&rsquo;m werry sorry, but I can&rsquo;t unsay it.
      It&rsquo;s hardly fair of you, sir, to make a ignorant man conwict himself in
      this way, but I <i>do</i> think so. I am as respectful disposed to you, sir, as a
      man can be; but I <i>do</i> think so.&rsquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      The light of a faint smile seemed to break through the dull steadiness of
      Martin&rsquo;s face, as he looked attentively at him, without replying.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Yet you are an ignorant man, you say,&rsquo; he observed after a long pause.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Werry much so,&rsquo; Mr Tapley replied.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;And I a learned, well-instructed man, you think?&rsquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Likewise wery much so,&rsquo; Mr Tapley answered.
    </p>
    <p>
      The old man, with his chin resting on his hand, paced the room twice or
      thrice before he added:
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;You have left him this morning?&rsquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Come straight from him now, sir.&rsquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;For what does he suppose?&rsquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;He don&rsquo;t know what to suppose, sir, no more than myself. I told him jest
      wot passed yesterday, sir, and that you had said to me, &ldquo;Can you be here
      by seven in the morning?&rdquo; and that you had said to him, through me, &ldquo;Can
      you be here by ten in the morning?&rdquo; and that I had said &ldquo;Yes&rdquo; to both.
      That&rsquo;s all, sir.&rsquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      His frankness was so genuine that it plainly <i>was </i>all.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Perhaps,&rsquo; said Martin, &lsquo;he may think you are going to desert him, and to
      serve me?&rsquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;I have served him in that sort of way, sir,&rsquo; replied Mark, without the
      loss of any atom of his self-possession; &lsquo;and we have been that sort of
      companions in misfortune, that my opinion is, he don&rsquo;t believe a word on
      it. No more than you do, sir.&rsquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Will you help me to dress, and get me some breakfast from the hotel?&rsquo;
      asked Martin.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;With pleasure, sir,&rsquo; said Mark.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;And by-and-bye,&rsquo; said Martin, &lsquo;remaining in the room, as I wish you to
      do, will you attend to the door yonder&mdash;give admission to visitors, I
      mean, when they knock?&rsquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Certainly, sir,&rsquo; said Mr Tapley.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;You will not find it necessary to express surprise at their appearance,&rsquo;
      Martin suggested.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Oh dear no, sir!&rsquo; said Mr Tapley, &lsquo;not at all.&rsquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      Although he pledged himself to this with perfect confidence, he was in a
      state of unbounded astonishment even now. Martin appeared to observe it,
      and to have some sense of the ludicrous bearing of Mr Tapley under these
      perplexing circumstances; for, in spite of the composure of his voice and
      the gravity of his face, the same indistinct light flickered on the latter
      several times. Mark bestirred himself, however, to execute the offices
      with which he was entrusted; and soon lost all tendency to any outward
      expression of his surprise, in the occupation of being brisk and busy.
    </p>
    <p>
      But when he had put Mr Chuzzlewit&rsquo;s clothes in good order for dressing,
      and when that gentleman was dressed and sitting at his breakfast, Mr
      Tapley&rsquo;s feelings of wonder began to return upon him with great violence;
      and, standing beside the old man with a napkin under his arm (it was as
      natural and easy to joke to Mark to be a butler in the Temple, as it had
      been to volunteer as cook on board the Screw), he found it difficult to
      resist the temptation of casting sidelong glances at him very often. Nay,
      he found it impossible; and accordingly yielded to this impulse so often,
      that Martin caught him in the fact some fifty times. The extraordinary
      things Mr Tapley did with his own face when any of these detections
      occurred; the sudden occasions he had to rub his eyes or his nose or his
      chin; the look of wisdom with which he immediately plunged into the
      deepest thought, or became intensely interested in the habits and customs
      of the flies upon the ceiling, or the sparrows out of doors; or the
      overwhelming politeness with which he endeavoured to hide his confusion by
      handing the muffin; may not unreasonably be assumed to have exercised the
      utmost power of feature that even Martin Chuzzlewit the elder possessed.
    </p>
    <p>
      But he sat perfectly quiet and took his breakfast at his leisure, or made
      a show of doing so, for he scarcely ate or drank, and frequently lapsed
      into long intervals of musing. When he had finished, Mark sat down to his
      breakfast at the same table; and Mr Chuzzlewit, quite silent still, walked
      up and down the room.
    </p>
    <p>
      Mark cleared away in due course, and set a chair out for him, in which, as
      the time drew on towards ten o&rsquo;clock, he took his seat, leaning his hands
      upon his stick, and clenching them upon the handle, and resting his chin
      on them again. All his impatience and abstraction of manner had vanished
      now; and as he sat there, looking, with his keen eyes, steadily towards
      the door, Mark could not help thinking what a firm, square, powerful face
      it was; or exulting in the thought that Mr Pecksniff, after playing a
      pretty long game of bowls with its owner, seemed to be at last in a very
      fair way of coming in for a rubber or two.
    </p>
    <p>
      Mark&rsquo;s uncertainty in respect of what was going to be done or said, and by
      whom to whom, would have excited him in itself. But knowing for a
      certainty besides, that young Martin was coming, and in a very few minutes
      must arrive, he found it by no means easy to remain quiet and silent. But,
      excepting that he occasionally coughed in a hollow and unnatural manner to
      relieve himself, he behaved with great decorum through the longest ten
      minutes he had ever known.
    </p>
    <p>
      A knock at the door. Mr Westlock. Mr Tapley, in admitting him, raised his
      eyebrows to the highest possible pitch, implying thereby that he
      considered himself in an unsatisfactory position. Mr Chuzzlewit received
      him very courteously.
    </p>
    <p>
      Mark waited at the door for Tom Pinch and his sister, who were coming up
      the stairs. The old man went to meet them; took their hands in his; and
      kissed her on the cheek. As this looked promising, Mr Tapley smiled
      benignantly.
    </p>
    <p>
      Mr Chuzzlewit had resumed his chair before young Martin, who was close
      behind them, entered. The old man, scarcely looking at him, pointed to a
      distant seat. This was less encouraging; and Mr Tapley&rsquo;s spirits fell
      again.
    </p>
    <p>
      He was quickly summoned to the door by another knock. He did not start, or
      cry, or tumble down, at sight of Miss Graham and Mrs Lupin, but he drew a
      very long breath, and came back perfectly resigned, looking on them and on
      the rest with an expression which seemed to say that nothing could
      surprise him any more; and that he was rather glad to have done with that
      sensation for ever.
    </p>
    <p>
      The old man received Mary no less tenderly than he had received Tom
      Pinch&rsquo;s sister. A look of friendly recognition passed between himself and
      Mrs Lupin, which implied the existence of a perfect understanding between
      them. It engendered no astonishment in Mr Tapley; for, as he afterwards
      observed, he had retired from the business, and sold off the stock.
    </p>
    <p>
      Not the least curious feature in this assemblage was, that everybody
      present was so much surprised and embarrassed by the sight of everybody
      else, that nobody ventured to speak. Mr Chuzzlewit alone broke silence.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Set the door open, Mark!&rsquo; he said; &lsquo;and come here.&rsquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      Mark obeyed.
    </p>
    <p>
      The last appointed footstep sounded now upon the stairs. They all knew it.
      It was Mr Pecksniff&rsquo;s; and Mr Pecksniff was in a hurry too, for he came
      bounding up with such uncommon expedition that he stumbled twice or
      thrice.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Where is my venerable friend?&rsquo; he cried upon the upper landing; and then
      with open arms came darting in.
    </p>
    <p>
      Old Martin merely looked at him; but Mr Pecksniff started back as if he
      had received the charge from an electric battery.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;My venerable friend is well?&rsquo; cried Mr Pecksniff.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Quite well.&rsquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      It seemed to reassure the anxious inquirer. He clasped his hands and,
      looking upwards with a pious joy, silently expressed his gratitude. He
      then looked round on the assembled group, and shook his head
      reproachfully. For such a man severely, quite severely.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Oh, vermin!&rsquo; said Mr Pecksniff. &lsquo;Oh, bloodsuckers! Is it not enough that
      you have embittered the existence of an individual wholly unparalleled in
      the biographical records of amiable persons, but must you now, even now,
      when he has made his election, and reposed his trust in a Numble, but at
      least sincere and disinterested relative; must you now, vermin and
      swarmers (I regret to make use of these strong expressions, my dear sir,
      but there are times when honest indignation will not be controlled), must
      you now, vermin and swarmers (for I <i>will </i>repeat it), take advantage of his
      unprotected state, assemble round him from all quarters, as wolves and
      vultures, and other animals of the feathered tribe assemble round&mdash;I
      will not say round carrion or a carcass, for Mr Chuzzlewit is quite the
      contrary&mdash;but round their prey; their prey; to rifle and despoil;
      gorging their voracious maws, and staining their offensive beaks, with
      every description of carnivorous enjoyment!&rsquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      As he stopped to fetch his breath, he waved them off, in a solemn manner,
      with his hand.
    </p>

    <p>
      &lsquo;Horde of unnatural plunderers and robbers!&rsquo; he continued; &lsquo;leave him!
      leave him, I say! Begone! Abscond! You had better be off! Wander over the
      face of the earth, young sirs, like vagabonds as you are, and do not
      presume to remain in a spot which is hallowed by the grey hairs of the
      patriarchal gentleman to whose tottering limbs I have the honour to act as
      an unworthy, but I hope an unassuming, prop and staff. And you, my tender
      sir,&rsquo; said Mr Pecksniff, addressing himself in a tone of gentle
      remonstrance to the old man, &lsquo;how could you ever leave me, though even for
      this short period! You have absented yourself, I do not doubt, upon some
      act of kindness to me; bless you for it; but you must not do it; you must
      not be so venturesome. I should really be angry with you if I could, my
      friend!&rsquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      He advanced with outstretched arms to take the old man&rsquo;s hand. But he had
      not seen how the hand clasped and clutched the stick within its grasp. As
      he came smiling on, and got within his reach, old Martin, with his burning
      indignation crowded into one vehement burst, and flashing out of every
      line and wrinkle in his face, rose up, and struck him down upon the
      ground.
    </p>
    <p>
      With such a well-directed nervous blow, that down he went, as heavily and
      true as if the charge of a Life-Guardsman had tumbled him out of a saddle.
      And whether he was stunned by the shock, or only confused by the wonder
      and novelty of this warm reception, he did not offer to get up again; but
      lay there, looking about him with a disconcerted meekness in his face so
      enormously ridiculous, that neither Mark Tapley nor John Westlock could
      repress a smile, though both were actively interposing to prevent a
      repetition of the blow; which the old man&rsquo;s gleaming eyes and vigorous
      attitude seemed to render one of the most probable events in the world.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Drag him away! Take him out of my reach!&rsquo; said Martin; &lsquo;or I can&rsquo;t help
      it. The strong restraint I have put upon my hands has been enough to palsy
      them. I am not master of myself while he is within their range. Drag him
      away!&rsquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      Seeing that he still did not rise, Mr Tapley, without any compromise about
      it, actually did drag him away, and stick him up on the floor, with his
      back against the opposite wall.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Hear me, rascal!&rsquo; said Mr Chuzzlewit. &lsquo;I have summoned you here to
      witness your own work. I have summoned you here to witness it, because I
      know it will be gall and wormwood to you! I have summoned you here to
      witness it, because I know the sight of everybody here must be a dagger in
      your mean, false heart! What! do you know me as I am, at last!&rsquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      Mr Pecksniff had cause to stare at him, for the triumph in his face and
      speech and figure was a sight to stare at.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Look there!&rsquo; said the old man, pointing at him, and appealing to the
      rest. &lsquo;Look there! And then&mdash;come hither, my dear Martin&mdash;look
      here! here! here!&rsquo; At every repetition of the word he pressed his grandson
      closer to his breast.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;The passion I felt, Martin, when I dared not do this,&rsquo; he said, &lsquo;was in
      the blow I struck just now. Why did we ever part! How could we ever part!
      How could you ever fly from me to him!&rsquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      Martin was about to answer, but he stopped him, and went on.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;The fault was mine no less than yours. Mark has told me so today, and I
      have known it long; though not so long as I might have done. Mary, my
      love, come here.&rsquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      As she trembled and was very pale, he sat her in his own chair, and stood
      beside it with her hand in his; and Martin standing by him.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;The curse of our house,&rsquo; said the old man, looking kindly down upon her,
      &lsquo;has been the love of self; has ever been the love of self. How often have
      I said so, when I never knew that I had wrought it upon others.&rsquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      He drew one hand through Martin&rsquo;s arm, and standing so, between them,
      proceeded thus:
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;You all know how I bred this orphan up, to tend me. None of you can know
      by what degrees I have come to regard her as a daughter; for she has won
      upon me, by her self-forgetfulness, her tenderness, her patience, all the
      goodness of her nature, when Heaven is her witness that I took but little
      pains to draw it forth. It blossomed without cultivation, and it ripened
      without heat. I cannot find it in my heart to say that I am sorry for it
      now, or yonder fellow might be holding up his head.&rsquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      Mr Pecksniff put his hand into his waistcoat, and slightly shook that part
      of him to which allusion had been made; as if to signify that it was still
      uppermost.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;There is a kind of selfishness,&rsquo; said Martin&mdash;&lsquo;I have learned it in
      my own experience of my own breast&mdash;which is constantly upon the
      watch for selfishness in others; and holding others at a distance, by
      suspicions and distrusts, wonders why they don&rsquo;t approach, and don&rsquo;t
      confide, and calls that selfishness in them. Thus I once doubted those
      about me&mdash;not without reason in the beginning&mdash;and thus I once
      doubted you, Martin.&rsquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Not without reason,&rsquo; Martin answered, &lsquo;either.&rsquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Listen, hypocrite! Listen, smooth-tongued, servile, crawling knave!&rsquo; said
      Martin. &lsquo;Listen, you shallow dog. What! When I was seeking him, you had
      already spread your nets; you were already fishing for him, were ye? When
      I lay ill in this good woman&rsquo;s house and your meek spirit pleaded for my
      grandson, you had already caught him, had ye? Counting on the restoration
      of the love you knew I bore him, you designed him for one of your two
      daughters did ye? Or failing that, you traded in him as a speculation
      which at any rate should blind me with the lustre of your charity, and
      found a claim upon me! Why, even then I knew you, and I told you so. Did I
      tell you that I knew you, even then?&rsquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;I am not angry, sir,&rsquo; said Mr Pecksniff, softly. &lsquo;I can bear a great deal
      from you. I will never contradict you, Mr Chuzzlewit.&rsquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Observe!&rsquo; said Martin, looking round. &lsquo;I put myself in that man&rsquo;s hands
      on terms as mean and base, and as degrading to himself, as I could render
      them in words. I stated them at length to him, before his own children,
      syllable by syllable, as coarsely as I could, and with as much offence,
      and with as plain an exposition of my contempt, as words&mdash;not looks
      and manner merely&mdash;could convey. If I had only called the angry blood
      into his face, I would have wavered in my purpose. If I had only stung him
      into being a man for a minute I would have abandoned it. If he had offered
      me one word of remonstrance, in favour of the grandson whom he supposed I
      had disinherited; if he had pleaded with me, though never so faintly,
      against my appeal to him to abandon him to misery and cast him from his
      house; I think I could have borne with him for ever afterwards. But not a
      word, not a word. Pandering to the worst of human passions was the office
      of his nature; and faithfully he did his work!&rsquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;I am not angry,&rsquo; observed Mr Pecksniff. &lsquo;I am hurt, Mr Chuzzlewit;
      wounded in my feelings; but I am not angry, my good sir.&rsquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      Mr Chuzzlewit resumed.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Once resolved to try him, I was resolute to pursue the trial to the end;
      but while I was bent on fathoming the depth of his duplicity, I made a
      sacred compact with myself that I would give him credit on the other side
      for any latent spark of goodness, honour, forbearance&mdash;any virtue&mdash;that
      might glimmer in him. For first to last there has been no such thing. Not
      once. He cannot say I have not given him opportunity. He cannot say I have
      ever led him on. He cannot say I have not left him freely to himself in
      all things; or that I have not been a passive instrument in his hands,
      which he might have used for good as easily as evil. Or if he can, he
      Lies! And that&rsquo;s his nature, too.&rsquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Mr Chuzzlewit,&rsquo; interrupted Pecksniff, shedding tears. &lsquo;I am not angry,
      sir. I cannot be angry with you. But did you never, my dear sir, express a
      desire that the unnatural young man who by his wicked arts has estranged
      your good opinion from me, for the time being; only for the time being;
      that your grandson, Mr Chuzzlewit, should be dismissed my house? Recollect
      yourself, my Christian friend.&rsquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;I have said so, have I not?&rsquo; retorted the old man, sternly. &lsquo;I could not
      tell how far your specious hypocrisy had deceived him, knave; and knew no
      better way of opening his eyes than by presenting you before him in your
      own servile character. Yes. I did express that desire. And you leaped to
      meet it; and you met it; and turning in an instant on the hand you had
      licked and beslavered, as only such hounds can, you strengthened, and
      confirmed, and justified me in my scheme.&rsquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      Mr Pecksniff made a bow; a submissive, not to say a grovelling and an
      abject bow. If he had been complimented on his practice of the loftiest
      virtues, he never could have bowed as he bowed then.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;The wretched man who has been murdered,&rsquo; Mr Chuzzlewit went on to say;
      &lsquo;then passing by the name of&mdash;&rsquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Tigg,&rsquo; suggested Mark.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Of Tigg; brought begging messages to me on behalf of a friend of his, and
      an unworthy relative of mine; and finding him a man well enough suited to
      my purpose, I employed him to glean some news of you, Martin, for me. It
      was from him I learned that you had taken up your abode with yonder
      fellow. It was he, who meeting you here in town, one evening&mdash;you
      remember where?&rsquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;At the pawnbroker&rsquo;s shop,&rsquo; said Martin.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Yes; watched you to your lodging, and enabled me to send you a
      bank-note.&rsquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;I little thought,&rsquo; said Martin, greatly moved, &lsquo;that it had come from
      you; I little thought that you were interested in my fate. If I had&mdash;&rsquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;If you had,&rsquo; returned the old man, sorrowfully, &lsquo;you would have shown
      less knowledge of me as I seemed to be, and as I really was. I hoped to
      bring you back, Martin, penitent and humbled. I hoped to distress you into
      coming back to me. Much as I loved you, I had that to acknowledge which I
      could not reconcile it to myself to avow, then, unless you made submission
      to me first. Thus it was I lost you. If I have had, indirectly, any act or
      part in the fate of that unhappy man, by putting means, however small,
      within his reach, Heaven forgive me! I might have known, perhaps, that he
      would misuse money; that it was ill-bestowed upon him; and that sown by
      his hands it could engender mischief only. But I never thought of him at
      that time as having the disposition or ability to be a serious impostor,
      or otherwise than as a thoughtless, idle-humoured, dissipated spendthrift,
      sinning more against himself than others, and frequenting low haunts and
      indulging vicious tastes, to his own ruin only.&rsquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Beggin&rsquo; your pardon, sir,&rsquo; said Mr Tapley, who had Mrs Lupin on his arm
      by this time, quite agreeably; &lsquo;if I may make so bold as say so, my
      opinion is, as you was quite correct, and that he turned out perfectly
      nat&rsquo;ral for all that. There&rsquo;s surprisin&rsquo; number of men sir, who as long as
      they&rsquo;ve only got their own shoes and stockings to depend upon, will walk
      down hill, along the gutters quiet enough and by themselves, and not do
      much harm. But set any on &lsquo;em up with a coach and horses, sir; and it&rsquo;s
      wonderful what a knowledge of drivin&rsquo; he&rsquo;ll show, and how he&rsquo;ll fill his
      wehicle with passengers, and start off in the middle of the road, neck or
      nothing, to the Devil! Bless your heart, sir, there&rsquo;s ever so many Tiggs
      a-passin&rsquo; this here Temple-gate any hour in the day, that only want a
      chance to turn out full-blown Montagues every one!&rsquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Your ignorance, as you call it, Mark,&rsquo; said Mr Chuzzlewit, &lsquo;is wiser than
      some men&rsquo;s enlightenment, and mine among them. You are right; not for the
      first time to-day. Now hear me out, my dears. And hear me, you, who, if
      what I have been told be accurately stated, are Bankrupt in pocket no less
      than in good name! And when you have heard me, leave this place, and
      poison my sight no more!&rsquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      Mr Pecksniff laid his hand upon his breast, and bowed again.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;The penance I have done in this house,&rsquo; said Mr Chuzzlewit, &lsquo;has earned
      this reflection with it constantly, above all others. That if it had
      pleased Heaven to visit such infirmity on my old age as really had reduced
      me to the state in which I feigned to be, I should have brought its misery
      upon myself. Oh, you whose wealth, like mine, has been a source of
      continual unhappiness, leading you to distrust the nearest and dearest,
      and to dig yourself a living grave of suspicion and reserve; take heed
      that, having cast off all whom you might have bound to you, and tenderly,
      you do not become in your decay the instrument of such a man as this, and
      waken in another world to the knowledge of such wrong as would embitter
      Heaven itself, if wrong or you could ever reach it!&rsquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      And then he told them how he had sometimes thought, in the beginning, that
      love might grow up between Mary and Martin; and how he had pleased his
      fancy with the picture of observing it when it was new, and taking them to
      task, apart, in counterfeited doubt, and then confessing to them that it
      had been an object dear to his heart; and by his sympathy with them, and
      generous provision for their young fortunes, establishing a claim on their
      affection and regard which nothing should wither, and which should
      surround his old age with means of happiness. How in the first dawn of
      this design, and when the pleasure of such a scheme for the happiness of
      others was new and indistinct within him, Martin had come to tell him that
      he had already chosen for himself; knowing that he, the old man, had some
      faint project on that head, but ignorant whom it concerned. How it was
      little comfort to him to know that Martin had chosen Her, because the
      grace of his design was lost, and because finding that she had returned
      his love, he tortured himself with the reflection that they, so young, to
      whom he had been so kind a benefactor, were already like the world, and
      bent on their own selfish, stealthy ends. How in the bitterness of this
      impression, and of his past experience, he had reproached Martin so
      harshly (forgetting that he had never invited his confidence on such a
      point, and confounding what he had meant to do with what he had done),
      that high words sprung up between them, and they separated in wrath. How
      he loved him still, and hoped he would return. How on the night of his
      illness at the Dragon, he had secretly written tenderly of him, and made
      him his heir, and sanctioned his marriage with Mary; and how, after his
      interview with Mr Pecksniff, he had distrusted him again, and burnt the
      paper to ashes, and had lain down in his bed distracted by suspicions,
      doubts, and regrets.
    </p>
    <p>
      And then he told them how, resolved to probe this Pecksniff, and to prove
      the constancy and truth of Mary (to himself no less than Martin), he had
      conceived and entered on his plan; and how, beneath her gentleness and
      patience, he had softened more and more; still more and more beneath the
      goodness and simplicity, the honour and the manly faith of Tom. And when
      he spoke of Tom, he said God bless him; and the tears were in his eyes;
      for he said that Tom, mistrusted and disliked by him at first, had come
      like summer rain upon his heart; and had disposed it to believe in better
      things. And Martin took him by the hand, and Mary too, and John, his old
      friend, stoutly too; and Mark, and Mrs Lupin, and his sister, little Ruth.
      And peace of mind, deep, tranquil peace of mind, was in Tom&rsquo;s heart.
    </p>
    <p>
      The old man then related how nobly Mr Pecksniff had performed the duty in
      which he stood indebted to society, in the matter of Tom&rsquo;s dismissal; and
      how, having often heard disparagement of Mr Westlock from Pecksniffian
      lips, and knowing him to be a friend to Tom, he had used, through his
      confidential agent and solicitor, that little artifice which had kept him
      in readiness to receive his unknown friend in London. And he called on Mr
      Pecksniff (by the name of Scoundrel) to remember that there again he had
      not trapped him to do evil, but that he had done it of his own free will
      and agency; nay, that he had cautioned him against it. And once again he
      called on Mr Pecksniff (by the name of Hang-dog) to remember that when
      Martin coming home at last, an altered man, had sued for the forgiveness
      which awaited him, he, Pecksniff, had rejected him in language of his own,
      and had remorsely stepped in between him and the least touch of natural
      tenderness. &lsquo;For which,&rsquo; said the old man, &lsquo;if the bending of my finger
      would remove a halter from your neck, I wouldn&rsquo;t bend it!&rsquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Martin,&rsquo; he added, &lsquo;your rival has not been a dangerous one, but Mrs
      Lupin here has played duenna for some weeks; not so much to watch your
      love as to watch her lover. For that Ghoul&rsquo;&mdash;his fertility in finding
      names for Mr Pecksniff was astonishing&mdash;&lsquo;would have crawled into her
      daily walks otherwise, and polluted the fresh air. What&rsquo;s this? Her hand
      is trembling strangely. See if you can hold it.&rsquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      Hold it! If he clasped it half as tightly as he did her waist. Well, well!
    </p>
    <p>
      But it was good in him that even then, in his high fortune and happiness,
      with her lips nearly printed on his own, and her proud young beauty in his
      close embrace, he had a hand still left to stretch out to Tom Pinch.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Oh, Tom! Dear Tom! I saw you, accidentally, coming here. Forgive me!&rsquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Forgive!&rsquo; cried Tom. &lsquo;I&rsquo;ll never forgive you as long as I live, Martin,
      if you say another syllable about it. Joy to you both! Joy, my dear
      fellow, fifty thousand times.&rsquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      Joy! There is not a blessing on earth that Tom did not wish them. There is
      not a blessing on earth that Tom would not have bestowed upon them, if he
      could.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;I beg your pardon, sir,&rsquo; said Mr Tapley, stepping forward, &lsquo;but yow was
      mentionin&rsquo;, just now, a lady of the name of Lupin, sir.&rsquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;I was,&rsquo; returned old Martin
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Yes, sir. It&rsquo;s a pretty name, sir?&rsquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;A very good name,&rsquo; said Martin.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;It seems a&rsquo;most a pity to change such a name into Tapley. Don&rsquo;t it, sir?&rsquo;
      said Mark.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;That depends upon the lady. What is <i>her </i>opinion?&rsquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Why, sir,&rsquo; said Mr Tapley, retiring, with a bow, towards the buxom
      hostess, &lsquo;her opinion is as the name ain&rsquo;t a change for the better, but
      the indiwidual may be, and, therefore, if nobody ain&rsquo;t acquainted with no
      jest cause or impediment, et cetrer, the Blue Dragon will be con-werted
      into the Jolly Tapley. A sign of my own inwention, sir. Wery new,
      conwivial, and expressive!&rsquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      The whole of these proceedings were so agreeable to Mr Pecksniff that he
      stood with his eyes fixed upon the floor and his hands clasping one
      another alternately, as if a host of penal sentences were being passed
      upon him. Not only did his figure appear to have shrunk, but his
      discomfiture seemed to have extended itself even to his dress. His clothes
      seemed to have grown shabbier, his linen to have turned yellow, his hair
      to have become lank and frowsy; his very boots looked villanous and dim,
      as if their gloss had departed with his own.
    </p>
    <p>
      Feeling, rather than seeing, that the old man now pointed to the door, he
      raised his eyes, picked up his hat, and thus addressed him:
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Mr Chuzzlewit, sir! you have partaken of my hospitality.&rsquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;And paid for it,&rsquo; he observed.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Thank you. That savours,&rsquo; said Mr Pecksniff, taking out his
      pocket-handkerchief, &lsquo;of your old familiar frankness. You have paid for
      it. I was about to make the remark. You have deceived me, sir. Thank you
      again. I am glad of it. To see you in the possession of your health and
      faculties on any terms, is, in itself, a sufficient recompense. To have
      been deceived implies a trusting nature. Mine is a trusting nature. I am
      thankful for it. I would rather have a trusting nature, do you know, sir,
      than a doubting one!&rsquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      Here Mr Pecksniff, with a sad smile, bowed, and wiped his eyes.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;There is hardly any person present, Mr Chuzzlewit,&rsquo; said Pecksniff, &lsquo;by
      whom I have not been deceived. I have forgiven those persons on the spot.
      That was my duty; and, of course, I have done it. Whether it was worthy of
      you to partake of my hospitality, and to act the part you did act in my
      house, that, sir, is a question which I leave to your own conscience. And
      your conscience does not acquit you. No, sir, no!&rsquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      Pronouncing these last words in a loud and solemn voice, Mr Pecksniff was
      not so absolutely lost in his own fervour as to be unmindful of the
      expediency of getting a little nearer to the door.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;I have been struck this day,&rsquo; said Mr Pecksniff, &lsquo;with a walking stick
      (which I have every reason to believe has knobs upon it), on that delicate
      and exquisite portion of the human anatomy&mdash;the brain. Several blows
      have been inflicted, sir, without a walking-stick, upon that tenderer
      portion of my frame&mdash;my heart. You have mentioned, sir, my being
      bankrupt in my purse. Yes, sir, I am. By an unfortunate speculation,
      combined with treachery, I find myself reduced to poverty; at a time, sir,
      when the child of my bosom is widowed, and affliction and disgrace are in
      my family.&rsquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      Here Mr Pecksniff wiped his eyes again, and gave himself two or three
      little knocks upon the breast, as if he were answering two or three other
      little knocks from within, given by the tinkling hammer of his conscience,
      to express &lsquo;Cheer up, my boy!&rsquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;I know the human mind, although I trust it. That is my weakness. Do I not
      know, sir&rsquo;&mdash;here he became exceedingly plaintive and was observed to
      glance towards Tom Pinch&mdash;&lsquo;that my misfortunes bring this treatment
      on me? Do I not know, sir, that but for them I never should have heard
      what I have heard to-day? Do I not know that in the silence and the
      solitude of night, a little voice will whisper in your ear, Mr Chuzzlewit,
      &ldquo;This was not well. This was not well, sir!&rdquo; Think of this, sir (if you
      will have the goodness), remote from the impulses of passion, and apart
      from the specialities, if I may use that strong remark, of prejudice. And
      if you ever contemplate the silent tomb, sir, which you will excuse me for
      entertaining some doubt of your doing, after the conduct into which you
      have allowed yourself to be betrayed this day; if you ever contemplate the
      silent tomb sir, think of me. If you find yourself approaching to the
      silent tomb, sir, think of me. If you should wish to have anything
      inscribed upon your silent tomb, sir, let it be, that I&mdash;ah, my
      remorseful sir! that I&mdash;the humble individual who has now the honour
      of reproaching you, forgave you. That I forgave you when my injuries were
      fresh, and when my bosom was newly wrung. It may be bitterness to you to
      hear it now, sir, but you will live to seek a consolation in it. May you
      find a consolation in it when you want it, sir! Good morning!&rsquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      With this sublime address, Mr Pecksniff departed. But the effect of his
      departure was much impaired by his being immediately afterwards run
      against, and nearly knocked down, by a monstrously excited little man in
      velveteen shorts and a very tall hat; who came bursting up the stairs, and
      straight into the chambers of Mr Chuzzlewit, as if he were deranged.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Is there anybody here that knows him?&rsquo; cried the little man. &lsquo;Is there
      anybody here that knows him? Oh, my stars, is there anybody here that
      knows him?&rsquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      They looked at each other for an explanation; but nobody knew anything
      more than that here was an excited little man with a very tall hat on,
      running in and out of the room as hard as he could go; making his single
      pair of bright blue stockings appear at least a dozen; and constantly
      repeating in a shrill voice, &lsquo;<i>is</i> there anybody here that knows him?&rsquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;If your brains is not turned topjy turjey, Mr Sweedlepipes!&rsquo; exclaimed
      another voice, &lsquo;hold that there nige of yourn, I beg you, sir.&rsquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      At the same time Mrs Gamp was seen in the doorway; out of breath from
      coming up so many stairs, and panting fearfully; but dropping curtseys to
      the last.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Excuge the weakness of the man,&rsquo; said Mrs Gamp, eyeing Mr Sweedlepipe
      with great indignation; &lsquo;and well I might expect it, as I should have
      know&rsquo;d, and wishin&rsquo; he was drownded in the Thames afore I had brought him
      here, which not a blessed hour ago he nearly shaved the noge off from the
      father of as lovely a family as ever, Mr Chuzzlewit, was born three sets
      of twins, and would have done it, only he see it a-goin&rsquo; in the glass, and
      dodged the rager. And never, Mr Sweedlepipes, I do assure you, sir, did I
      so well know what a misfortun it was to be acquainted with you, as now I
      do, which so I say, sir, and I don&rsquo;t deceive you!&rsquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;I ask your pardon, ladies and gentlemen all,&rsquo; cried the little barber,
      taking off his hat, &lsquo;and yours too, Mrs Gamp. But&mdash;but,&rsquo; he added
      this half laughing and half crying, &lsquo;<i>is</i> there anybody here that knows
      him?&rsquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      As the barber said these words, a something in top-boots, with its head
      bandaged up, staggered into the room, and began going round and round and
      round, apparently under the impression that it was walking straight
      forward.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Look at him!&rsquo; cried the excited little barber. &lsquo;Here he is! That&rsquo;ll soon
      wear off, and then he&rsquo;ll be all right again. He&rsquo;s no more dead than I am.
      He&rsquo;s all alive and hearty. Aint you, Bailey?&rsquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;R&mdash;r&mdash;reether so, Poll!&rsquo; replied that gentleman.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Look here!&rsquo; cried the little barber, laughing and crying in the same
      breath. &lsquo;When I steady him he comes all right. There! He&rsquo;s all right now.
      Nothing&rsquo;s the matter with him now, except that he&rsquo;s a little shook and
      rather giddy; is there, Bailey?&rsquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;R&mdash;r&mdash;reether shook, Poll&mdash;reether so!&rsquo; said Mr Bailey.
      &lsquo;What, my lovely Sairey! There you air!&rsquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;What a boy he is!&rsquo; cried the tender-hearted Poll, actually sobbing over
      him. &lsquo;I never see sech a boy! It&rsquo;s all his fun. He&rsquo;s full of it. He shall
      go into the business along with me. I am determined he shall. We&rsquo;ll make
      it Sweedlepipe and Bailey. He shall have the sporting branch (what a one
      he&rsquo;ll be for the matches!) and me the shavin&rsquo;. I&rsquo;ll make over the birds to
      him as soon as ever he&rsquo;s well enough. He shall have the little bullfinch
      in the shop, and all. He&rsquo;s sech a boy! I ask your pardon, ladies and
      gentlemen, but I thought there might be some one here that know&rsquo;d him!&rsquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      Mrs Gamp had observed, not without jealousy and scorn, that a favourable
      impression appeared to exist in behalf of Mr Sweedlepipe and his young
      friend; and that she had fallen rather into the background in consequence.
      She now struggled to the front, therefore, and stated her business.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Which, Mr Chuzzlewit,&rsquo; she said, &lsquo;is well beknown to Mrs Harris as has
      one sweet infant (though she <i>do</i> not wish it known) in her own family by
      the mother&rsquo;s side, kep in spirits in a bottle; and that sweet babe she see
      at Greenwich Fair, a-travelling in company with a pink-eyed lady, Prooshan
      dwarf, and livin&rsquo; skelinton, which judge her feelings when the barrel
      organ played, and she was showed her own dear sister&rsquo;s child, the same not
      bein&rsquo; expected from the outside picter, where it was painted quite
      contrairy in a livin&rsquo; state, a many sizes larger, and performing beautiful
      upon the Arp, which never did that dear child know or do; since breathe it
      never did, to speak on in this wale! And Mrs Harris, Mr Chuzzlewit, has
      knowed me many year, and can give you information that the lady which is
      widdered can&rsquo;t do better and may do worse, than let me wait upon her,
      which I hope to do. Permittin&rsquo; the sweet faces as I see afore me.&rsquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Oh!&rsquo; said Mr Chuzzlewit. &lsquo;Is that your business? Was this good person
      paid for the trouble we gave her?&rsquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;I paid her, sir,&rsquo; returned Mark Tapley; &lsquo;liberal.&rsquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;The young man&rsquo;s words is true,&rsquo; said Mrs Gamp, &lsquo;and thank you kindly.&rsquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Then here we will close our acquaintance, Mrs Gamp,&rsquo; retorted Mr
      Chuzzlewit. &lsquo;And Mr Sweedlepipe&mdash;is that your name?&rsquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;That is my name, sir,&rsquo; replied Poll, accepting with a profusion of
      gratitude, some chinking pieces which the old man slipped into his hand.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Mr Sweedlepipe, take as much care of your lady-lodger as you can, and
      give her a word or two of good advice now and then. Such,&rsquo; said old
      Martin, looking gravely at the astonished Mrs Gamp, &lsquo;as hinting at the
      expediency of a little less liquor, and a little more humanity, and a
      little less regard for herself, and a little more regard for her patients,
      and perhaps a trifle of additional honesty. Or when Mrs Gamp gets into
      trouble, Mr Sweedlepipe, it had better not be at a time when I am near
      enough to the Old Bailey to volunteer myself as a witness to her
      character. Endeavour to impress that upon her at your leisure, if you
      please.&rsquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      Mrs Gamp clasped her hands, turned up her eyes until they were quite
      invisible, threw back her bonnet for the admission of fresh air to her
      heated brow; and in the act of saying faintly&mdash;&lsquo;Less liquor!&mdash;Sairey
      Gamp&mdash;Bottle on the chimney-piece, and let me put my lips to it, when
      I am so dispoged!&rsquo;&mdash;fell into one of the walking swoons; in which
      pitiable state she was conducted forth by Mr Sweedlepipe, who, between his
      two patients, the swooning Mrs Gamp and the revolving Bailey, had enough
      to do, poor fellow.
    </p>
    <p>
      The old man looked about him, with a smile, until his eyes rested on Tom
      Pinch&rsquo;s sister; when he smiled the more.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;We will all dine here together,&rsquo; he said; &lsquo;and as you and Mary have
      enough to talk of, Martin, you shall keep house for us until the
      afternoon, with Mr and Mrs Tapley. I must see your lodgings in the
      meanwhile, Tom.&rsquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      Tom was quite delighted. So was Ruth. She would go with them.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Thank you, my love,&rsquo; said Mr Chuzzlewit. &lsquo;But I am afraid I must take Tom
      a little out of the way, on business. Suppose you go on first, my dear?&rsquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      Pretty little Ruth was equally delighted to do that.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;But not alone,&rsquo; said Martin, &lsquo;not alone. Mr Westlock, I dare say, will
      escort you.&rsquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      Why, of course he would: what else had Mr Westlock in his mind? How dull
      these old men are!
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;You are sure you have no engagement?&rsquo; he persisted.
    </p>
    <p>
      Engagement! As if he could have any engagement!
    </p>
    <p>
      So they went off arm-in-arm. When Tom and Mr Chuzzlewit went off
      arm-in-arm a few minutes after them, the latter was still smiling; and
      really, for a gentleman of his habits, in rather a knowing manner.

      CHAPTER FIFTY-THREE
    </h2>
    <p>
      WHAT JOHN WESTLOCK SAID TO TOM PINCH&rsquo;S SISTER; WHAT TOM PINCH&rsquo;S SISTER
      SAID TO JOHN WESTLOCK; WHAT TOM PINCH SAID TO BOTH OF THEM; AND HOW THEY
      ALL PASSED THE REMAINDER OF THE DAY
    </p>
    <p>
      Brilliantly the Temple Fountain sparkled in the sun, and laughingly its
      liquid music played, and merrily the idle drops of water danced and
      danced, and peeping out in sport among the trees, plunged lightly down to
      hide themselves, as little Ruth and her companion came toward it.
    </p>
    <p>
      And why they came toward the Fountain at all is a mystery; for they had no
      business there. It was not in their way. It was quite out of their way.
      They had no more to do with the Fountain, bless you, than they had with&mdash;with
      Love, or any out-of-the-way thing of that sort.
    </p>
    <p>
      It was all very well for Tom and his sister to make appointments by the
      Fountain, but that was quite another affair. Because, of course, when she
      had to wait a minute or two, it would have been very awkward for her to
      have had to wait in any but a tolerably quiet spot; but that was as quiet
      a spot, everything considered, as they could choose. But when she had John
      Westlock to take care of her, and was going home with her arm in his (home
      being in a different direction altogether), their coming anywhere near
      that Fountain was quite extraordinary.
    </p>
    <p>
      However, there they found themselves. And another extraordinary part of
      the matter was, that they seemed to have come there, by a silent
      understanding. Yet when they got there, they were a little confused by
      being there, which was the strangest part of all; because there is nothing
      naturally confusing in a Fountain. We all know that.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;What a good old place it was!&rsquo; John said. With quite an earnest affection
      for it.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;A pleasant place indeed,&rsquo; said little Ruth. &lsquo;So shady!&rsquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      Oh wicked little Ruth!
    </p>
    <p>
      They came to a stop when John began to praise it. The day was exquisite;
      and stopping at all, it was quite natural&mdash;nothing could be more so&mdash;that
      they should glance down Garden Court; because Garden Court ends in the
      Garden, and the Garden ends in the River, and that glimpse is very bright
      and fresh and shining on a summer&rsquo;s day. Then, oh, little Ruth, why not
      look boldly at it! Why fit that tiny, precious, blessed little foot into
      the cracked corner of an insensible old flagstone in the pavement; and be
      so very anxious to adjust it to a nicety!
    </p>
    <p>
      If the Fiery-faced matron in the crunched bonnet could have seen them as
      they walked away, how many years&rsquo; purchase might Fiery Face have been
      disposed to take for her situation in Furnival&rsquo;s Inn as laundress to Mr
      Westlock!
    </p>
    <p>
      They went away, but not through London&rsquo;s streets! Through some enchanted
      city, where the pavements were of air; where all the rough sounds of a
      stirring town were softened into gentle music; where everything was happy;
      where there was no distance, and no time. There were two good-tempered
      burly draymen letting down big butts of beer into a cellar, somewhere; and
      when John helped her&mdash;almost lifted her&mdash;the lightest, easiest,
      neatest thing you ever saw&mdash;across the rope, they said he owed them a
      good turn for giving him the chance. Celestial draymen!
    </p>
    <p>
      Green pastures in the summer tide, deep-littered straw yards in the
      winter, no start of corn and clover, ever, to that noble horse who <i>would</i>
      dance on the pavement with a gig behind him, and who frightened her, and
      made her clasp his arm with both hands (both hands meeting one upon the
      another so endearingly!), and caused her to implore him to take refuge in
      the pastry-cook&rsquo;s, and afterwards to peep out at the door so shrinkingly;
      and then, looking at him with those eyes, to ask him was he sure&mdash;now
      was he sure&mdash;they might go safely on! Oh for a string of rampant
      horses! For a lion, for a bear, for a mad bull, for anything to bring the
      little hands together on his arm again!
    </p>
    <p>
      They talked, of course. They talked of Tom, and all these changes and the
      attachment Mr Chuzzlewit had conceived for him, and the bright prospects
      he had in such a friend, and a great deal more to the same purpose. The
      more they talked, the more afraid this fluttering little Ruth became of
      any pause; and sooner than have a pause she would say the same things over
      again; and if she hadn&rsquo;t courage or presence of mind enough for that (to
      say the truth she very seldom had), she was ten thousand times more
      charming and irresistible than she had been before.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Martin will be married very soon now, I suppose?&rsquo; said John.
    </p>
    <p>
      She supposed he would. Never did a bewitching little woman suppose
      anything in such a faint voice as Ruth supposed that.
    </p>
    <p>
      But seeing that another of those alarming pauses was approaching, she
      remarked that he would have a beautiful wife. Didn&rsquo;t Mr Westlock think so?
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Ye&mdash;yes,&rsquo; said John, &lsquo;oh, yes.&rsquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      She feared he was rather hard to please, he spoke so coldly.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Rather say already pleased,&rsquo; said John. &lsquo;I have scarcely seen her. I had
      no care to see her. I had no eyes for <i>her</i>, this morning.&rsquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      Oh, good gracious!
    </p>
    <p>
      It was well they had reached their destination. She never could have gone
      any further. It would have been impossible to walk in such a tremble.
    </p>
    <p>
      Tom had not come in. They entered the triangular parlour together, and
      alone. Fiery Face, Fiery Face, how many years&rsquo; purchase <i>now</i>!
    </p>
    <p>
      She sat down on the little sofa, and untied her bonnet-strings. He sat
      down by her side, and very near her; very, very near her. Oh rapid,
      swelling, bursting little heart, you knew that it would come to this, and
      hoped it would. Why beat so wildly, heart!
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Dear Ruth! Sweet Ruth! If I had loved you less, I could have told you
      that I loved you, long ago. I have loved you from the first. There never
      was a creature in the world more truly loved than you, dear Ruth, by me!&rsquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      She clasped her little hands before her face. The gushing tears of joy,
      and pride, and hope, and innocent affection, would not be restrained.
      Fresh from her full young heart they came to answer him.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;My dear love! If this is&mdash;I almost dare to hope it is, now&mdash;not
      painful or distressing to you, you make me happier than I can tell, or you
      imagine. Darling Ruth! My own good, gentle, winning Ruth! I hope I know
      the value of your heart, I hope I know the worth of your angel nature. Let
      me try and show you that I do; and you will make me happier, Ruth&mdash;&rsquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Not happier,&rsquo; she sobbed, &lsquo;than you make me. No one can be happier, John,
      than you make me!&rsquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      Fiery Face, provide yourself! The usual wages or the usual warning. It&rsquo;s
      all over, Fiery Face. We needn&rsquo;t trouble you any further.
    </p>
    <p>
      The little hands could meet each other now, without a rampant horse to
      urge them. There was no occasion for lions, bears, or mad bulls. It could
      all be done, and infinitely better, without their assistance. No burly
      drayman or big butts of beer, were wanted for apologies. No apology at all
      was wanted. The soft light touch fell coyly, but quite naturally, upon the
      lover&rsquo;s shoulder; the delicate waist, the drooping head, the blushing
      cheek, the beautiful eyes, the exquisite mouth itself, were all as natural
      as possible. If all the horses in Araby had run away at once, they
      couldn&rsquo;t have improved upon it.
    </p>
    <p>
      They soon began to talk of Tom again.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;I hope he will be glad to hear of it!&rsquo; said John, with sparkling eyes.
    </p>
    <p>
      Ruth drew the little hands a little tighter when he said it, and looked up
      seriously into his face.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;I am never to leave him, <i>am</i> I, dear? I could never leave Tom. I am sure
      you know that.&rsquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Do you think I would ask you?&rsquo; he returned, with a&mdash;well! Never mind
      with what.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;I am sure you never would,&rsquo; she answered, the bright tears standing in
      her eyes.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;And I will swear it, Ruth, my darling, if you please. Leave Tom! That
      would be a strange beginning. Leave Tom, dear! If Tom and we be not
      inseparable, and Tom (God bless him) have not all honour and all love in
      our home, my little wife, may that home never be! And that&rsquo;s a strong
      oath, Ruth.&rsquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      Shall it be recorded how she thanked him? Yes, it shall. In all simplicity
      and innocence and purity of heart, yet with a timid, graceful,
      half-determined hesitation, she set a little rosy seal upon the vow, whose
      colour was reflected in her face, and flashed up to the braiding of her
      dark brown hair.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Tom will be so happy, and so proud, and glad,&rsquo; she said, clasping her
      little hands. &lsquo;But so surprised! I am sure he had never thought of such a
      thing.&rsquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      Of course John asked her immediately&mdash;because you know they were in
      that foolish state when great allowances must be made&mdash;when <i>she </i>had
      begun to think of such a thing, and this made a little diversion in their
      talk; a charming diversion to them, but not so interesting to us; at the
      end of which, they came back to Tom again.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Ah! dear Tom!&rsquo; said Ruth. &lsquo;I suppose I ought to tell you everything now.
      I should have no secrets from you. Should I, John, love?&rsquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      It is of no use saying how that preposterous John answered her, because he
      answered in a manner which is untranslatable on paper though highly
      satisfactory in itself. But what he conveyed was, No no no, sweet Ruth; or
      something to that effect.
    </p>
    <p>
      Then she told him Tom&rsquo;s great secret; not exactly saying how she had found
      it out, but leaving him to understand it if he liked; and John was sadly
      grieved to hear it, and was full of sympathy and sorrow. But they would
      try, he said, only the more, on this account to make him happy, and to
      beguile him with his favourite pursuits. And then, in all the confidence
      of such a time, he told her how he had a capital opportunity of
      establishing himself in his old profession in the country; and how he had
      been thinking, in the event of that happiness coming upon him which had
      actually come&mdash;there was another slight diversion here&mdash;how he
      had been thinking that it would afford occupation to Tom, and enable them
      to live together in the easiest manner, without any sense of dependence on
      Tom&rsquo;s part; and to be as happy as the day was long. And Ruth receiving
      this with joy, they went on catering for Tom to that extent that they had
      already purchased him a select library and built him an organ, on which he
      was performing with the greatest satisfaction, when they heard him
      knocking at the door.
    </p>
    <p>
      Though she longed to tell him what had happened, poor little Ruth was
      greatly agitated by his arrival; the more so because she knew that Mr
      Chuzzlewit was with him. So she said, all in a tremble:
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;What shall I do, dear John! I can&rsquo;t bear that he should hear it from any
      one but me, and I could not tell him, unless we were alone.&rsquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Do, my love,&rsquo; said John, &lsquo;whatever is natural to you on the impulse of
      the moment, and I am sure it will be right.&rsquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      He had hardly time to say thus much, and Ruth had hardly time to&mdash;just
      to get a little farther off&mdash;upon the sofa, when Tom and Mr
      Chuzzlewit came in. Mr Chuzzlewit came first, and Tom was a few seconds
      behind him.
    </p>
    <p>
      Now Ruth had hastily resolved that she would beckon Tom upstairs after a
      short time, and would tell him in his little bedroom. But when she saw his
      dear old face come in, her heart was so touched that she ran into his
      arms, and laid her head down on his breast and sobbed out, &lsquo;Bless me, Tom!
      My dearest brother!&rsquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      Tom looked up, in surprise, and saw John Westlock close beside him,
      holding out his hand.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;John!&rsquo; cried Tom. &lsquo;John!&rsquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Dear Tom,&rsquo; said his friend, &lsquo;give me your hand. We are brothers, Tom.&rsquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      Tom wrung it with all his force, embraced his sister fervently, and put
      her in John Westlock&rsquo;s arms.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Don&rsquo;t speak to me, John. Heaven is very good to us. I&mdash;&rsquo; Tom could
      find no further utterance, but left the room; and Ruth went after him.
    </p>
    <p>
      And when they came back, which they did by-and-bye, she looked more
      beautiful, and Tom more good and true (if that were possible) than ever.
      And though Tom could not speak upon the subject even now; being yet too
      newly glad, he put both his hands in both of John&rsquo;s with emphasis
      sufficient for the best speech ever spoken.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;I am glad you chose to-day,&rsquo; said Mr Chuzzlewit to John; with the same
      knowing smile as when they had left him. &lsquo;I thought you would. I hoped Tom
      and I lingered behind a discreet time. It&rsquo;s so long since I had any
      practical knowledge of these subjects, that I have been anxious, I assure
      you.&rsquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Your knowledge is still pretty accurate, sir,&rsquo; returned John, laughing,
      &lsquo;if it led you to foresee what would happen to-day.&rsquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Why, I am not sure, Mr Westlock,&rsquo; said the old man, &lsquo;that any great
      spirit of prophecy was needed, after seeing you and Ruth together. Come
      hither, pretty one. See what Tom and I purchased this morning, while you
      were dealing in exchange with that young merchant there.&rsquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      The old man&rsquo;s way of seating her beside him, and humouring his voice as if
      she were a child, was whimsical enough, but full of tenderness, and not
      ill adapted, somehow, to little Ruth.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;See here!&rsquo; he said, taking a case from his pocket, &lsquo;what a beautiful
      necklace. Ah! How it glitters! Earrings, too, and bracelets, and a zone
      for your waist. This set is yours, and Mary has another like it. Tom
      couldn&rsquo;t understand why I wanted two. What a short-sighted Tom! Earrings
      and bracelets, and a zone for your waist! Ah! Beautiful! Let us see how
      brave they look. Ask Mr Westlock to clasp them on.&rsquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      It was the prettiest thing to see her holding out her round, white arm;
      and John (oh deep, deep John!) pretending that the bracelet was very hard
      to fasten; it was the prettiest thing to see her girding on the precious
      little zone, and yet obliged to have assistance because her fingers were
      in such terrible perplexity; it was the prettiest thing to see her so
      confused and bashful, with the smiles and blushes playing brightly on her
      face, like the sparkling light upon the jewels; it was the prettiest thing
      that you would see, in the common experiences of a twelvemonth, rely upon
      it.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;The set of jewels and the wearer are so well matched,&rsquo; said the old man,
      &lsquo;that I don&rsquo;t know which becomes the other most. Mr Westlock could tell
      me, I have no doubt, but I&rsquo;ll not ask him, for he is bribed. Health to
      wear them, my dear, and happiness to make you forgetful of them, except as
      a remembrance from a loving friend!&rsquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      He patted her upon the cheek, and said to Tom:
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;I must play the part of a father here, Tom, also. There are not many
      fathers who marry two such daughters on the same day; but we will overlook
      the improbability for the gratification of an old man&rsquo;s fancy. I may claim
      that much indulgence,&rsquo; he added, &lsquo;for I have gratified few fancies enough
      in my life tending to the happiness of others, Heaven knows!&rsquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      These various proceedings had occupied so much time, and they fell into
      such a pleasant conversation now, that it was within a quarter of an hour
      of the time appointed for dinner before any of them thought about it. A
      hackney-coach soon carried them to the Temple, however; and there they
      found everything prepared for their reception.
    </p>
    <p>
      Mr Tapley having been furnished with unlimited credentials relative to the
      ordering of dinner, had so exerted himself for the honour of the party,
      that a prodigious banquet was served, under the joint direction of himself
      and his Intended. Mr Chuzzlewit would have had them of the party, and
      Martin urgently seconded his wish, but Mark could by no means be persuaded
      to sit down at table; observing, that in having the honour of attending to
      their comforts, he felt himself, indeed, the landlord of the Jolly Tapley,
      and could almost delude himself into the belief that the entertainment was
      actually being held under the Jolly Tapley&rsquo;s roof.
    </p>
    <p>
      For the better encouragement of himself in this fable, Mr Tapley took it
      upon him to issue divers general directions to the waiters from the hotel,
      relative to the disposal of the dishes and so forth; and as they were
      usually in direct opposition to all precedent, and were always issued in
      his most facetious form of thought and speech, they occasioned great
      merriment among those attendants; in which Mr Tapley participated, with an
      infinite enjoyment of his own humour. He likewise entertained them with
      short anecdotes of his travels appropriate to the occasion; and now and
      then with some comic passage or other between himself and Mrs Lupin; so
      that explosive laughs were constantly issuing from the side-board, and
      from the backs of chairs; and the head-waiter (who wore powder, and
      knee-smalls, and was usually a grave man) got to be a bright scarlet in
      the face, and broke his waistcoat-strings audibly.
    </p>
    <p>
      Young Martin sat at the head of the table, and Tom Pinch at the foot; and
      if there were a genial face at that board, it was Tom&rsquo;s. They all took
      their tone from Tom. Everybody drank to him, everybody looked to him,
      everybody thought of him, everybody loved him. If he so much as laid down
      his knife and fork, somebody put out a hand to shake with him. Martin and
      Mary had taken him aside before dinner, and spoken to him so heartily of
      the time to come, laying such fervent stress upon the trust they had in
      his completion of their felicity, by his society and closest friendship,
      that Tom was positively moved to tears. He couldn&rsquo;t bear it. His heart was
      full, he said, of happiness. And so it was. Tom spoke the honest truth. It
      was. Large as thy heart was, dear Tom Pinch, it had no room that day for
      anything but happiness and sympathy!
    </p>
    <p>
      And there was Fips, old Fips of Austin Friars, present at the dinner, and
      turning out to be the jolliest old dog that ever did violence to his
      convivial sentiments by shutting himself up in a dark office. &lsquo;Where is
      he?&rsquo; said Fips, when he came in. And then he pounced on Tom, and told him
      that he wanted to relieve himself of all his old constraint; and in the
      first place shook him by one hand, and in the second place shook him by
      the other, and in the third place nudged him in the waistcoat, and in the
      fourth place said, &lsquo;How are you?&rsquo; and in a great many other places did a
      great many other things to show his friendliness and joy. And he sang
      songs, did Fips; and made speeches, did Fips; and knocked off his wine
      pretty handsomely, did Fips; and in short, he showed himself a perfect
      Trump, did Fips, in all respects.
    </p>
    <p>
      But ah! the happiness of strolling home at night&mdash;obstinate little
      Ruth, she wouldn&rsquo;t hear of riding!&mdash;as they had done on that dear
      night, from Furnival&rsquo;s Inn! The happiness of being able to talk about it,
      and to confide their happiness to each other! The happiness of stating all
      their little plans to Tom, and seeing his bright face grow brighter as
      they spoke!
    </p>
    <p>
      When they reached home, Tom left John and his sister in the parlour, and
      went upstairs into his own room, under pretence of seeking a book. And Tom
      actually winked to himself when he got upstairs; he thought it such a deep
      thing to have done.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;They like to be by themselves, of course,&rsquo; said Tom; &lsquo;and I came away so
      naturally, that I have no doubt they are expecting me, every moment, to
      return. That&rsquo;s capital!&rsquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      But he had not sat reading very long, when he heard a tap at his door.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;May I come in?&rsquo; said John.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Oh, surely!&rsquo; Tom replied.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Don&rsquo;t leave us, Tom. Don&rsquo;t sit by yourself. We want to make you merry;
      not melancholy.&rsquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;My dear friend,&rsquo; said Tom, with a cheerful smile.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Brother, Tom. Brother.&rsquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;My dear brother,&rsquo; said Tom; &lsquo;there is no danger of my being melancholy,
      how can I be melancholy, when I know that you and Ruth are so blest in
      each other! I think I can find my tongue tonight, John,&rsquo; he added, after a
      moment&rsquo;s pause. &lsquo;But I never can tell you what unutterable joy this day
      has given me. It would be unjust to you to speak of your having chosen a
      portionless girl, for I feel that you know her worth; I am sure you know
      her worth. Nor will it diminish in your estimation, John, which money
      might.&rsquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Which money would, Tom,&rsquo; he returned. &lsquo;Her worth! Oh, who could see her
      here, and not love her! Who could know her, Tom, and not honour her! Who
      could ever stand possessed of such a heart as hers, and grow indifferent
      to the treasure! Who could feel the rapture that I feel to-day, and love
      as I love her, Tom, without knowing something of her worth! Your joy
      unutterable! No, no, Tom. It&rsquo;s mine, it&rsquo;s mine.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;No, no, John,&rsquo; said Tom. &lsquo;It&rsquo;s mine, it&rsquo;s mine.&rsquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      Their friendly contention was brought to a close by little Ruth herself,
      who came peeping in at the door. And oh, the look, the glorious,
      half-proud, half-timid look she gave Tom, when her lover drew her to his
      side! As much as to say, &lsquo;Yes, indeed, Tom, he will do it. But then he has
      a right, you know. Because I <i>am</i> fond of him, Tom.&rsquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      As to Tom, he was perfectly delighted. He could have sat and looked at
      them, just as they were, for hours.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;I have told Tom, love, as we agreed, that we are not going to permit him
      to run away, and that we cannot possibly allow it. The loss of one person,
      and such a person as Tom, too, out of our small household of three, is not
      to be endured; and so I have told him. Whether he is considerate, or
      whether he is only selfish, I don&rsquo;t know. But he needn&rsquo;t be considerate,
      for he is not the least restraint upon us. Is he, dearest Ruth?&rsquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      Well! He really did not seem to be any particular restraint upon them.
      Judging from what ensued.
    </p>
    <p>
      Was it folly in Tom to be so pleased by their remembrance of him at such a
      time? Was their graceful love a folly, were their dear caresses follies,
      was their lengthened parting folly? Was it folly in him to watch her
      window from the street, and rate its scantiest gleam of light above all
      diamonds; folly in her to breathe his name upon her knees, and pour out
      her pure heart before that Being from whom such hearts and such affections
      come?
    </p>
    <p>
      If these be follies, then Fiery Face go on and prosper! If they be not,
      then Fiery Face avaunt! But set the crunched bonnet at some other single
      gentleman, in any case, for one is lost to thee for ever!

      CHAPTER FIFTY-FOUR
    </h2>
    <h3>
      GIVES THE AUTHOR GREAT CONCERN. FOR IT IS THE LAST IN THE BOOK
    </h3>
    <p>
      Todger&rsquo;s was in high feather, and mighty preparations for a late breakfast
      were astir in its commercial bowers. The blissful morning had arrived when
      Miss Pecksniff was to be united in holy matrimony, to Augustus.
    </p>
    <p>
      Miss Pecksniff was in a frame of mind equally becoming to herself and the
      occasion. She was full of clemency and conciliation. She had laid in
      several caldrons of live coals, and was prepared to heap them on the heads
      of her enemies. She bore no spite nor malice in her heart. Not the least.
    </p>
    <p>
      Quarrels, Miss Pecksniff said, were dreadful things in families; and
      though she never could forgive her dear papa, she was willing to receive
      her other relations. They had been separated, she observed, too long. It
      was enough to call down a judgment upon the family. She believed the death
      of Jonas <i>was </i>a judgment on them for their internal dissensions. And Miss
      Pecksniff was confirmed in this belief, by the lightness with which the
      visitation had fallen on herself.
    </p>
    <p>
      By way of doing sacrifice&mdash;not in triumph; not, of course, in
      triumph, but in humiliation of spirit&mdash;this amiable young person
      wrote, therefore, to her kinswoman of the strong mind, and informed her
      that her nuptials would take place on such a day. That she had been much
      hurt by the unnatural conduct of herself and daughters, and hoped they
      might not have suffered in their consciences. That, being desirous to
      forgive her enemies, and make her peace with the world before entering
      into the most solemn of covenants with the most devoted of men, she now
      held out the hand of friendship. That if the strong-minded women took that
      hand, in the temper in which it was extended to her, she, Miss Pecksniff,
      did invite her to be present at the ceremony of her marriage, and did
      furthermore invite the three red-nosed spinsters, her daughters (but Miss
      Pecksniff did not particularize their noses), to attend as bridesmaids.
    </p>
    <p>
      The strong-minded women returned for answer, that herself and daughters
      were, as regarded their consciences, in the enjoyment of robust health,
      which she knew Miss Pecksniff would be glad to hear. That she had received
      Miss Pecksniff&rsquo;s note with unalloyed delight, because she never had
      attached the least importance to the paltry and insignificant jealousies
      with which herself and circle had been assailed; otherwise than as she had
      found them, in the contemplation, a harmless source of innocent mirth.
      That she would joyfully attend Miss Pecksniff&rsquo;s bridal; and that her three
      dear daughters would be happy to assist, on so interesting, and <i>so very
            unexpected</i>&mdash;which the strong-minded woman underlined&mdash;<i>so very unexpected</i> an occasion.
    </p>
    <p>
      On the receipt of this gracious reply, Miss Pecksniff extended her
      forgiveness and her invitations to Mr and Mrs Spottletoe; to Mr George
      Chuzzlewit the bachelor cousin; to the solitary female who usually had the
      toothache; and to the hairy young gentleman with the outline of a face;
      surviving remnants of the party that had once assembled in Mr Pecksniff&rsquo;s
      parlour. After which Miss Pecksniff remarked that there was a sweetness in
      doing our duty, which neutralized the bitter in our cups.
    </p>
    <p>
      The wedding guests had not yet assembled, and indeed it was so early that
      Miss Pecksniff herself was in the act of dressing at her leisure, when a
      carriage stopped near the Monument; and Mark, dismounting from the rumble,
      assisted Mr Chuzzlewit to alight. The carriage remained in waiting; so did
      Mr Tapley. Mr Chuzzlewit betook himself to Todger&rsquo;s.
    </p>
    <p>
      He was shown, by the degenerate successor of Mr Bailey, into the
      dining-parlour; where&mdash;for his visit was expected&mdash;Mrs Todgers
      immediately appeared.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;You are dressed, I see, for the wedding,&rsquo; he said.
    </p>
    <p>
      Mrs Todgers, who was greatly flurried by the preparations, replied in the
      affirmative.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;It goes against my wishes to have it in progress just now, I assure you,
      sir,&rsquo; said Mrs Todgers; &lsquo;but Miss Pecksniff&rsquo;s mind was set upon it, and it
      really is time that Miss Pecksniff was married. That cannot be denied,
      sir.&rsquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;No,&rsquo; said Mr Chuzzlewit, &lsquo;assuredly not. Her sister takes no part in the
      proceedings?&rsquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Oh, dear no, sir. Poor thing!&rsquo; said Mrs Todgers, shaking her head, and
      dropping her voice. &lsquo;Since she has known the worst, she has never left my
      room; the next room.&rsquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Is she prepared to see me?&rsquo; he inquired.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Quite prepared, sir.&rsquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Then let us lose no time.&rsquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      Mrs Todgers conducted him into the little back chamber commanding the
      prospect of the cistern; and there, sadly different from when it had first
      been her lodging, sat poor Merry, in mourning weeds. The room looked very
      dark and sorrowful; and so did she; but she had one friend beside her,
      faithful to the last. Old Chuffey.
    </p>
    <p>
      When Mr Chuzzlewit sat down at her side, she took his hand and put it to
      her lips. She was in great grief. He too was agitated; for he had not seen
      her since their parting in the churchyard.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;I judged you hastily,&rsquo; he said, in a low voice. &lsquo;I fear I judged you
      cruelly. Let me know that I have your forgiveness.&rsquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      She kissed his hand again; and retaining it in hers, thanked him in a
      broken voice, for all his kindness to her since.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Tom Pinch,&rsquo; said Martin, &lsquo;has faithfully related to me all that you
      desired him to convey; at a time when he deemed it very improbable that he
      would ever have an opportunity of delivering your message. Believe me,
      that if I ever deal again with an ill-advised and unawakened nature,
      hiding the strength it thinks its weakness, I will have long and merciful
      consideration for it.&rsquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;You had for me; even for me,&rsquo; she answered. &lsquo;I quite believe it. I said
      the words you have repeated, when my distress was very sharp and hard to
      bear; I say them now for others; but I cannot urge them for myself. You
      spoke to me after you had seen and watched me day by day. There was great
      consideration in that. You might have spoken, perhaps, more kindly; you
      might have tried to invite my confidence by greater gentleness; but the
      end would have been the same.&rsquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      He shook his head in doubt, and not without some inward self-reproach.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;How can I hope,&rsquo; she said, &lsquo;that your interposition would have prevailed
      with me, when I know how obdurate I was! I never thought at all; dear Mr
      Chuzzlewit, I never thought at all; I had no thought, no heart, no care to
      find one; at that time. It has grown out of my trouble. I have felt it in
      my trouble. I wouldn&rsquo;t recall my trouble such as it is and has been&mdash;and
      it is light in comparison with trials which hundreds of good people suffer
      every day, I know&mdash;I wouldn&rsquo;t recall it to-morrow, if I could. It has
      been my friend, for without it no one could have changed me; nothing could
      have changed me. Do not mistrust me because of these tears; I cannot help
      them. I am grateful for it, in my soul. Indeed I am!&rsquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Indeed she is!&rsquo; said Mrs Todgers. &lsquo;I believe it, sir.&rsquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;And so do I!&rsquo; said Mr Chuzzlewit. &lsquo;Now, attend to me, my dear. Your late
      husband&rsquo;s estate, if not wasted by the confession of a large debt to the
      broken office (which document, being useless to the runaways, has been
      sent over to England by them; not so much for the sake of the creditors as
      for the gratification of their dislike to him, whom they suppose to be
      still living), will be seized upon by law; for it is not exempt, as I
      learn, from the claims of those who have suffered by the fraud in which he
      was engaged. Your father&rsquo;s property was all, or nearly all, embarked in
      the same transaction. If there be any left, it will be seized on, in like
      manner. There is no home <i>there</i>.&rsquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;I couldn&rsquo;t return to him,&rsquo; she said, with an instinctive reference to his
      having forced her marriage on. &lsquo;I could not return to him.&rsquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;I know it,&rsquo; Mr Chuzzlewit resumed; &lsquo;and I am here because I know it. Come
      with me! From all who are about me, you are certain (I have ascertained
      it) of a generous welcome. But until your health is re-established, and
      you are sufficiently composed to bear that welcome, you shall have your
      abode in any quiet retreat of your own choosing, near London; not so far
      removed but that this kind-hearted lady may still visit you as often as
      she pleases. You have suffered much; but you are young, and have a
      brighter and a better future stretching out before you. Come with me. Your
      sister is careless of you, I know. She hurries on and publishes her
      marriage, in a spirit which (to say no more of it) is barely decent, is
      unsisterly, and bad. Leave the house before her guests arrive. She means
      to give you pain. Spare her the offence, and come with me!&rsquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      Mrs Todgers, though most unwilling to part with her, added her
      persuasions. Even poor old Chuffey (of course included in the project)
      added his. She hurriedly attired herself, and was ready to depart, when
      Miss Pecksniff dashed into the room.
    </p>
    <p>
      Miss Pecksniff dashed in so suddenly, that she was placed in an
      embarrassing position. For though she had completed her bridal toilette as
      to her head, on which she wore a bridal bonnet with orange flowers, she
      had not completed it as to her skirts, which displayed no choicer
      decoration than a dimity bedgown. She had dashed in, in fact, about
      half-way through, to console her sister, in her affliction, with a sight
      of the aforesaid bonnet; and being quite unconscious of the presence of a
      visitor, until she found Mr Chuzzlewit standing face to face with her, her
      surprise was an uncomfortable one.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;So, young lady!&rsquo; said the old man, eyeing her with strong disfavour. &lsquo;You
      are to be married to-day!&rsquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Yes, sir,&rsquo; returned Miss Pecksniff, modestly. &lsquo;I am. I&mdash;my dress is
      rather&mdash;really, Mrs Todgers!&rsquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Your delicacy,&rsquo; said old Martin, &lsquo;is troubled, I perceive. I am not
      surprised to find it so. You have chosen the period of your marriage
      unfortunately.&rsquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;I beg your pardon, Mr Chuzzlewit,&rsquo; retorted Cherry; very red and angry in
      a moment; &lsquo;but if you have anything to say on that subject, I must beg to
      refer you to Augustus. You will scarcely think it manly, I hope, to force
      an argument on me, when Augustus is at all times ready to discuss it with
      you. I have nothing to do with any deceptions that may have been practiced
      on my parent,&rsquo; said Miss Pecksniff, pointedly; &lsquo;and as I wish to be on
      good terms with everybody at such a time, I should have been glad if you
      would have favoured us with your company at breakfast. But I will not ask
      you as it is; seeing that you have been prepossessed and set against me in
      another quarter. I hope I have my natural affections for another quarter,
      and my natural pity for another quarter; but I cannot always submit to be
      subservient to it, Mr Chuzzlewit. That would be a little too much. I trust
      I have more respect for myself, as well as for the man who claims me as
      his Bride.&rsquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Your sister, meeting&mdash;as I think; not as she says, for she has said
      nothing about it&mdash;with little consideration from you, is going away
      with me,&rsquo; said Mr Chuzzlewit.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;I am very happy to find that she has some good fortune at last,&rsquo; returned
      Miss Pecksniff, tossing her head. &lsquo;I congratulate her, I am sure. I am not
      surprised that this event should be painful to her&mdash;painful to her&mdash;but
      I can&rsquo;t help that, Mr Chuzzlewit. It&rsquo;s not my fault.&rsquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Come, Miss Pecksniff!&rsquo; said the old man, quietly. &lsquo;I should like to see a
      better parting between you. I should like to see a better parting on your
      side, in such circumstances. It would make me your friend. You may want a
      friend one day or other.&rsquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Every relation of life, Mr Chuzzlewit, begging your pardon; and every
      friend in life,&rsquo; returned Miss Pecksniff, with dignity, &lsquo;is now bound up
      and cemented in Augustus. So long as Augustus is my own, I cannot want a
      friend. When you speak of friends, sir, I must beg, once for all, to refer
      you to Augustus. That is my impression of the religious ceremony in which
      I am so soon to take a part at that altar to which Augustus will conduct
      me. I bear no malice at any time, much less in a moment of triumph,
      towards any one; much less towards my sister. On the contrary, I
      congratulate her. If you didn&rsquo;t hear me say so, I am not to blame. And as
      I owe it to Augustus, to be punctual on an occasion when he may naturally
      be supposed to be&mdash;to be impatient&mdash;really, Mrs Todgers!&mdash;I
      must beg your leave, sir, to retire.&rsquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      After these words the bridal bonnet disappeared; with as much state as the
      dimity bedgown left in it.
    </p>
    <p>
      Old Martin gave his arm to the younger sister without speaking; and led
      her out. Mrs Todgers, with her holiday garments fluttering in the wind,
      accompanied them to the carriage, clung round Merry&rsquo;s neck at parting, and
      ran back to her own dingy house, crying the whole way. She had a lean,
      lank body, Mrs Todgers, but a well-conditioned soul within. Perhaps the
      good Samaritan was lean and lank, and found it hard to live. Who knows!
    </p>
    <p>
      Mr Chuzzlewit followed her so closely with his eyes, that, until she had
      shut her own door, they did not encounter Mr Tapley&rsquo;s face.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Why, Mark!&rsquo; he said, as soon as he observed it, &lsquo;what&rsquo;s the matter?&rsquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;The wonderfulest ewent, sir!&rsquo; returned Mark, pumping at his voice in a
      most laborious manner, and hardly able to articulate with all his efforts.
      &lsquo;A coincidence as never was equalled! I&rsquo;m blessed if here ain&rsquo;t two old
      neighbours of ourn, sir!&rsquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;What neighbours?&rsquo; cried old Martin, looking out of window. &lsquo;Where?&rsquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;I was a-walkin&rsquo; up and down not five yards from this spot,&rsquo; said Mr
      Tapley, breathless, &lsquo;and they come upon me like their own ghosts, as I
      thought they was! It&rsquo;s the wonderfulest ewent that ever happened. Bring a
      feather, somebody, and knock me down with it!&rsquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;What do you mean!&rsquo; exclaimed old Martin, quite as much excited by the
      spectacle of Mark&rsquo;s excitement as that strange person was himself.
      &lsquo;Neighbours, where?&rsquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Here, sir!&rsquo; replied Mr Tapley. &lsquo;Here in the city of London! Here upon
      these very stones! Here they are, sir! Don&rsquo;t I know &lsquo;em? Lord love their
      welcome faces, don&rsquo;t I know &lsquo;em!&rsquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      With which ejaculations Mr Tapley not only pointed to a decent-looking man
      and woman standing by, but commenced embracing them alternately, over and
      over again, in Monument Yard.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Neighbours, <i>where</i>? old Martin shouted; almost maddened by his ineffectual
      efforts to get out at the coach-door.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Neighbours in America! Neighbours in Eden!&rsquo; cried Mark. &lsquo;Neighbours in
      the swamp, neighbours in the bush, neighbours in the fever. Didn&rsquo;t she
      nurse us! Didn&rsquo;t he help us! Shouldn&rsquo;t we both have died without &lsquo;em!
      Haven&rsquo;t they come a-strugglin&rsquo; back, without a single child for their
      consolation! And talk to me of neighbours!&rsquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      Away he went again, in a perfectly wild state, hugging them, and skipping
      round them, and cutting in between them, as if he were performing some
      frantic and outlandish dance.
    </p>
    <p>
      Mr Chuzzlewit no sooner gathered who these people were, than he burst open
      the coach-door somehow or other, and came tumbling out among them; and as
      if the lunacy of Mr Tapley were contagious, he immediately began to shake
      hands too, and exhibit every demonstration of the liveliest joy.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Get up, behind!&rsquo; he said. &lsquo;Get up in the rumble. Come along with me! Go
      you on the box, Mark. Home! Home!&rsquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Home!&rsquo; cried Mr Tapley, seizing the old man&rsquo;s hand in a burst of
      enthusiasm. &lsquo;Exactly my opinion, sir. Home for ever! Excuse the liberty,
      sir, I can&rsquo;t help it. Success to the Jolly Tapley! There&rsquo;s nothin&rsquo; in the
      house they shan&rsquo;t have for the askin&rsquo; for, except a bill. Home to be sure!
      Hurrah!&rsquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      Home they rolled accordingly, when he had got the old man in again, as
      fast as they could go; Mark abating nothing of his fervour by the way, by
      allowing it to vent itself as unrestrainedly as if he had been on
      Salisbury Plain.
    </p>
    <p>
      And now the wedding party began to assemble at Todgers&rsquo;s. Mr Jinkins, the
      only boarder invited, was on the ground first. He wore a white favour in
      his button-hole, and a bran new extra super double-milled blue saxony
      dress coat (that was its description in the bill), with a variety of
      tortuous embellishments about the pockets, invented by the artist to do
      honour to the day. The miserable Augustus no longer felt strongly even on
      the subject of Jinkins. He hadn&rsquo;t strength of mind enough to do it. &lsquo;Let
      him come!&rsquo; he had said, in answer to Miss Pecksniff, when she urged the
      point. &lsquo;Let him come! He has ever been my rock ahead through life. &lsquo;Tis
      meet he should be there. Ha, ha! Oh, yes! let Jinkins come!&rsquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      Jinkins had come with all the pleasure in life, and there he was. For some
      few minutes he had no companion but the breakfast, which was set forth in
      the drawing-room, with unusual taste and ceremony. But Mrs Todgers soon
      joined him; and the bachelor cousin, the hairy young gentleman, and Mr and
      Mrs Spottletoe, arrived in quick succession.
    </p>
    <p>
      Mr Spottletoe honoured Jinkins with an encouraging bow. &lsquo;Glad to know you,
      sir,&rsquo; he said. &lsquo;Give you joy!&rsquo; Under the impression that Jinkins was the
      happy man.
    </p>
    <p>
      Mr Jinkins explained. He was merely doing the honours for his friend
      Moddle, who had ceased to reside in the house, and had not yet arrived.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Not arrived, sir!&rsquo; exclaimed Spottletoe, in a great heat.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Not yet,&rsquo; said Mr Jinkins.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Upon my soul!&rsquo; cried Spottletoe. &lsquo;He begins well! Upon my life and honour
      this young man begins well! But I should very much like to know how it is
      that every one who comes into contact with this family is guilty of some
      gross insult to it. Death! Not arrived yet. Not here to receive us!&rsquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      The nephew with the outline of a countenance, suggested that perhaps he
      had ordered a new pair of boots, and they hadn&rsquo;t come home.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Don&rsquo;t talk to me of Boots, sir!&rsquo; retorted Spottletoe, with immense
      indignation. &lsquo;He is bound to come here in his slippers then; he is bound
      to come here barefoot. Don&rsquo;t offer such a wretched and evasive plea to me
      on behalf of your friend, as Boots, sir.&rsquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;He is not <i>my</i> friend,&rsquo; said the nephew. &lsquo;I never saw him.&rsquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Very well, sir,&rsquo; returned the fiery Spottletoe. &lsquo;Then don&rsquo;t talk to me!&rsquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      The door was thrown open at this juncture, and Miss Pecksniff entered,
      tottering, and supported by her three bridesmaids. The strong-minded woman
      brought up the rear; having waited outside until now, for the purpose of
      spoiling the effect.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;How do you do, ma&rsquo;am!&rsquo; said Spottletoe to the strong-minded woman in a
      tone of defiance. &lsquo;I believe you see Mrs Spottletoe, ma&rsquo;am?&rsquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      The strong-minded woman with an air of great interest in Mrs Spottletoe&rsquo;s
      health, regretted that she was not more easily seen. Nature erring, in
      that lady&rsquo;s case, upon the slim side.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Mrs Spottletoe is at least more easily seen than the bridegroom, ma&rsquo;am,&rsquo;
      returned that lady&rsquo;s husband. &lsquo;That is, unless he has confined his
      attentions to any particular part or branch of this family, which would be
      quite in keeping with its usual proceedings.&rsquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;If you allude to me, sir&mdash;&rsquo; the strong-minded woman began.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Pray,&rsquo; interposed Miss Pecksniff, &lsquo;do not allow Augustus, at this awful
      moment of his life and mine, to be the means of disturbing that harmony
      which it is ever Augustus&rsquo;s and my wish to maintain. Augustus has not been
      introduced to any of my relations now present. He preferred not.&rsquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Why, then, I venture to assert,&rsquo; cried Mr Spottletoe, &lsquo;that the man who
      aspires to join this family, and &ldquo;prefers not&rdquo; to be introduced to its
      members, is an impertinent Puppy. That is my opinion of <i>him</i>!&rsquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      The strong-minded woman remarked with great suavity, that she was afraid
      he must be. Her three daughters observed aloud that it was &lsquo;Shameful!&rsquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;You do not know Augustus,&rsquo; said Miss Pecksniff, tearfully, &lsquo;indeed you do
      not know him. Augustus is all mildness and humility. Wait till you see
      Augustus, and I am sure he will conciliate your affections.&rsquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;The question arises,&rsquo; said Spottletoe, folding his arms: &lsquo;How long we are
      to wait. I am not accustomed to wait; that&rsquo;s the fact. And I want to know
      how long we are expected to wait.&rsquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Mrs Todgers!&rsquo; said Charity, &lsquo;Mr Jinkins! I am afraid there must be some
      mistake. I think Augustus must have gone straight to the Altar!&rsquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      As such a thing was possible, and the church was close at hand, Mr Jinkins
      ran off to see, accompanied by Mr George Chuzzlewit the bachelor cousin,
      who preferred anything to the aggravation of sitting near the breakfast,
      without being able to eat it. But they came back with no other tidings
      than a familiar message from the clerk, importing that if they wanted to
      be married that morning they had better look sharp, as the curate wasn&rsquo;t
      going to wait there all day.
    </p>
    <p>
      The bride was now alarmed; seriously alarmed. Good Heavens, what could
      have happened! Augustus! Dear Augustus!
    </p>
    <p>
      Mr Jinkins volunteered to take a cab, and seek him at the newly-furnished
      house. The strong-minded woman administered comfort to Miss Pecksniff. &lsquo;It
      was a specimen of what she had to expect. It would do her good. It would
      dispel the romance of the affair.&rsquo; The red-nosed daughters also
      administered the kindest comfort. &lsquo;Perhaps he&rsquo;d come,&rsquo; they said. The
      sketchy nephew hinted that he might have fallen off a bridge. The wrath of
      Mr Spottletoe resisted all the entreaties of his wife. Everybody spoke at
      once, and Miss Pecksniff, with clasped hands, sought consolation
      everywhere and found it nowhere, when Jinkins, having met the postman at
      the door, came back with a letter, which he put into her hand.
    </p>
    <p>
      Miss Pecksniff opened it, uttered a piercing shriek, threw it down upon
      the ground, and fainted away.
    </p>

    </h5>
    <p>
      They picked it up; and crowding round, and looking over one another&rsquo;s
      shoulders, read, in the words and dashes following, this communication:
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;<i>Off Gravesend. &lsquo;Clipper Schooner, Cupid</i>
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Wednesday night
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;<i>Ever Injured Miss Pecksniff</i>&mdash;Ere this reaches you, the undersigned
      will be&mdash;if not a corpse&mdash;on the way to Van Dieman&rsquo;s Land. Send
      not in pursuit. I never will be taken alive!
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;The burden&mdash;300 tons per register&mdash;forgive, if in my
      distraction, I allude to the ship&mdash;on my mind&mdash;has been truly
      dreadful. Frequently&mdash;when you have sought to soothe my brow with
      kisses&mdash;has self-destruction flashed across me. Frequently&mdash;incredible
      as it may seem&mdash;have I abandoned the idea.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;I love another. She is Another&rsquo;s. Everything appears to be somebody
      else&rsquo;s. Nothing in the world is mine&mdash;not even my Situation&mdash;which
      I have forfeited&mdash;by my rash conduct&mdash;in running away.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;If you ever loved me, hear my last appeal! The last appeal of a miserable
      and blighted exile. Forward the inclosed&mdash;it is the key of my desk&mdash;to
      the office&mdash;by hand. Please address to Bobbs and Cholberry&mdash;I
      mean to Chobbs and Bolberry&mdash;but my mind is totally unhinged. I left
      a penknife&mdash;with a buckhorn handle&mdash;in your work-box. It will
      repay the messenger. May it make him happier than ever it did me!
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Oh, Miss Pecksniff, why didn&rsquo;t you leave me alone! Was it not cruel,
      <i>cruel</i>! Oh, my goodness, have you not been a witness of my feelings&mdash;have
      you not seen them flowing from my eyes&mdash;did you not, yourself,
      reproach me with weeping more than usual on that dreadful night when last
      we met&mdash;in that house&mdash;where I once was peaceful&mdash;though
      blighted&mdash;in the society of Mrs Todgers!
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;But it was written&mdash;in the Talmud&mdash;that you should involve
      yourself in the inscrutable and gloomy Fate which it is my mission to
      accomplish, and which wreathes itself&mdash;e&rsquo;en now&mdash;about in
      temples. I will not reproach, for I have wronged you. May the Furniture
      make some amends!
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Farewell! Be the proud bride of a ducal coronet, and forget me! Long may
      it be before you know the anguish with which I now subscribe myself&mdash;amid
      the tempestuous howlings of the&mdash;sailors,
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Unalterably,
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Never yours,
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;<i>Augustus.</i>&rsquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      They thought as little of Miss Pecksniff, while they greedily perused this
      letter, as if she were the very last person on earth whom it concerned.
      But Miss Pecksniff really had fainted away. The bitterness of her
      mortification; the bitterness of having summoned witnesses, and such
      witnesses, to behold it; the bitterness of knowing that the strong-minded
      women and the red-nosed daughters towered triumphant in this hour of their
      anticipated overthrow; was too much to be borne. Miss Pecksniff had
      fainted away in earnest.
    </p>
    <p>
      What sounds are these that fall so grandly on the ear! What darkening room
      is this!
    </p>
    <p>
      And that mild figure seated at an organ, who is he! Ah Tom, dear Tom, old
      friend!
    </p>
    <p>
      Thy head is prematurely grey, though Time has passed thee and our old
      association, Tom. But, in those sounds with which it is thy wont to bear
      the twilight company, the music of thy heart speaks out&mdash;the story of
      thy life relates itself.
    </p>
    <p>
      Thy life is tranquil, calm, and happy, Tom. In the soft strain which ever
      and again comes stealing back upon the ear, the memory of thine old love
      may find a voice perhaps; but it is a pleasant, softened, whispering
      memory, like that in which we sometimes hold the dead, and does not pain
      or grieve thee, God be thanked.
    </p>
    <p>
      Touch the notes lightly, Tom, as lightly as thou wilt, but never will
      thine hand fall half so lightly on that Instrument as on the head of thine
      old tyrant brought down very, very low; and never will it make as hollow a
      response to any touch of thine, as he does always.
    </p>
    <p>
      For a drunken, begging, squalid, letter-writing man, called Pecksniff,
      with a shrewish daughter, haunts thee, Tom; and when he makes appeals to
      thee for cash, reminds thee that he built thy fortunes better than his
      own; and when he spends it, entertains the alehouse company with tales of
      thine ingratitude and his munificence towards thee once upon a time; and
      then he shows his elbows worn in holes, and puts his soleless shoes up on
      a bench, and begs his auditors look there, while thou art comfortably
      housed and clothed. All known to thee, and yet all borne with, Tom!
    </p>
    <p>
      So, with a smile upon thy face, thou passest gently to another measure&mdash;to
      a quicker and more joyful one&mdash;and little feet are used to dance
      about thee at the sound, and bright young eyes to glance up into thine.
      And there is one slight creature, Tom&mdash;her child; not Ruth&rsquo;s&mdash;whom
      thine eyes follow in the romp and dance; who, wondering sometimes to see
      thee look so thoughtful, runs to climb up on thy knee, and put her cheek
      to thine; who loves thee, Tom, above the rest, if that can be; and falling
      sick once, chose thee for her nurse, and never knew impatience, Tom, when
      thou wert by her side.
    </p>
    <p>
      Thou glidest, now, into a graver air; an air devoted to old friends and
      bygone times; and in thy lingering touch upon the keys, and the rich
      swelling of the mellow harmony, they rise before thee. The spirit of that
      old man dead, who delighted to anticipate thy wants, and never ceased to
      honour thee, is there, among the rest; repeating, with a face composed and
      calm, the words he said to thee upon his bed, and blessing thee!
    </p>
    <p>
      And coming from a garden, Tom, bestrewn with flowers by children&rsquo;s hands,
      thy sister, little Ruth, as light of foot and heart as in old days, sits
      down beside thee. From the Present, and the Past, with which she is so
      tenderly entwined in all thy thoughts, thy strain soars onward to the
      Future. As it resounds within thee and without, the noble music, rolling
      round ye both, shuts out the grosser prospect of an earthly parting, and
      uplifts ye both to Heaven!
    </p>
    <p>

&ldquo;Defects,&rdquo; such as, but not limited to, incomplete, inaccurate or
corrupt data, transcription errors, a copyright or other intellectual
property infringement, a defective or damaged disk or other medium, a
computer virus, or computer codes that damage or cannot be read by

Section  2.  Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg-tm

Project Gutenberg-tm is synonymous with the free distribution of
electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of computers
including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers.  It exists
because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations from
people in all walks of life.

Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
assistance they need, is critical to reaching Project Gutenberg-tm&rsquo;s
goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg-tm collection will
remain freely available for generations to come.  In 2001, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure
and permanent future for Project Gutenberg-tm and future generations.

and how your efforts and donations can help, see Sections 3 and 4

Section 4.  Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg
Literary Archive Foundation

Project Gutenberg-tm depends upon and cannot survive without wide
spread public support and donations to carry out its mission of
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
freely distributed in machine readable form accessible by the widest
array of equipment including outdated equipment.  Many small donations
($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
status with the IRS.

The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
States.  Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements.  We do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance.  To
SEND DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any
particular state visit http://pglaf.org

While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate.

International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
outside the United States.  U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.

Please check the Project Gutenberg Web pages for current donation
methods and addresses.  Donations are accepted in a number of other
ways including checks, online payments and credit card donations.
To donate, please visit: http://pglaf.org/donate


Section 5.  General Information About Project Gutenberg-tm electronic
works.

Professor Michael S. Hart is the originator of the Project Gutenberg-tm
concept of a library of electronic works that could be freely shared
with anyone.  For thirty years, he produced and distributed Project
Gutenberg-tm eBooks with only a loose network of volunteer support.


Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as Public Domain in the U.S.
unless a copyright notice is included.  Thus, we do not necessarily
keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper edition.


Most people start at our Web site which has the main PG search facility:

     http://www.gutenberg.org

This Web site includes information about Project Gutenberg-tm,
including how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to
subscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.
